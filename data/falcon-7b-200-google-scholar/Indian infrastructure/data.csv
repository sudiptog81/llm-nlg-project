Indian infrastructure,The significance and performance of infrastructure in India,"The significance and performance of infrastructure in India’s economy is well documented. In fact, infrastructure accounts for over 50% of the gross domestic product of India and about 30% to 40% share of its labour force is related to the infrastructure sector, which is why infrastructure projects play a key role in job creation and economic growth.
However, the government’ s focus has always been on improving connectivity and infrastructure. This is the reason why, even in the midst of a pandemic, work has been undertaken on a large-scale and has not been hampered in any way. It is only a matter of time before the country is back on its feet once more. But the pandemic has also exposed some weaknesses, including the lack of digital infrastructure and a robust IT backbone. These are now at the top of everyone’S list of priorities. The government needs to focus more on the digital economy. There is a need for a digital transformation of our society, economy and governance.",3,191

AbstractThis paper analyzes the impact of government infrastructure on the location choice of manufacturing firms, the role of transport and infrastructure in the transmission of external spillovers of pollution and the relationship between the development of infrastructure and regional industrialization. We use the Census of Manufacturing Industries in India to study the determinants of location and capital structure, as well as the effects of regional differences in infrastructure quality on industrial location. The results confirm that there is a relationship of causation between infrastructure investment and industrial growth. However, there does not seem to be any direct relationship in terms of a positive impact on manufacturing employment. Furthermore, it seems to imply that the quality of roads is the most significant determinant of industrial development. Finally, we also show that infrastructure has a strong impact in reducing the level of environmental pollution generated. This implies that investment in roads may be a more efficient way of improving the environment rather than investment to improve the efficiency of production: 111",4,189

Abstract
This paper examines the development finance institutions (DFI) in general and infrastructure development financial intermediation specifically with emphasis on the Brazilian National Development Bank ‘BNDE’ in particular. It examines DFIs role in the infrastructure value chain from the perspective of infrastructure funding in Brazil and India.
The paper argues that DFEs can play key role as catalysts of economic growth in developing countries through infrastructure financing. This can be done by providing financial guarantees or by directly funding the construction of projects. DFAs provide financial guarantee to private and public investors for financing infrastructure projects in a country where there is lack of institutional financing or a weak credit rating system. In addition, the paper shows that infrastructure investment can create employment and increase productivity. The paper also suggests ways of promoting infrastructure in Nigeria in order for the country to benefit from such projects as is the case with China and South Korea. These countries are the most successful",6,186

Abstract
In the recent decade, the consulting and outsourcing sector has become a key contributor to the growth of Indian economy and it plays a significant role in the overall growth. The consulting industry is one of most profitable sectors in India. However, in such competitive industry, knowledge has always been a crucial factor. This is why, there is a great need to understand how the organization structure affect the knowledge of employees. There is also much research on the organizational structures; however, it is limited in its application to other sectors. Therefore, with a view to explore the role of organizational design on knowledge management in this sector, a case study has been conducted on Infrastructure consulting companies. It is found that the structure of organization has the significant relationship on Knowledge retention.

The government has set up a ""National Council on Infrastructure"" which is considering the issues related to privatisation, concession, and the role of the government in infrastructure. In a series of meetings and consultations with the private and public sector, the Council is expected to come up with policy recommendations by the end of 1999.
India's infrastructure sector will undergo a radical change with an influx of private funds in coming months. However, it faces a major hurdle in that it has not yet created a legal framework in which private entities can participate in this market. A key challenge is that the Indian infrastructure industry is not ready for private participation and private investors are not clear in their mind the exact role they would like to play in an infrastructure project.

Rural Infrastructure Development
The concept of infrastructure was given a new lease of life in the early 2000, in response to the globalisation and market liberalisation, which is taking place in India and the world in general. Infrastructure is defined in its broadest form as “physical infrastructure” that provides the essential services for people to sustain life, including housing, sanitation, water, transportation, education and health. (World Bank 1998).
In rural areas, infrastructure is a vital component of development as it is an essential prerequisite for development activities. For example roads, power, communication and drinking water facilities are some of the infrastructure which are essential for economic development.
However, these essential infrastructure facilities need to be provided at affordable prices and at a sustainable scale to all. There are three main reasons for the failure of rural infrastructure development",17,189

In uncertain situations, organizations often face the difficulty of identifying and developing competencies, which will help the organization to respond to the new situation and adapt to changes. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze the competencies that the employees in the infrastructure industry in India require in order to face uncertainty. This study adopts a qualitative approach. A purposive sample consisting of 15 managers/leaders from 4 different companies in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India was taken. An in-depth interview was carried out with them. Data collected during interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed to find out the themes and competencies which are required to cope with the changing environment. In this research, the following four themes were identified, i.e. ‘Competence’, ’Empathy’,‘Adaptability’, and 'Innovation'. The results showed that to survive in this volatile business world, there was a need for employees to acquire “Competencies”,",18,194

Indian infrastructure,Syndication of VCPE investments: Evidence from the Indian infrastructure sector,"Syndication of VCPE investments: Evidence from the Indian infrastructure sector
We analyse syndication transactions in the Infrastructure Debt segment, one of the largest segments of Indian corporate debt market. The Infrastructure debt syndications are typically characterised by a large number of lenders. We show that syndicators are likely to syndicate their loans to a smaller set of banks. This is in part because the larger syndicated loans tend to be allocated to banks based on their relative performance – in terms of profitability and size. In the absence of such performance-based allocation, syndicator banks are more willing to share risk.
The analysis shows that there is a strong relationship between syndicability and the relative size of each bank. Smaller syndicating banks tend not to use the infrastructure syndicates for their larger loans, whereas the syndicing of smaller loans is more widespread. Our analysis also shows a positive link between the size and number (and hence, the number) of participating banks to the risk of synd: 101-",20,189

As the global economy is expected to contract for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, the infrastructure gap in the developing world continues to widen. The global infrastructure deficit stands at $90 trillion by 2030, according to the OECD, of which over 40% is in developing countries. While a large part of the shortfall is accounted for by a lack of funding, poor governance also plays a significant role. At the same time, infrastructure projects are increasingly seen as vehicles for development, and the importance of public-private-partnerships, especially in emerging markets, has grown substantially.

In addition, many states in different parts are trying to develop rural roads. In the past, the focus has largely been on the construction and expansion of roads in urban parts, while the rural areas have lagged behind in this. However, this has now changed.
Rural roads are an important link between urban areas and the rest of the countryside, but they are not developed as well as the urban roads, and in many parts there is no access to a road at all. As a result, a large proportion of transport is carried out by the informal sector, for example by using bicycles, rickshaws, bullock carts and trucks, which has a great impact on transport costs, safety and pollution.",25,187

Abstract
Financial health of highway projects is of great importance to both the investors (financial institutions, equity investors, etc) and the public authorities responsible for these projects. The financial health assessment of the projects can be conducted by using a number of methods, some of them are: traditional debt to equity ratio, debt coverage ratio, interest coverage, return on equity, and profitability ratio etc. However, all these methods have their own shortcomings. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive model is developed based on the stochastic simulation technique to assess the financial risks of a highway project. An example model of an investment based highway PPP project is used to analyse the effectiveness of this model by simulating the project for a period of fifteen years. Simulation results suggest that the developed model can help to predict and understand the various parameters that affect the overall performance of financial aspects of any highway based",31,185

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of information infrastructure on the performance (both output and quality) of 1,400 manufacturing firms in India. The paper finds that the presence of Internet, Intranet, and LAN/WAN at the firm-level is positively related to firms’ productivity. These findings support the argument that firms can improve their performance by making the best use of ICT infrastructure. This finding also has important policy implications for policymakers concerned with improving the use and application of infrastructure and ICT.",43,198
Indian infrastructure,Productivity and technical efficiency in Indian states' manufacturing: the role of infrastructure,"Productivity and technical efficiency in Indian states' manufacturing: the role of infrastructure, size and location
This paper examines the technical, physical and social infrastructure and productivity levels in the manufacturing sector in 28 Indian States in three different industrial classifications: large, medium and small. A non-parametric approach of data envelopment analysis is used to derive the production frontiers and measure the productivity of manufacturing establishments. The data covers the period between 1997-98 and 2001-02. We also use panel regression analysis to examine the effect of these infrastructure indicators and size of the establishment on the level of production. Finally, we estimate the total factor productivity, its components and decompose it into its labour and physical components. Our findings show that there has been a marked improvement and convergence in all the States, as evidenced by the significant improvements in total and labour productivity. Productivity gains were also found to be higher in large and medium sized firms and in those located in urban areas. Infrastructure, in particular, the physical infrastructure is found by our analysis, to have significantly",44,199

The world is becoming more complex with each passing day. And, it is getting more competitive with every new business that enters the market. The only way forward, to stay ahead of the pack and remain relevant, is to become more “agile”.
Agility is the capacity to move quickly and nimbly, and adapt and change. It is a core capability for businesses to thrive in their respective markets, which is only possible if their supply chains remain efficient, agile and flexible. However, supply chain agility is not possible unless a firm understands and manages the flow of information and goods across its entire supply and production chain.

Description
The paper presents evidence on the impact of infrastructure on productivity of agriculture in rural areas in India. It finds that infrastructure investment in irrigation and roads is associated with a substantial increase in output for both irrigated and non-irrigated crops, whereas electricity and transport infrastructure is not strongly associated. The results also show that the effects of irrigation infrastructure are particularly strong during times of low irrigation coverage in the past, and that roads have a stronger impact on output during dry-season agriculture.",49,181
Indian infrastructure,Identifying critical infrastructure sectors and their dependencies: An Indian scenario,"Identifying critical infrastructure sectors and their dependencies: An Indian scenario
Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to identify critical infrastructures, which are necessary for a country to function, and to determine their interdependencies in the Indian context. A methodology is proposed for determining the criticality of infrastructure, based on the availability of information in different sources. The paper proposes a framework to rank infrastructure based upon its critical level and importance in order to provide a basis for prioritizing infrastructure protection strategies.
Introduction:The need to secure the nation’s critical information infrastructure is now a national security imperative. Critical infrastructures are an integral and essential part of the national and global information and communication (IC) infrastructures. They are the life-support systems of our nation, without which our economy and social life can be crippled or stopped. These include power generation, telecommunications, transportation, health care, food and agriculture, law enforcement, financial institutions, etc. In the United States, critical national infrastructure was defined in 198",50,190

AbstractA study on the linkages between urban infrastructure development, transportation infrastructure and economic growth in a developing economy like India, is presented. A theoretical model has been constructed and econometric analyses have been conducted to examine the relationship between the three variables. The study period is 1990s - 2011 for which data from the national statistical office and the Planning Commission are used. It is established that infrastructure growth – in particular transport infrastructure -- is an important driver for economic performance in the Indian economy. Infrastructure spending has a positive impact on economic output. However, the impact of infrastructure spending on GDP growth rate in urban areas is negative in contrast to the positive effects in rural areas. In order to improve the economic efficiency of urban transport investments, there is a need to increase the share of road investments. This can be achieved by reducing non-tax revenues and increasing the efficiency): 7(201",51,183

This study presents the results of an empirical analysis of the VGF scheme implemented by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in the Indian state. The paper presents an overview of VGV scheme and the methodology used to evaluate the scheme. This study finds that the overall viability of these projects is positive with an average IRR of 18.6%. The analysis further finds positive and significant effect of public subsidy and private risk on the project viability while the negative and insignificant effect was observed for project size. These findings can be helpful in formulating policies related to project evaluation of similar schemes in other parts of India. ()

The authors examine the effects on competition in Indian electricity markets when transmission investment is increased, and the implications for efficiency and welfare when the transmission cost of generation and load is unbundled. They find that unbundleing transmission increases efficiency but reduces welfare, especially in regions with high-voltage transmission, where the cost advantage of load-serving entities over independent power producers in accessing the system is large. The authors find a significant welfare gain to unbinding if the unbonding cost is 1% of total cost, with gains to load from a lower cost system and to generators from access to new customers.",55,181
Indian infrastructure,"Human capital, infrastructure, and the productivity of Indian rice farmers","Human capital, infrastructure, and the productivity of Indian rice farmers: evidence from a field experiment
Abstract
We study how human capital and infrastructure investments affect the rice productivity in a developing country using a “natural experiment” in which rice growers have been provided different levels of infrastructure development. The experiment took place in rural India and was a randomized control (randomized by farm). The infrastructure provided was the installation of irrigation wells. We find that the irrigation infrastructure investment has a positive impact on productivity, which is statistically significant at a p-value of 5% with respect to the non-infrastructure group. This finding is robust to controlling for potential unobservable selection, heterogeneity, endogeneity, unmeasured confounding, reverse causality, omitted variable bias and a range of other econometric approaches. A similar finding has also been reported by the World Bank.

Indian infrastructure,Making India's coastal infrastructure climate-resilient: challenges and opportunities,"Making India's coastal infrastructure climate-resilient: challenges and opportunities
India has a vast coastline with about 7,500 km of beaches and 3,000 km long riverine system. This coast is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise.
As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates, coastal populations could be affected by sea level rise of at least 0.2 meters by 2040 and as high as 60.5 meters in 2100, while sea surface temperatures may rise by up to 1.1°C by the end of the century. These rising sea levels are predicted to inundate about one third of India’s landmass. In addition to sea water inundation, the coastal zone has high salinity and tidal fluctuations, which will affect the saliency and availability of groundwater, and the stability of soil and vegetation on land. As the sea rises, these effects",57,184

This research paper analyses the relationship between the level of infrastructure development and agricultural productivity and its impact on agricultural investment by households. A theoretical framework is constructed by incorporating the concept of investment complementarity and the role of public infrastructure investment and credit. The results indicate that the availability of better infrastructure significantly increases the agricultural production by 2.4 times. Furthermore, agricultural credit also has a positive influence on productivity. These results suggest that investment on infrastructure is an important determinant of productivity in the Indian.

For the growth, and economic development, investment in infrastructure and other sectors is very important. The infrastructure sector is an important sector for growth and it has to be given importance in order to achieve sustainable growth in economy.
Infrastructure in India:
Indian Economy has grown very fast in last 3-4 decades. This fast growth has created the need for more infrastructure. According to the estimates, India needs to invest US$ 1 trillion in next 15 years. There are various reasons for this huge requirement of investment. First it is because the country needs more energy and this energy will be generated through infrastructure development. Second is that the infrastructure should be able to cater to rising demand in services like transport, health, education etc. Third, it needs a large investment",60,200

Review on infrastructure sector in the country – II :
The Indian infrastructure and development sector has grown exponentially over the years as a result of various factors. Some of the important factors are: the government’s focus on the development of this sector and making it a priority for the economic development. The other factor is the increasing need to make India a global manufacturing hub by the corporate giants, who would then invest in manufacturing sector which, in turn, would result in more demand for energy and other utilities, which in a way would help in making India more self-dependent, thereby, reducing dependency on imported products.
However, the Indian government has always been criticised for not giving enough attention to the infrastructure in rural India. Even though the rural economy is more productive, there has been a very low investment from the private sector, mainly in this area. This sector is also facing a number of problems like lack of",61,188

Abstract
The paper argues that while infrastructure has long been viewed as a key determinant of economic performance, its role in the contemporary world is more complex. The recent turn to financial markets to finance infrastructure projects has resulted in a proliferation of new financial instruments such as Public Private Partnerships, Public-Private Partnership Bonds, Social Investment Bonds and Special Purpose Entities. These new financing mechanisms and financial intermediaries such the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank have been used to attract public funds and mobilize private investment through the use of innovative financial structures. However, these new mechanisms have not been accompanied with the political reforms which would allow for the development of a public infrastructure market. This paper explores the implications of this turn, focusing specifically on three countries: India, Kenya and Colombia. It draws on case studies to explore the ways in which the financial turn has affected the politics of infrastructure and public debt. While financial",62,192

AbstractWe investigate the impact of physical and human infrastructure, along with other factors, on the output and productivity of manufacturing units. We find that both the physical infrastructure and the human capital are important drivers of firm performance. The findings of this study also suggest that there is some positive correlation between human and physical capital. It is observed that the efficiency of a firm is positively affected by human (managerial) capital and negatively affected: 1013-1015

To accomplish this purpose, this study uses data on regional disparities in per capita income for the period 1974-74 to 2011-12 at the state level for 25 Indian - states. Based on this data, the empirical findings of this paper demonstrate that, on the average, a 20 percent increase in public investment in infrastructure – per unit of GDP -- at state-level in one year raises the per capital incomes of states by 1.2-0.9 percentage points in the following years. This result is robust to several sensitivity tests. In fact, in a regression analysis where the level of per capita income in 1980 is used as a control variable, public capital investments are shown to increase per-capita regional income by almost four times over the long-term period. These results suggest",66,200

Dairy farmers are facing difficulties in getting quality inputs and are unable to take advantage of the increasing demand for milk and dairy products. In addition, the government has been focusing on infrastructure and resource development in the dairy value chain, but this investment has not been able to benefit the small-scale dairy farmers, who constitute about 85 percent of India’s dairy farmer population. To address these issues, a new project funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was launched to assess the resource, infrastructure, and skill gaps in Indian’ s dairy supply chain and provide recommendations to enhance the productivity and efficiency of dairy in smallholder and medium-sized dairy farms, especially in rural areas.

Abstract
Delhi and Mumbai, the two largest cities in the Indian sub-continent, have recently undertaken ambitious programs of building rail-based urban infrastructure. While Delhi has a legacy of urban railway development, Mumbai’s rail system is being built from scratch, and the city is in many ways a “laboratory” for Indian rail development. In this article, I use the concept of'metro' as an interpretative lens and an urban transport infrastructure as a site of contestation to examine what the railways mean for contemporary urban development in each city. The article traces the development of metro systems in these cities from their initial planning and building through to their current status. It shows how these metros are used by the cities’ residents, their changing meanings and uses, how the political uses of public transport change and shift as the systems develop, as well as how they are represented in contemporary",71,196

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of investments in transport infrastructure and regional roads on regional development using a dynamic panel data model. We find that investments into regional transport have a significant impact, while investments from the state budget have only a weak effect. Investments into the construction of roads have the highest effect on both the growth of per capita GDP and employment. This suggests that road investments have an important multiplier effect, but this effect is smaller than the effect of railway investments.",72,193

Rural India faces a wide range of health issues that are not adequately addressed. A large population of rural India is affected, with a disproportionate share of burden on women and children, and the poor. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the public healthcare system in the country is inadequate and uneven. In this thesis, I use the data of the NFHS-5 (National family Health Survey) to analyze the variations and trends across states & district in public health infrastructure. The analysis includes the availability and coverage of public hospitals, public primary healthcare centres / subcentres, dispensaries, health camps, community health centres, maternity homes, child health clinics, blood banks, eye clinics [with cataract removal facility], and health personnel. These health facilities play an important role in delivering health care to the most vulnerable populations. I find that there have been considerable improvements in availability",75,196

Our approach is based on using the state level panel data of annual time series data from the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) for the period 1 January 1991 - 31 December 2017 of which 22 years are available for analysis. We use a set of production functions based mainly on the theory of technical change to analyse the long term trends in the productivity of these systems. For this, we use the Hodrick-Prescott filter to decompose the annual growth rate of per capita GDP into the components of aggregate productivity and its components in terms of labour and capital.

This paper investigates the health infrastructure and immunization service delivery in 17 states of India in the year 2015-16. We use a unique, comprehensive, and nationally representative survey (National Family Health Survey-four, NFCS-IV) to analyze the coverage of various immunization services, access to public hospitals with emergency services and the quality of public health facilities in these rural regions. In the analysis, we also control for the state of health and demographic characteristics of people to capture the heterogeneity of the region within India and to isolate the impact of these facilities from the other determinants. The key findings are that the states with low human capital and poor demographic outcomes have low coverage and quality in terms of immunization programs. Also the access, quality and cost of care in public sector hospitals is better in states which have high human development. Thus health service infrastructure is a critical determinant of coverage, accessibility and health outcomes",79,191

I examine two dimensions of the productivity of an input, that is, labour and capital, and find that the infrastructurals are very important inputs for manufacturing units. A unit which has better infrastructuring has higher labour as well as capital productivity. This paper also highlights the need for infrastructuration at the level of a particular unit, in order to achieve higher productivity, by looking at different types of input use, for example, electricity, telephone, computer, etc in manufacturing plants.: 2003-04

Indian infrastructure,Critical evaluation of road infrastructure in India: a crosscountry view,"Critical evaluation of road infrastructure in India: a crosscountry view
This paper examines the status of infrastructure for urban areas in five developing economies: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Thailand. In doing so, it seeks to provide a critical overview of the state of urban infrastructure, particularly with respect to road systems. It finds that there are important differences between countries in their infrastructure performance and that a country’s performance in the infrastructure sector is not a function of its economic size. The findings are used to draw attention to key policy implications for both urban and infrastructure development.

Indian infrastructure,Role of Japanese official development assistance in enhancing infrastructure development in India,"Role of Japanese official development assistance in enhancing infrastructure development in India
Abstract: Japan’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) has played an important role in providing technical support for building infrastructure in developing countries. In the past decade, Japan has been providing a lot of assistance to developing Asia to build infrastructure. The paper examines the role of Japan in the infrastructure sector of India from the perspective of technical cooperation and capacity building. It examines whether the Japanese assistance has helped India in building a strong institutional framework for planning, financing, and operating infrastructure projects. Further, the study also examines what role Japanese aid has had in helping India to overcome the problems in implementing PPP model of infrastructure finance.

Indian infrastructure,Rural infrastructure and agricultural output linkages: A study of 256 Indian districts,"Rural infrastructure and agricultural output linkages: A study of 256 Indian districts
The objective of the paper is to estimate the impact of rural infrastructure on agricultural production. A system of equations is estimated by using the farm household survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) during 1985-86 and 1999-00. The system uses two measures of infrastructural access: physical infrastructure measured by distance to main market and secondary market, and social infrastructure as distance from a hospital or a school. It also uses agricultural and non-agricultural inputs and outputs to the agricultural sector. Results indicate a positive and significant long-run relationship between agricultural inputs, outputs and physical and especially social infrastructur, while non farm inputs are found to have a negative impact.

It has also approved 25 percent FII investment in construction of roads, 20 percent in highways and 15 per cent in other roads,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari told reporters here. The Cabinet also agreed that the limit would be increased to the extent of any shortfall in FPI investment, he said, adding the decision will give a fillip to infrastructure development and will be a major boost to economic growth. “There has been a tremendous increase in demand for infrastructure.

Indian infrastructure,The impact of regional infrastructure investment in India,"The impact of regional infrastructure investment in India: Evidence from the power sector
This study examines the impact that regional power infrastructure investments have had on growth and other outcomes in Indian states. It focuses on the investments in grid and non-grid infrastructure, as well as on their impact on electricity consumption, agricultural growth, and poverty. The results show that infrastructure spending has a positive effect on per household electricity demand. Infrastructure investments also have a strong impact in terms of their multiplier effect, both in the electricity sector, which is the focus of the analysis, but also on agricultural productivity and rural poverty reduction. These results are consistent with the notion that electricity generation, in turn, leads to the creation of productive uses of labour and thus increases economic activity.
The study concludes that investment on energy infrastructure can improve the living standards of people in rural areas, while generating employment in urban areas. This has been achieved by a significant increase in agricultural output and a decline in poverty levels. Overall, the benefits of these investments outweigh the costs, even if one considers",85,200
Indian infrastructure,Municipal wastewater management in India,"Municipal wastewater management in India is a challenge to both the government and industry. India’s wastewater treatment capacity stands at an abysmal 8.5 percent. In an effort to meet the rising demands of wastewater and sewage management, India has adopted several technologies.
The Government of India launched its National Wastewater Management Programme (NWMP) in 1999, aimed at treating wastewater from all sectors. The NWMP was later renamed the National Urban Waste Water Management Mission in April 2006. However, even the NWMM has not yet been completely successful in treating all wastewater. As a result, a lot of untreated wastewater ends up being released into the river systems of the country. Some of this water also ends in the sea, polluting it. This is one of several factors that has led to the increasing incidence of water-borne diseases. According to a government report, waterborne illnesses kill 2.7 million Indians every year.

AbstractThis paper examines the relationship between economic development and growth of urban poverty using a panel data for Visakhaapatriam, an industrially developed coastal city in Andhra Pradesh. The study employs the panel probit model to analyse the determinants of poverty. We have found that the urban poor in the city are not able to cope with the economic changes taking place in Visakaatami. There are some important lessons which could be drawn for the planners of the developing countries in Asia, Africa and South Pacific. It is important for planners to take the following aspects into account: (i) to ensure employment opportunities to the rural population in order to prevent migration to industrial cities, 1999 with number 1069.

A panel data set consisting of 36 Indian cities from 1995 to 2010 is used to examine the impact of physical infrastructure, economic infrastructure and social infrastructure on city competiveness using the gravity model. It was found that economic and physical infrastructures play a significant role in improving state and intercity competitiveness whereas social and economic infrastructures do not have a strong impact. Furthermore, inter-city and intra-state competition is also found to have an impact on urban competitiveness of the cities.

Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to identify the investment patterns of PE (private equity) and VC [venture capital] – two important players of infrastructure development, in India. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 20 PE/VC funds was randomly drawn out of which 14 were taken for analysis. The sample comprises of all funds which are operating in infrastructure. A detailed survey was conducted with fund managers and other key persons to collect data and information from them. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS 22 software. Findings: It was found that PE and venture capital investors are investing heavily in transportation and energy, water and waste sectors, but have very little exposure towards the infrastructure sectors. Research limitations/implications: Since the study covers the period 2008 and 2016, the data on investment trends might not be representative of current scenario, especially with respect to the",100,187

The Indian government's efforts to increase educational opportunities for its poor rural population by providing infrastructure to primary schools have not always met with success. The government has been unable to provide infrastructure for all eligible schools. We show that the lack of infrastructure at schools in India has an adverse effect on enrolment, especially for girls. In particular, the likelihood of a girl attending school is negatively affected when the number of students in a school exceeds 25, while the probability of attending for boys is higher for larger classes. Our results are robust to different measures of class size and school infrastructure. Moreover, we document a positive correlation between the enrol.

Abstract
This dissertation empirically investigates the causal effects of infrastructural development on poverty in India. Using a unique panel data set of 1,000 Indian states, over the period 1993 to 2010, I investigate the effect of various types of infrastructure and their combination with the level of poverty on household consumption and expenditure. I find that infrastructurally developed states have lower poverty rates than the infrastructually underdeveloped states. This suggests that poverty can be reduced by developing infrastructure. Infrastructure, particularly roads, has a significant positive effect on income generation and hence has an impact on the poverty level. The results also indicate that the impact of road infrastructure is stronger than that of irrigation infrastructure in reducing poverty. However, the results show that irrigation and power infrastructures do not have any significant impact. In addition, while there are significant gender differences in the effects,",104,194

Abstract
India’s cities, the largest cities being in the metropolitan regions, are home to nearly 30% of its population. The recent rapid growth of urban infrastructure has been instrumental for the economic progress of these regions. In this paper, we empirically assess the impact of infrastructure spending on population density for 27 major cities of the country. A panel data approach was adopted for this study and the results reveal significant positive association between the level of spending and density of population in cities. We also find a positive relationship between density and other parameters like population, per capita income, literacy, and health expenditure. However, there exists an insignificant association at the national level. This study contributes to the understanding of spatial structure of Indian urban areas and provides policy implications for further infrastructure growth in order to promote sustainable development.

Abstract
This study is based on the PPP model in India, and particularly on how this model has been applied in the Bangalore region. The main reason why PPP has become a popular method for infrastructure financing, is its flexibility and its ability to be customised and adjusted to the needs of each infrastructure sector. PPP is not a financing option in itself. It is rather the use of different financial instruments to provide a long-term loan in order to finance large infrastructure projects. In this case, public and private investors collaborate in a partnership to build, own, operate and maintain (BOO) infrastructure assets. This thesis is focusing on Green Field Bangalore Airport PPP Project – a PPP project, which was awarded to Bangalore international Airport Company Limited (“BIAC”) in 2008, by the Government of India.",109,183

Infrastructure projects are being considered as one of the key drivers of Indian development and the private sector has been given a major role in infrastructure development in the country by means of Public Private Partnerships (PPP). However, the recent experience from India shows that PPP projects have been fraught with several issues and problems and in most cases the projects were not delivered on time, within budget and to specification. The present paper is an attempt to critically analyse some of these issues, and identify the reasons for them. In addition, it seeks to analyse the current legislative/legislative framework available in respect of BOD based infrastructure PPP in order to identify some gaps in this legal/institutional framework which are likely to cause problems during implementation of infrastructure project and also to suggest some measures/remedies to overcome those problems.

In India, public healthcare delivery has largely remained a government monopoly with private hospitals and clinics remaining a minority. In the last two decades, there has been an increase in private investment in healthcare services in the country. The private healthcare sector accounts for nearly 70% of India’s total public-private healthcare expenditure. However, in rural India where nearly two-thirds of the population resides, the private sector has failed to reach even the most rudimentary services and facilities. 1, 2.
As the public health sector is not meeting the health needs of a significant population of Indians, private providers are playing a vital role by providing services to the urban population. But they fail miserably in providing even basic services. A recent study has shown that 90 – 98% private doctors in Mumbai do not prescribe essential drugs.

Abstract
Infrastructure planning has become an urgent task for the Indian cities. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the current status of drinking water provision to households, and its implications for urban development and to explore possible policy options to improve it. To this end, the paper develops a mathematical framework to estimate the optimal capacity of a water distribution network for each city based on household densities, household size, water use, access to piped network and other factors. A simulation exercise with two scenarios shows that a network of 10 km radius with a pumping capacity to cover the entire city can be sufficient to meet the drinking needs of the city, if the household sizes of all cities can shrink from the average of their current sizes to 2.5",126,185
Indian infrastructure,Political economy of infrastructure spending in India,"Political economy of infrastructure spending in India: A political economy perspective
Abstract
Infrastructure is the backbone of the Indian economy as it provides a wide platform for growth of various economic sectors. There is a strong consensus that the infrastructure development in the country has been lagging behind in comparison to the global scenario. It is observed that there has not been much investment in infrastructure, in spite of high growth rate witnessed in recent years. In this context a detailed analysis of Indian infrastructure sector has become necessary. This paper is an attempt to study the political factors behind India’s infrastructural development. The analysis reveals that political factor is one of major factors influencing the growth in infrastructurals in Indian scenario; however, the extent of political influence varies with infrastructure type and its sub-type. Infrastructure sector is found more sensitive to political changes in power and political parties have been using infrastructure for gaining political mileage.

Abstract
The present study was undertaken to identify and explore the gaps in health infrastructure in our country – “India”. The study revealed that there is a wide variation in the availability of various facilities among different states in India. The availability in various states are: Primary health centre (PHC) is available in all states, 50% of the total states have sub-centre available, and 33% states has a dispensary available. Among tertiary health care facilities, hospitals are available at a rate of 80% in some states. In terms of doctors, the study shows a significant gap between the number needed and doctors available for a state. For all the states combined it shows that the required doctors are 8.7 times as much as that currently available - 1.3 lakhs in 2011 as compared to 16,100 in actual available number of physicians [2010-11].

The public expenditure of India is divided into four categories: Revenue expenditure, Capital expenditure and Transfers and subsidies, Interest expenditure including debt amortization, and Contingency. It accounts for nearly 70 percent of the GDP. The government spends a major part of its revenues on Interest payment and Debt servicing. This is because of a very large public debt, which is about 60 percent - 65 percent. Of the 5 percent, 3.6 percent is the share of Debt service.
Interest Payment and debt servicing have grown by 4 percent and 8 percent respectively every year. Debt and Interest payments constitute an average of 15 percent share in the total budgetary allocation of all Ministries. 20 percent budget is earmarked for Interest Payment. In 1993, Debt Service and interest payments together accounted for less than 2 percent expenditure. As the economy has grown and the government has increased the amount spent on interest payment",129,192

The public-private partnership (PPP) model, a form of contractual arrangement for the delivery of infrastructure services through the private sector is increasingly used to finance infrastructure in developing countries. Despite its popularity, there is limited empirical evidence on the performance of PPPs in terms of their ability to deliver high-quality infrastructure and services and achieve development goals. A review of existing studies indicates that the PPP model has not always delivered the promised outcomes of highquality infrastructures, reduced costs, enhanced efficiency, and increased service availability. This study aims to identify the factors that may be constraining the ability of the public and private sectors to achieve these objectives through PPP in the context of India. The study examines the nature and causes of disputes in PPP agreements, their impact on PPP outcomes, the role of dispute settlement procedures in reducing the impact of these disputes and its effect on outcomes.

The Government's push towards infrastructure development is well known by now. The focus has been not only on infrastructure sectors such as highways, railways, ports and urban development, but also on sectors like airports, power, telecom and oil & gas. In 2007-08, the overall outlay on the physical infrastructure was Rs 3.2 lakh crore, with public sector share amounting to 50 per cent.
Given the critical nature of infrastructure, its development has also been given top priority by several countries in the world. As a result, in a relatively long period, countries have made significant progress in this regard. There are many factors to these achievements, including a large public expenditure, high levels of investment from both public and private sectors and the availability of adequate technical manpower. However, a common feature of all infrastructure-led development models is the need to have a supportive framework, and a policy and administrative system that",132,194

The second five-year plan of the Indian government (1992-97) called for “massive” infrastructure development, including construction of 100 new airports and 10,000 more kilometres of highways, and the laying of new pipelines for transporting petroleum products and natural gases.
Despite the government’s lofty plans, the country’ s infrastructure is in poor condition, particularly with respect to power, roads and irrigation. The World Bank has warned that India’slarge infrastructure deficit is a threat to the economic and social development ofthe country. In its most recent review of India in December 1998, it said, “…the current infrastructure investment level is not sufficient to sustain growth at even the relatively low levels that have been achieved in recent years.” It added that there was ""a need for substantial investment in the energy, telecommunications, transport",135,188

AbstractThe World Banks and the Asias Development Banks (ADB) 2005 Asian Urban Development Report [ADR] argues that the Asian urban crisis is rooted in the poor governance of urban services. It is the governments failure to invest in urban service provision that is at the heart of the problem - governments in Asia are not investing the necessary amounts in infrastructure, especially in cities. As such, it advocates increased investments in city infrastructure to support rapid and sustainable urban growth. This chapter explores how these institutions shape the urban agenda and support the reengineering of infrastructure and services in Asian cities through investments and policy.
The chapter is divided into four parts. In the Introduction, the role of international financial institutions 1 2 is examined. Part two explores the relationship that exists between the two institutions: ADB, in its various incarnations 3 4 5 6 and World 7 Bank",139,187

Abstract
Smart city mission is an ambitious plan to transform Indian cities by using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and other digital technologies to improve city services. As of 2015, more than 40 Indian urban cities had been selected as smart city, and the list includes several Indian IT hubs. This paper presents an overview of some of the smart initiatives undertaken at different levels of city governance. We present an empirical analysis of a few selected smart projects in two smart Indian city-states: Kochi in Kerala and Bangalore in Karnataka. The analysis reveals that while the state government in both the cities is driving the process with its top down approaches, the city administration has become the primary implementer.",140,192

The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of private participation and PPP in the energy sector for five emerging countries (Egypt, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, and Thailand) and to identify common themes, issues, lessons learnt, success factors, etc. In the case study countries, there is a general lack of institutional framework for public-private partnership “PPP”. The lack is due to the absence of laws and regulations, lack or absence in government policies and guidelines and/or lack in political will, or due mainly to lack knowledge or experience.

AbstractThe study explores the economic significance of the new industrial policy of 1991-92 in India. It examines the impact of a new infrastructure policy on the location of new industries, particularly in the case of South Indian industrial zones. The paper also examines two new economic policy zones to explore the nature of infrastructure that is created to support industrial growth. These zones are identified and located on a map of India to highlight the extent to which new zones support the creation of industrial infrastructure. Finally, the role of hope and anticipation on location choices is examined. We show that anticipation is not a sufficient condition for location. This conclusion is based on evidence from the two zones examined in this study.",142,192

Abstract
The paper explores the distribution and accessibility of infrastructural and service-based amenities across the urban districts of India using a unique database of 2,200 urban local self governments. We find that the share of urban areas served by the government with the basic and infrastructure services increases with an increasing urban size. The urban population living more than one kilometer away from public transport, public health, education, and water supply facilities is significantly higher in the larger cities. Further, we find an increase, rather than decrease, in inequality in service delivery across districts. Our results provide empirical support for the argument that local governments should be allowed to expand and provide more services to the population of their jurisdiction in a more decentralized and devolved environment, thereby reducing inequality.",143,195

Abstract
In spite of the fact that the development and growth of a region depend on various factors such as geographical location, natural resources, availability of human resources and infrastructure, the region with better infrastructure tends to attract more investments leading to rapid economic and industrial growth. Hence, it has been observed that there is a positive and significant correlation between infrastructure development in a country and economic development, with the former being the driving force behind economic progress. The present study aims at identifying and explaining the impact of infrastructure on poverty, in Indian states. It uses a time series data for the period 2000–2014, collected from the official statistics of government sources and other reliable secondary sources. We employ both ordinary and structural causality tests to test the hypothesised relationship. Our results indicate that economic infrastructure has a significant impact on regional poverty in India, while the causation from poverty to infrastructure is also significant",146,185

AbstractThe study assesses and compares the physical and financial infrastructure of government versus non-government aided primary (1- 7) and upper primary( 8-12) schools under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan - a central government school education reform programme initiated in 2000. A sample of 1,000 schools is covered from five states. Data is collected by means of a specially designed school questionnaire and by using an asset index for each school. This paper assess the impact of public school expansion on access to education for poor children in the five selected States. The study finds that private aided schools have much better physical facilities, including more teachers and more textbooks. They also charge higher tuition fees and the quality of education appears to be higher. It is also found that the cost structure of private schools makes them vulnerable to fluctuations in their financial inflows. Finally, it is argued here that, despite the higher quality and lower costs of the private sector",148,198

We investigate the effect of the implementation of biometric identity smart cards on labor market participation, welfare, and program performance. We find that participation in the public employment guarantee and rural health insurance schemes increases after the introduction of smartcard technology. Labor market participants also receive benefits from increased labor force participation: the smart card is associated with higher wages and longer working hours. The impact on welfare is ambiguous. Our results also confirm that smartcarts help program participants to avoid the leakages that characterize public schemes. These results suggest that the Indian government can improve the effectiveness of existing programs by replacing the existing payment infrastructure with the new smart)

This study investigates how the impact on income inequality of public provision of basic infrastructure (schools, roads, and irrigation) may vary across states in India and between rich and poor households. Using a panel data set, the study analyses the effect of these public interventions on the distribution of income among rural households in a sample of Indian states and among households of different wealth groups over the period 1973–2000. The results show that, although the overall distribution has become more unequal, provision and investment in basic public infrastructure have reduced inequality among rich households, but not among poor ones. Public infrastructure investments have been more beneficial to poor people in states with high levels of per capita income in the pre-reforms era. In contrast, there is no impact at all on poor families in high-performing states.

The government needs to invest more in irrigation and improve the efficiency of its use.
In India, the use of irrigation has increased from 60% in 1980 to 80-90% currently. This is due to better technology (e.g. water pumps, drip irrigation, etc) as well as government interventions – irrigation subsidies and free electricity to farmers. As farmers continue to migrate to cities and the country’s population grows, this increase is bound to continue. The government’ water resources department estimates India’ irrigation potential at a whopping 600,000 km and its irrigation area at 160 million hectares [1].

AbstractThe paper attempts to estimate the long-run relationship between public investment and GDP using panel data for India. Using annual data from 1971 to 2008, the analysis indicates that the impact of the investment in infrastructure is not very different from investment spending in other sectors. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that a 1 percent increase in the ratio between the capital and the GDP is associated with a decline in real GDP of 0.7 percent. However, it may also be argued that an increase of capital spending of one unit increases GDP by about two units for every unit spent as an input in capital-intensive manufacturing industries.

The data are based on annual reports of railway companies, government surveys, official censuses, local gazetteers, land ownership registers, censorial records, court documents, railway timetables, passenger and freight tariffs and receipts, maps, correspondence, photographs, newspaper advertisements, architectural drawings, engineering drawings and reports, etc. Using panel data regressions of 1870-1945 and spatial econometrics for 1910, this paper finds strong positive associations between investment in transport infrastructure and GDP per capita growth across regions of all scales. This relationship is strongest in areas where the population was least mobile, where transport costs, especially in terms of time, were highest. It is not clear whether or not these associations are spurious. If they are not, transport may have been the key to British economic success",159,200

In this regard, the role of transport infrastructure is of paramount importance in any developing nation. The present study investigates the long-run relationship among the transport, industrial and energy variables. Using cointegration approach, a three-variable system is tested. Co-integration, vector error correction model and Granger causation test have been employed in order to investigate the causal relationship between the variables in short-term and long term. We find strong causal linkage between energy, transport and industrial variables for India. Moreover, we found a unidirectional causatory relationship from energy to industrial output and from industrial to transport output. This finding supports the hypothesis of Koop et al. (1992) and also the theory of endogenous growth which is the base for endogenous development theory. Further, it also",164,188
Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure and Human development in India: An Inter-state comparison,"Infrastructure and Human development in India: An Inter-state comparison
AbstractThis paper attempts to estimate infrastructure indicators for all the states and Union territories of India, for the period 1950-2006, using a system of national accounts. It is found that the growth in all infrastructure measures has been positive during the entire period considered. The average growth rate in 1998/99 to 2004/05 was 2.1 per cent. There has not been a consistent pattern among the regions of the country. All the measures are significantly related to the human development indicators such as literacy and infant mortality rates, and there are significant differences in the levels of human resources development for different regions. We conclude that there has, on an all-India basis, been consistent growth during 1947/48 to: 1 (2007)

Indian infrastructure,"Infrastructure, ICT and firms' productivity and efficiency: an application to the Indian manufacturing","Infrastructure, ICT and firms' productivity and efficiency: an application to the Indian manufacturing sector
AbstractThe Indian economy is witnessing a rapid transformation. The transformation of the industrial sector from a labor-intensive one to a capital and technology intensive sector is underway. With this shift, the role of ICT has become important for the growth of industrial efficiency and productivity, and in reducing inefficiencies that arise from the fragmentation of physical infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a two-sector model and examine the effect of infrastructure and ICT on productivity in both the services and manufacturing sectors. Using the data of manufacturing and services sectors for years 1998-2000, for a panel of 30 industrial clusters and a control group of non-industrial clusters, our results show that the productivity growth in manufacturing is positively associated with the development of road and power infrastructure in the manufacturing clusters whereas, in case of services sector, both infrastructure development and use of technology increases the level of productivity. We find that ICT infrastructure",170,183

This paper provides an empirical assessment of the impact of investment in infrastructure on economic growth in the countries of Europe. The study is based on the theoretical arguments on which the European Union’s Structural Funds are based. It uses a set of econometric models to test the effect of capital accumulation on GDP growth. Empirical evidence for this purpose is extracted from 18 European countries for the period 1970-1997, with the aim of investigating the relationship between growth and investment. An empirical investigation of this relationship is carried out by means of a system of panel cointegration and vector error correlation models with structural breaks. This is a challenging task because the empirical literature on structural change has been largely neglected. Results reveal the existence of an inverse relationship in all countries studied between total infrastructure capital stock and GDP. These empirical results are robust, even after controlling for various macro-economic variables, and can be explained by a combination of two mechanisms: direct and indirect ones. In",172,199

Solid Waste Management
The Indian government does not have a comprehensive policy for solid and hazardous waste. It does have several programs in place to help improve its situation, such as the Integrated Solid Waste Treatment Project (ISWTP). This program focuses on improving waste collection, recycling, composting, and the management of landfills. India is also working to improve waste education. For example, in 2008, India opened India' s first waste-to-energy plant in the city of Hyderabad.[1]
Infrastructure
There are a large number of informal waste workers, including garbage pickers, ragpickers and rummagers.[2] There are also several waste processing and treatment facilities in various states across India.[3",173,198
Indian infrastructure,Improving access to water supply and sanitation in urban India: microfinance for water and sanitation infrastructure development,"Improving access to water supply and sanitation in urban India: microfinance for water and sanitation infrastructure development
The study examines the extent to which access has been improved through microcredit in selected districts. The study focuses on the provision of access by private companies and households to the water sector. It examines whether the poor have been helped and whether access is sustainable. Access to safe water has increased in all districts except two. Water quality has improved and the number of users has grown in most cases. Private companies have played an important role in providing access for some groups, especially the urban poor. However, in other places, the state, NGOs and community organizations have provided a larger proportion of the infrastructure. This shows that there has not been a clear shift towards the private sector in the sector as a whole. Households have benefited from microcredits in terms of increased access, improved sanitation levels and improved quality of water. There are a number factors that explain why the results of micro credits do not translate into access.",174,188

Abstract. This paper examines district-wise variations, and district specific factors, in terms of childhood vaccine coverage and immunization rates. The paper focuses on district level data covering 2001 and 2011. We use a probit model to study the effects of district and community level characteristics on the coverage of vaccines. A set of explanatory factors such as community and individual socio economic status (SES), health care availability, health awareness, literacy, caste, distance, sex of child, number of years since last birth are incorporated into the model.
This study is unique in two ways. First, it provides detailed district – level estimates of immunization coverage rates by combining survey data at a disaggregate level. Second, the paper investigates the determinants of vaccine uptake at the district/community level and examines the effect of the health related infrastruct",176,188

Abstract
Infrastructure provision is one of the most important determinants of poverty reduction. This study investigates the impact on rural-urban inequality of two different types of infrastructures in rural India during the last two decades. Our main focus is on electricity, irrigation, roads and transport. In rural areas, we find a positive and significant relationship between the number of electrification projects and inequality. A negative and insignificant link with the rural–urban distribution of irrigation projects was found. On the contrary, road and rail projects were negatively related to inequality at the village level. The main explanation for this is that roads are more likely to benefit the better-connected rural households in more developed states, whereas railways benefit all rural residents, including those who live in less developed areas.",178,181

Indian infrastructure,Profitability determinants of infrastructure public private partnerships (PPPs): empirical evidence from Indian data,"Profitability determinants of infrastructure public private partnerships (PPPs): empirical evidence from Indian data
Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the profitability determinants in infrastructure Public Private Partnerships (‘PPP’) projects in India. We use data from a survey covering 120 such projects. Based on the survey data and using a two-step least squares technique, the paper identifies and tests the determinants which are most likely to explain the variation in the return on investment. The paper finds that profitability of projects is negatively related to the share of debt in project capitalisation. Further, projects with higher capital investment have higher profitability than those with lower capital investments. This suggests that a project’s capital intensity determines its profitability. It is also found that the project profitability is higher when the projects are implemented with the participation of the State government or when it is a ‘build and transfer’ project as in comparison with 'build, own and operate’ projects or PPPs involving only a long term lease. Moreover, project size and project duration have significant negative relationship with profitability as they are the drivers",184,199

Abstract:
This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of different bicycle friendliness features of the Indian bicycle infrastructure - on the bicyclist's choice to use the bicycle instead of other transport modes, on their level of bicycletrism and on health status, among the population in 2 cities of North India
The study shows that bicycle facilities are effective in increasing the number of people who use a bicycle to reach their destination and that such facilities also lead to a significant increase in the level and extent of cycling.
It also suggests that there is an association between bicycle-related health outcomes like the rate of cardiovascular diseases, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and type II diabetes. The study also shows an increase of 7-9% in health of non-obese adults and a 12% increase with obese",185,183

Indian infrastructure,Towards a comprehensive understanding of public private partnerships for infrastructure development,"Towards a comprehensive understanding of public private partnerships for infrastructure development in Sub-Saharan Africa
Public Private Partnership (P3s) are widely recognized as a key mechanism for financing and delivering infrastructure projects in low- and middle income countries. However, they have not had the desired effect in Africa. To date, only a small number of P3 projects have been successful. This is despite several countries, such as Ethiopia and Ghana, developing a robust legal and administrative framework to facilitate P2s. Despite this progress, many governments in sub-Sahara Africa are still reluctant to develop their own PPs.
This paper aims to provide a holistic view of PPPs by looking at PPS in the subSaharan region, from conception to implementation, with the aim of identifying the barriers to successful implementation. It provides a conceptual overview of the PPP framework, the role of private investors and financing institutions, and outlines the main legal, contractual, financial, operational, political and regulatory issues.

The Indian government has initiated the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model to address its infrastructure development needs. This paper analyses how governance mechanisms have been used to structure PPPs to facilitate their success and the relationship between the institutional and structural mechanisms and project performance. It examines the PPP arrangements in 13 large-scale road projects across India from 2000 to 2010. The study found that there was no direct relationship with the governance arrangements and their influence on project success; rather, the success of PPP projects depended on the quality of the contracts, project design, and government commitment and oversight. In addition, it found a relationship that is not expected with governance structure and contract structure, namely, that PPP infrastructure contracts are generally more complex and more expensive than non-PPPs. As such, government intervention and control over PPP contracts and projects are required and are the key to success in PPP): 4 ()

India has been one of the first few countries to be hit by COVID- 2019. It is also the third worst-hit country behind USA and Brazil. The number of people infected by the coronavirus in India is the highest in Asia after China and Japan. India’s response to the COVID outbreak has come under criticism for lack of preparation and infrastructure, as the country’ s healthcare is already under-funded and lacks the ability to deal with an epidemic.
In India most of our hospitals are run by private trusts and not by government or non-profit organizations.

AbstractThis paper provides a new measure of infrastructure development for the rural economy and examines its impact on the level and volatility of rural real GDP. We find that rural infrastructure investments are a significant source of aggregate real output growth and are more responsive than urban public infrastructure to the demand for goods and services that are typically consumed by rural households. Further, rural public investments have a stronger impact in stimulating rural income growth in comparison to public urban investments. Our results also show that investment in public rural physical infrastructure leads to a decrease in rural unemployment and the volatility and uncertainty of real rural incomes is lower with rural investment: 2

Abstract
This paper examines perceptions of local communities about development projects in the vicinity of Arunta (Tibet), the headquarters of Changsa in Tawang District, Arunchal state. It also investigates if these perceptions differ depending on whether communities are members of the dominant Aruna tribe, the indigenous Gaddi tribe or the Bodo tribe. We argue that the nature of perceptions differs for communities that are differentially located on the same land. Using 24 in-depth interviews of people from all three communities, as well as 11 focus group discussions, we found that communities differed in their attitudes depending whether or not members were from the Arna tribe; Arunas are more likely to be supportive of infrastructure. This is because the project has direct benefits for the community. In contrast, Gadis and Bodos are less supportive and more opposed to the development. However, Bodes are also likely beneficiaries of this infrastructure as a",198,190
Indian infrastructure,How infrastructure agencies motivate staff: canal irrigation in India and the Republic of Korea,"How infrastructure agencies motivate staff: canal irrigation in India and the Republic of Korea compared
AbstractThis paper investigates the effect of pay, promotions and transfers on motivation to work in irrigation departments in the two countries. For this purpose, a comparative approach is adopted in which data from the South Asia and East Asia Survey of Public Service Motivation (2007–08), which includes a survey of 1,700 civil servants in Korea and India, are used. The findings show that the level of public service motivation varies between the agencies. In contrast to the public sector, the motivation of Indian irrigation staff appears to depend much more on their own initiative, and is therefore less affected by the motivational level in their department, which in turn is affected negatively by promotions. Korean irrigation department staff are more likely to be motivated by their pay and to have been transferred to another agency than Indian staff in a similar category. This suggests that in Korean public organisations, there is less of a tendency to promote staff within their agency, whereas in Indian organisations the",199,191

The study uses a two-step methodology which includes first estimating the growth function using the Hodrick-Prescott – filter and second estimating a vector error corrected model using a co-integration technique. We also include additional infrastructure measures in addition to the traditional ones of road density and road per 1000 km of roads. In order to test the robustness of the results, we also employ alternative growth functions - the ARDL approach and the Granger causality approach.

Abstract
In India, the urban sector suffers from several challenges, including low tax collection, poor governance and low service delivery. In spite of the importance of municipal reforms for the improvement of urban service provision, it remains a neglected area of research. I address this gap through a study of ‘Municipal Financial Accountability Act’, 1970, one of India’s most important laws for urban financing. The study examines how the provisions of this law are implemented at different levels of government, particularly the financial accountability provisions. Using field research, I explore the role of elected local government officials in implementing the law at the local level and assess the impact of these provisions on the delivery of service at both the state and local governance levels. Based on this research I argue that while the legal provisions for municipal financial reporting and accountability are important for ensuring fiscal transparency and",204,190

Indian infrastructure,Investigating causality between transport infrastructure and urbanization: A state-level study of India (19912011),"Investigating causality between transport infrastructure and urbanization: A state-level study of India (19912011)
Abstract : This paper attempts to investigate the linkages between urban infrastructure, transport network & urban development through a state level panel regression framework for a sample of 27 states of Indias. The analysis is done through 2 steps. First, a set of indicators for transport, infrastructure ; urbanisation. 3, and demographic 1 4 characteristics of the states for the period have been used. Next, the regression model has been estimated and the results suggest that there is a significant positive effect of urban transport and infrastructure on urban density. It is observed that the effects of these two variables are more pronounced on the growth of cities in India.

Infrastructure projects have a high tendency of time delay due to various reasons. In this study, we analyze the time overrun and its various dimensions in 25 mega infrastructural projects. Our analysis is based on a data of 3,200 mega projects undertaken over a period of more than 50 years since 1961. The findings suggest that there is a wide range of delay in infrastructure delivery across various mega-projects and the projects with higher delay also tend to cost more and vice-versa. We found that the cost over-run is directly proportional to the delay. Further, the analysis suggests that project size, project complexity as well as project location and climate are important factors for project cost and time-overrun.

AbstractThis paper investigates the long-run relationship among infrastructure investment, FDI inflows and GDP growth in the Indian economy. We use AR(p) and ARIMA models to analyse the time series properties of GDP, investment in road, rail and air transport, and FDIR (foreign direct inflow). We find evidence against the null hypothesis of long run cointegration of these variables. The result implies that infrastructure development, in turn, enhances economic development and foreign investment. However, the effect of foreign influsions on domestic investment is insignificant. Moreover, we test the significance of the causal relationship between investment-GDP and between FIRD and growth and find significant long term relation between the two, implying that foreign FIPs have a significant and positive impact on economic: 1257-1261

The Government of India, in 2006, introduced the concept of m-Government as part of its Digital India program to make public sector services more citizen-centric and accessible. This has been a key driver for the adoption of mobile services for government and has resulted in the development of an ICT-based platform, which provides a host of services to citizens. These services include payment of utility bills, filing of income tax, passport and other applications to government authorities, etc. The adoption has increased from 2.6 million in FY2013 to 8.5 million citizens in June 16. However, there is a wide gap between mGovernment adoption, and its usage and benefits to the citizens, especially in rural areas of the country.

Abstract
The financing of infrastructure is one of the main challenges facing governments, businesses and civil society. The traditional public funding model for infrastructure projects is being questioned by the global recession. A number of countries have started to use innovative financing methods such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), tolling and congestion charging, or user fees – such methods could be used to help finance infrastructure more cost effectively and reduce the fiscal pressure on public finances. At the same time, new financial products, such those developed by international financial institutions, are being used by governments to finance projects. These new tools are often based on market instruments and private participation. This paper reviews current approaches to the financing and funding of urban transport infrastructure, the role of PPPs for public transport, and recent trends in financing infrastructure through tolls, congestion pricing and user: 1-8

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure development and economic growth: Prospects and perspective,"Infrastructure development and economic growth: Prospects and perspective from India
In this paper we discuss how infrastructure development affects the growth of an economy using an augmented Solow (1987) productivity growth model. We consider the effects of three important dimensions of infrastructure - physical, human-related and institutional – as well as the interactions and feedbacks among them. The model is then applied to India, where the recent growth performance is very poor, with the GDP per capita growth rate declining in the 2000s. Results suggest that in order to achieve the average growth rates experienced by the Asian Tiger Economies during the past three decades, India would need to spend an additional 5.5 % of its GDP on infrastructural development.

Sanitation infrastructure is one of the key elements of human development. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether poor households’ choices affect sanitation levels and whether sanitation affects health. Using longitudinal data for a sample of 2000 households in three states of India, the paper first estimates the determinants of household access to sanitation. Household characteristics are then used to calculate the sanitation index. Next, household sanitation level is used as an exogenous determinant of a number of health outcomes. A set of econometric techniques are used and the results indicate that poor sanitation is associated with",220,195

The study analyses the role of decentralised governance for the financing and management of public infrastructure, especially for water supply, solid waste management, and urban transport. While some literature argues in favour of devolution of power to the local governments, the study shows the importance of a balance between local and state-level responsibilities as well. Furthermore, it highlights the crucial role that local self-governments play to improve service delivery and financial sustainability of their infrastructure and services. The study recommends a set of policy measures in the areas of fiscal devolved transfers, decentralisation of planning, financial management and human resources, as these are essential for strengthening local institutional frameworks for effective decentral.",222,200

The infrastructure-led growth models of countries such as Korea, Taiwan
and China have attracted the attention of many scholars and policymakers across the world.
This paper examines how infrastructure investment, measured both as economic and social investment and measured by public and private infrastructure, affects growth. In the context of a panel of 29 Indian States between 19962010,
we find that economic infrastructure has had a significant negative effect on
growth. Social infrastructure on the other hand has a positive but significant
effect on growth of Indian regions. The positive effect of social infrastructure
is more visible in regions with higher levels of literacy and lower level of
health infrastructure. This suggests that social investments are likely to be
more effective in generating growth than public infrastructure in India.",223,181

This paper analyzes the impact of road transport infrastructures on the economic performance of the country, using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The impact has been estimated through the simulation of alternative scenarios of future road infrastructure. We use the model to explore the impacts of increasing road investments on growth, employment, productivity, and energy consumption. Our findings suggest that improving road quality is crucial, especially for improving transport efficiency. This implies that investments in roads need to be made with more consideration paid to the quality-adjusted costs and benefits of investments. Moreover, the positive link between infrastructure investments and GDP indicates the importance of investing in new transport systems. ()

Indian infrastructure,Privacy at the margins| The poverty of privacy: Understanding privacy trade-offs from identity infrastructure users in India,"Privacy at the margins| The poverty of privacy: Understanding privacy trade-offs from identity infrastructure users in India
Abstract
Privacy is a key concern when designing information technology. However, most existing research on privacy tends to focus on the concerns of privileged users, who have a high degree of agency over their data. We argue that privacy is an important concern for those users with less agency — the poor or disadvantaged. The paper describes an ethnographic study of identity cards that we conducted in an urban poor settlement, where we observed the interactions between government officials, beneficiaries, and the card. In the course of our study we encountered a complex and nuanced relationship between the benefits of the identity card and its potential to erode privacy. Our paper is informed by these observations.

Indian infrastructure,Nonlinearity between infrastructure inequality and growth: Evidence from India,"Nonlinearity between infrastructure inequality and growth: Evidence from India
AbstractIndia is the 11th most unequal developed economy, and it is also an under-performing economy in terms of growth. The authors find that there are three sources of this underperformance. First is underinvestment in infrastructure. They show that the infrastructure investment gap, which is estimated as a ratio of infrastructure to GDP, explains about one-fourth of the growth gap between India and the average growth of advanced economies from 1960 to 2012. Second is an infrastructure quality gap which, they say, may explain as much as 25% of India's growth performance. Third, infrastructure is a significant impediment to the country'S potential for growth as measured by the output per capita. Overall, the authors' findings suggest that addressing India""s infrastructure gap should be a priority for policy makers to promote faster: 1

The study of the impacts of solar power projects on local societies and the environment is crucial to ensure a sustainable future for both. Yet, to date, research has largely failed to address the issue of power inequalities, which can be seen as the key driver behind the rapid development and expansion of renewable energy systems. In India, the state government has been implementing renewable projects across the country to meet the growing demand for electricity. Kerala is at the forefront of this development in the south, having installed more than 3,800 MW of grid solar in just over ten years. The expansion has led to a surge of new projects and a proliferation of land acquisition in order to access sufficient land for development. But the local communities are often not consulted and their views disregarded in planning. This paper investigates the social, environmental and economic impacts on communities in two different districts.

Indian infrastructure,Do governance quality and ICT infrastructure influence the tax revenue mobilisation? An empirical analysis for India,"Do governance quality and ICT infrastructure influence the tax revenue mobilisation? An empirical analysis for India
AbstractThe main objective of this paper is to study the impact of governance qualities and information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure on the performance of tax collection in the country of India. It is argued that the quality of political institutions is the key determinant of the overall tax performance. In particular, it is believed that a better and more responsive governance structure and stronger accountability are the main preconditions for successful tax mobilizations. The empirical tests show that in general, higher tax revenues are achieved by better quality political environment. On the other hand, ICT infrastructures seem to play a very important role in tax administration and collection systems of various countries. A significant and positive relationship between these variables is revealed by the study. Thus, we conclude from our empirical findings that ICT can play the crucial role by increasing the collection of revenues. We believe that our results can help the Indian Government for the effective and efficient collection and utilisation of public taxes. Copyright 2011): 3 ",235,196

AbstractThis paper empirically estimates total factor technical productivity of manufacturing industries in India during 1982-2013 at the aggregate level as well as at disaggregated level. Total factor technological efficiency has been estimated by means of Malmquist index and DEA-based Malinvaud index to assess the efficiency gains in manufacturing industry and also to measure the technical change of industries. The estimates suggest that the rate of change in technical intensity of the Indian industry is 3.7 percent per annum, which implies that technical progress is being made at a relatively fast rate in Indian industries with the exception of textiles and food processing industries where technological improvement is slower. We also find evidence of efficiency gain in the manufacturing sector as the Malvintus Malindu index of aggregate technical efficiencies is rising steadily. This is further confirmed by DEA analysis, as aggregate total technical technical (2015)

Abstract
Anthropogenic interventions on coastlines can have profound consequences on coastal dynamic processes, such as erosion and deposition rates, and beach volume variability. However, these consequences are difficult for researchers and policy-makers to evaluate and manage due to the complex interplay of processes in dynamic coastal systems. We developed a coupled 2D–3 D modelling approach to investigate the influence of a coastal protection structure on a complex coastal setting. Our approach integrates 24 years of bathymetry data and 12 years (<10m resolution) of high-resolution (>1m) topography data collected along the ~20 km long Goplpur coastline, India. The results suggest that the structure acts as a barrier, trapping waves and sediment along its northern flank during storm events, thereby increasing shoreline erosion in the area. At the same time, the southern end of the coast, without the protection wall, shows a high erosion",239,190

In India the electoral winner, the Indian National Congress (INC), and its allies, have a strong presence in a large number of districts. We use an original data set from the 2004 and 2014 elections which includes information on the location and composition of voters and of candidates. By comparing the spatial structure of the distribution of violence and votes, we show that the pattern of vote allocation to the INC in these states is not uniform and differs between elections, but also that it is more concentrated around the districts with higher INC support.

Indian infrastructure,Economic growth in South Asia: Role of infrastructure,"Economic growth in South Asia: Role of infrastructure
Infrastructure in developing economies has been found to have a strong positive relationship with growth. This paper examines the impact of the quality of transport infrastructure, and electricity generation capacity on the growth of per capita income in 12 South Asian countries using annual time series data. The paper first estimates the effects of different components of capital stocks on economic growth and then examines how much of these effects can be explained by infrastructure. A structural model is used to identify the relative importance of each component of growth-infrastructure and the other factors such as labour, land, human capital and capital. It is found that the infrastructure stock explains a significant portion of economic performance: on average 22 percent of annual real GDP growth over the last three decades can attributed to infrastructure and 14 percent to the stock of physical capital in the economy. These findings indicate that developing Asian economies can improve their growth performance through better infrastructure development.

As we know, that India is one of the most populated countries on this planet which has more than 1 billion people, which makes it a very difficult place to contain an outbreak as it’s very vast.
The government of India has taken many measures to combat the COVID- 19 outbreak, including a 21-day nation wide lock-down from 26th March to 17th May 2020. But the lock down has been lifted for some states like Gujarat, Delhi, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh on 20th April 2019. And now the government lifted the lockdown for whole of country on May, 4th. (Source)
However, the virus has spread in India and the numbers have been rising rapidly in the past 10-14 days. The government has decided that there will be no more lock downs. Instead they have decided on a phased unlocking of states and sectors. This phase",247,194

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructuring work: Building a state-wide hospital information infrastructure in India,"Infrastructuring work: Building a state-wide hospital information infrastructure in India
Abstract
In 2007, an Indian state government embarked on an ambitious plan to build a hospital data information system, which was to include patient records and diagnostic and therapeutic information for use across all health care settings in the state. This infrastructure would also include an electronic health record that would track each patient as he/she travels across multiple facilities. In this paper, I describe the development of this infrastructure through the lens of the Infrastrucuring concept (Crawford and Dourish, 2011), drawing on the results obtained through a 5 month ethnographic field study in this hospital and through in-depth interviews with informants. My goal is to understand the social, economic and cultural forces that drive health system reform and the ways in which the infrastructure that is created by these reforms affects and is affected by them. I find the process of building this health infrastructure to be both complex and multi-dimensional.",249,194
Indian infrastructure,Removing poverty and inequality in India: the role of infrastructure,"Removing poverty and inequality in India: the role of infrastructure
Abstract:The infrastructure development in rural India is an issue of great concern. The rural population is still facing a number of problems that include poor roads, lack of water supply, inadequate drainage systems and poor health services. In the present paper, we try to identify the impact of rural infrastructure on the level of poverty in villages. We estimate the relationship between the infrastructure and the income of families in 50 selected villages of Uttar Pradesh. Our findings suggest that rural households in these villages spend more time on income generating activities due to better road connectivity and improved health facilities.

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure and finance: Evidence from India's GQ highway network,"Infrastructure and finance: Evidence from India's GQ highway network
The Ganga Queen (GQ), India’s national highway connecting the capital of West Bengal - Kolkata and the eastern state of Jharkhand was built as a flagship project by the government as part of its ambitious National Highways Project to connect the country' s far east, and its southernmost tip in 2020. However, in the aftermath of the project' completion, the road network was unable to meet the expectations of users and has failed to achieve the level of traffic it is capable of supporting. To address the issue, this paper uses a large-scale survey of over 1000 households on the GQL and a road-network travel cost model to assess the role of road infrastructure in household travel decisions. A number of factors are found to be important determinants of household' choice of travel mode, which are also found in a previous survey.

This study examines the role that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has played in India’s industrial growth as well as in infrastructure investment. We argue that F.D.I. plays a key role in the growth process in that it is responsible for the transfer of technology, capital and management expertise. However, the extent of impact of capital inflows from FDR in investment decisions of the domestic firms, as measured by the capital-output ratio, is very limited. This is particularly true in case of infrastructure investments.

The study focuses on the role of physical infrastructure in development, using secondary data on 24 states of India. It examines the extent to which infrastructure investment is an important determinant of growth at state level. The analysis shows that states which invest more in physical infrastructures are likely to see higher rates of economic growth, but that the impact of infrastructure on economic development is not uniform across states, with some states being more responsive than others to infrastructure-induced growth. Further, the analysis reveals that infrastructure investments are more likely in states whose growth rates have been higher, indicating a ""catalytic"" effect. In the absence of a strong catalytic effect, investments in infrastructure are not sufficient to induce growth and that a higher level of investment would be required. ()

Introduction
There is a growing concern for the poor access of health care services to the people living under extremely poor conditions. The poor people are not able to access primary health facilities due to poor infrastructure, lack of human resources, inadequate supplies and poor referral mechanism. A poor health infrastructure can be defined as the “lack of adequate physical resources and human resource to provide adequate health services in a given population” [1]. The health system should be able not only to ensure health of all but also to promote healthy life – long and productive population. Health care facilities should not be restricted to hospital based services and should reach the community through primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. In this context health is defined in terms of physical, mental and social dimensions.Health should promote social justice. It is important to note that the health status of a community is not determined solely by the physical health",258,198

Rainbow metaphors are used frequently in the literature to describe the structure and dynamics of spatial information management systems. In India, the implementation of a national spatial database, called the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), is currently taking place. The implementation process has been characterized by many of the features that characterize the use of rainbow metaphors. We describe in this paper how we observed the metaphor in use during the process of NSDI implementation. Our observations of this system are based on the work of other authors on NDSIs, and on an analysis of documents that describe and describe implementation plans. As a result of our observations, we discuss a number of characteristics and processes that appear in NSSDI implementation that we describe as the rainbow characteristics of implementation, based primarily on work by Gatre and Gogte in their studies of national databases for water resources and rural development in Maharashtra, India.",262,182
Indian infrastructure,The overseas citizen of India and emigrant infrastructure: Tracing the deterritorializations of diaspora strategies,"The overseas citizen of India and emigrant infrastructure: Tracing the deterritorializations of diaspora strategies
By : Ramesh C. Vankayala
The concept of ‘diasporas’ in the international relations literature has evolved from a narrow conception of migrants who have left their country of origin to become “a community of people whose common characteristic [is that] they are dispersed and live in foreign countries.” 1 However, with the proliferation of transnational migration flows, the notion of the diaspora has expanded to incorporate a variety of migrant groups with different experiences, including migrant workers, students, tourists, and others.
With the rise in global migration, a new category of citizen has emerged, that of an overseas (or em) citizen, or overseas person. In this essay, I trace how the concept – and its associated terminology — of overseas citizens and overseas persons has become a central feature of global governance and policy. I also highlight how overseas individuals are increasingly becoming the subjects",263,187

Abstract - GIS technology was introduced in the Indian scenario as a part of the Government Information Infrastructure (GII). This is a network of computers that can communicate with each other. It is used by the users to get information stored in any one of these computer systems. The Indian Government is in process of establishing a GIS-GIS based infrastructure for the entire nation. This infrastructure is being designed for data collection and storage of data in computer. GIS infrastructure can help in decision making, planning in different areas such as agriculture, health, education etc.
In this paper, the authors present an overview of GIS related policy in our country. We have discussed issues related to GIS in infrastructure management. Finally we present our opinion on how GIS can be effectively and efficiently implemented in a large country like India.",266,180

This paper attempts to understand and compare two of India’s largest, and fastest growing, infrastructural programmes - namely (1) Bharat Net, which aims to provide broadband connectivity to every panchayat – and ‘Digital Villages’, which will ensure digital services to all villages, in South Asian and East Asian countries. While these programmes have been implemented on different timelines, with the former having a headstart, both share similarities as they aim to connect the unconnected and are also aimed at rural areas. This paper aims at identifying the similarities and differences between the two programmes with a special focus on issues related to technology and infrastructure, funding, institutional framework, project implementation, as well as their outcomes with regard to the rural population.

Abstract
Access to a safe supply of drinking water is critical to ensure health, hygiene and overall well-being of a human. In rural areas, water scarcity has resulted in increased reliance on unprotected sources of water supply, leading to the spread of various water-related diseases. This paper assesses the status of safe drinking-water sources and sanitation coverage in the selected areas using secondary sources. It also explores the spatial patterns of these facilities and the socio-demographic variables of the area. The study also examines the association of WASH infrastructure facilities with the health status, socio-economic status and environmental variables. Using a spatial analysis, the study finds that the overall coverage of potable water facilities in India has increased from 57.5% in 1990 to 85.3% today. However, there are still large pockets of India",281,193

Abstract
The infrastructure system in India, is a major contributor of GDP and is also a critical factor for the overall development of the country. The development and maintenance of an efficient infrastructure is of utmost importance and it has been a subject matter of research for quite long. A lot of technologies and tools have been developed to help the infrastructure managers in this regard. Remote sensing satellite technology provides a cost effective way to monitor the condition of infrastructure and also helps in the identification of possible threats in an early stage. In order to meet the ever growing demands of this field, the remote sensor systems need to evolve continuously. India's own remote satellite is the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS). IRS has a long history and in recent times has also been playing a significant role in monitoring the national infrastructure. This thesis deals with the design and development on an advanced remote observation system based on the IRS. It is intended to be an all round monitoring system for national level infrastructure in a",283,196

This paper analyses the long-run dynamics of real growth across the Indian states. The analysis suggests that growth is determined by long run factors, such as capital, labour, physical capital and total factor productivity. In the analysis, the authors have used the standard longrun relationship of Solow (1957) with a Cobb-Douglas production function. A long term growth model has been developed to capture the effect of longterm investment and growth. Convergence between the states is also tested with standard statistical tests. This study has found some evidence of convergence between states but at a slow pace.

This has resulted in increased demand for cement, which is used for the manufacture of concrete.
The cement production industry consumes a large amount of cement and consumes huge resources (such as land and water) and energy. In addition, this industry is responsible for a significant amount (<20%) of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide [
This paper reviews the current state of calcium consumption in Indian cement plants and the status of various industrial by-products available for calcium use in cement industry. The present status and future trends of these industries and their byproducts with potential as raw material in concrete production are examined. Finally, opportunities and strategies for sustainable production of high calcium cement using industrial residues are identified. For this study, literature",285,191

Abstract
Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant market momentum in the automotive industry, and several countries have announced ambitious targets for electric mobility by 2030. However, the adoption of EVs faces a significant challenge in terms of the absence of an EV ecosystem. This study evaluates the viability of EV charging stations and assesses the performance of 10 charging companies operating in three different regions. The study finds that 3 out of every 4 charging facilities do not break even. It suggests that companies have to focus on reducing operational and infrastructure capex costs to reduce their charging cost and improve profitability.
The study also found that charging facility capitals are highly concentrated and the market is dominated by a few companies, indicating a potential for consolidation in future.",292,181

In recent times, infrastructure sector has been a key driver of economic growth in India. It is also evident that transport infrastructure is the foundation stone of the nation's economic development. This study seeks to understand how infrastructure and development in the transport sector can co-exist. The study focuses on one of India' s major corridors — the Mumbai-Chennai-Bangalore National Highway 4 (NH4). The corridor has witnessed unprecedented growth over the last decade. However, its development has not been planned in a coherent manner. While the NH4 corridor is seen by some as the engine of growth for the country' 'it has also been responsible for creating large-scale congestion that impedes economic activity.

The author analyzes the impact of infrastructure provision on the development and distribution of income and employment in the south Indian districts of Madurai, Salem, Erode, Coimbatore, Kottayam, Thiruvarur, Ramanathapuram in terms of their location in relation to urban centers. A survey of rural roads, bridges, irrigation and power projects was made in 1961; 70% of all rural households had access to irrigation, 30% were connected to electricity, while only 7.7% had road access. The rural development expenditure for this sample was calculated for the years 1956-1963. These results are analyzed in connection with income data collected for 1942-1951. An attempt to explain the relationship between the growth of agricultural exports in this region and infrastructure expenditure is made. Finally, some of these findings are applied to",296,187

Abstract
The urban poor face the most acute water poverty in India, with many lacking piped water. In response to this, they have developed a system based on self-supply of water through private wells and cisterns, often located in shared spaces. The study uses ethnography and participatory mapping to examine how the urban water system has been organised and governed through the private sector and by local government, in a poor neighbourhood. Drawing on the theoretical concepts of legal geographies, the study reveals how water infrastructure and the water service are divided between public and private sectors in informal settlements, and how this division is a result of the exclusion of public infrastructure in these communities.

Abstract
The infrastructure sector is the backbone of any developing country. With the advent of globalization, it is necessary for the infrastructure in the country to be upgraded, expanded and developed with more efficiency and effectiveness. Automation of infrastructure projects can be a very effective solution to meet this demand. However there are several challenges that face the implementation and adoption of automation in these projects. This paper discusses the key challenges in automation of these infrastructure sectors and suggests a framework for addressing them.

Abstract
Infrastructure provision has been considered essential for urban development and sustainable growth, while it is still an area of concern for Indian planners. There is a growing recognition of the need for better infrastructure in Indian cities. Inadequate infrastructure is often blamed for low quality of life, environmental damage and social disparities. However, it remains unclear which types of infrastructure are associated with better quality or value of land and housing in particular, and what factors can explain these relations. This paper examines the effect of different types and levels of accessibility and infrastructure on residential value in Rajokat. Accessibility measures used were travel time to key locations and the distance to railway stations. A total of 1000 residential properties were selected as the data was available for both accessibility measures. For analysis, data were collected using Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR). GWR models were used to investigate how the accessibility of each type of facility and level of access to the facility influences",302,197

The paper presents a framework to measure country risks in infrastructure development. The proposed framework builds on the literature of risk assessment in investment projects and on risk management in financial markets. It combines the concepts of investment risk and financial risk. In this framework, infrastructure projects are analysed according to their characteristics and the financial market's view of them. This framework allows the construction of a country-by-country infrastructure risk matrix. Using such a matrix, a set of infrastructure sectors can be identified, which are likely to provide a high level of return to capital while maintaining a low level.

This paper uses the data from the 2011 Census to analyse the extent of urban and infrastructural development of class- I cities in West bengal in 2001 and 2021. The data was extracted from various variables of housing, education, health, water and sanitation, and public utilities. We have found that the average growth rate of population in these cities is 2.6 per cent in urban areas and only 1 per- cent per year in rural areas of these class -1 cities. It has also been observed that there is an increase in the percentage share of the working age population (15-64 years) in both the class I towns of 4 percent and rural 5% respectively. In terms of literacy rate in class–I towns, it has been increased from 85.7 per hundred to 91.2 per hundreds. However, in terms literacy of rural India, we can see",307,198

A report prepared for a seminar held by the Indian Finance Ministry in January, “The Infrastructure Gap and Role of Finance,” concludes that India’s infrastructure (road, water, rail) needs are so great and the country has such a large infrastructure gap ($2 trillion) that there is a case for using reserves, including foreign reserves and foreign aid, to fill the gap.
India’a foreign currency reserves stand at over US$300 billion. India has been accumulating the reserves for over two decades. The reserves are used to meet any unforeseen shortfall in the trade balance. They have been deployed to purchase gold, which is the only other asset considered a safe and stable asset by India. Foreign exchange holdings have increased from $15 billion in 2002 to 300-plus billion today, while the foreign debt has increased only marginally. [See ""India: the",317,196

The gig economy is growing at a dizzying pace in the Global South. In response, many companies have adopted a business strategy that relies on the use of platforms to connect with a workforce — often in low-wage countries. These platforms are often touted as a means of providing workers with flexibility and economic opportunities, while also providing flexibility for employers to access workers inexpensively.
Despite the many promises and hype around gig work, we have yet to see a significant amount of research on this topic that is conducted from the perspective of women’s work and its intersections with gender, class, caste, race, and ability. The research that does exist has focused on gig economies in high-income countries where gig workers are mostly white, cisgender, able-bodied, native-English-speakers who are able to work from their own home.

Road infrastructure is a key determinant to the socio-economic development of a region. It provides a platform to connect people and businesses and enables trade to flourish. This study aims to analyse the economic benefits to rural and regional development from the improvement of infrastructure by assessing the impact of different categories of roads. The study focuses on the road infrastructures of rural areas. In the Indian context there was the need to assess the benefits accruing to agricultural growth in rural India. Hence the study also focused on agriculture in general and the role of agriculture to improve the quality of life of the rural people as well as on its role in the economy. For these reasons a study is carried out to examine the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth of two states, Karnataka and India, and to evaluate their performance in infrastructure. To this end, an attempt was done in this study to measure the performance of these two countries in terms of various",319,187

And, the third is a decline in the quality of our democratic institutions and processes. This challenge is evident in our politics and governance. But, it also reflects the growing alienation in society. There is an increasing feeling of despair, cynicism and disillusionment among large segments of society with regard to the future of democracy and the polity in general. In this context I would like to recall the words of Jawaharlal Nehru. It was during his 10 years as Prime Minister of India and he was addressing the Constituent Assembly on August 15, 1948.

This research explores the role of statutory infrastructure in spatial development and planning of peri – urban space around Bhabanipur and Durgapur Industrial areas, Burainganj and Purbachal in the city of Kolkata, which are located at the periphery of the main city area. The study aims to understand the extent to which the statutory infrastructural provisions made in 1991 have been used and how the spatial form of planning and developmental activities have changed in this peri urban area, since then. A GIS based spatial analysis was undertaken to map the infrastructual network and to compare the patterns and the density of these structures in both the periurban areas and in other areas of city, where there are statutory structures, using the data obtained from government and non-government agencies. Further, the study explores how these statutory infrastructures have affected the pattern of spatial use and growth of land use.",324,186

The paper discusses the role of infrastructure development in the process of economic growth. The paper argues that India has been a victim of poor infrastructure for decades and the government is now investing heavily to improve its infrastructure. This investment has led to improved connectivity between the different states of the country and has also led the states to compete with each other to attract investments. In the long run, the paper predicts that infrastructure will be the major growth factor in regional economic development.

The Infrakrol formation is a thick to thin-bedded carbonate platform sequence, exposed on the northern slopes of the Lessar Himal, and comprises two formations with an estimated thickness of >400m: (1) the K1 formation, composed of thick (>10–15m) carbonate units, which overlies a thin (<5m), siliciclastic unit [D1] ; 2) an ~ 200 m thick succession, the C2 formation. In both cases, thick platform sequences, with a siliclstic base, were deposited in an extensional basin setting during the mid-Proteroziic (~400 Ma). The Infrax1r formation comprises a sequence of platform-derived dolomitic and siliceous carbonates that are interspersed by mudstone-shale sequences. Dolomite was precipitated",327,188

The private sector has begun to provide financing for urban infrastructure, with a wide array of financial products for infrastructure development. This has led to the emergence of ‘private infrastructure finance,’ a term that embraces a whole range of different approaches to infrastructure financing that do not fall easily under the 'debt' or “equity' labels, as they can involve a mix of debt, equity, and revenue sharing with public agencies and/or government guarantees. The World Bank Group has been working with its member countries and with other agencies to better understand this new sector of infrastructure.

Abstract
The infrastructure sector in Indian has been witnessing a major transformation with the advent of liberalization and globalization. The Government of India has undertaken several initiatives like the Public Private Partnership, the Infrastructure Investment Fund of the Reserve Bank of india and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund to promote infrastructure development in the country. This thesis discusses the various initiatives undertaken by the Government and the issues faced in public private partnership and infrastructure investment fund. In the first chapter, an overview of PPP projects undertaken in various sectors such as energy and transportation is given. PPP is a new concept in developing infrastructure and has the potential to improve the productivity and efficiency of investment in these sectors. However, some key issues are faced while implementing PPP in energy sector such lack of transparency in procurement process, lack in capacity and expertise among public and private partners, high cost of",341,184

Indian infrastructure,"Engineering modernity: Water, electricity and the infrastructure landscapes of Bangalore, India","Engineering modernity: Water, electricity and the infrastructure landscapes of Bangalore, India, 1880–1940
The paper argues that the water, electric and gas infrastructure that came to be associated with the modern city of 'Bangalore' (also known as ""Bengaluru"" and ""'Garden City') was in fact the result of a complex process of appropriation and contestation of public and private resources. In a period of rapid urban development, the state, local communities, and individuals all engaged in the appropriation of these resources in ways that are still felt by citizens today. The paper will focus on 1899, a year marked by two important milestones, when a waterworks was completed and a grid electricity network was built, both of which had a significant impact on the lives of many Bangaloreans at the time.

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of various land acquisition instruments used by the Government of India and their impact on infrastructure development in the country. Land acquisition has been the most contentious issue for the infrastructure projects, in particular the ones that are being developed in rural areas. The government has used both the legislative and institutional measures to ensure that the land is acquired for infrastructure. This paper examines the institutional and legislative arrangements for land acquisitions, especially the impact of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 on land prices in India.

Abstract
The paper aims to assess housing affordability and the quality of basic public infrastructure provision in cities across the country. The data for this paper was collected from a sample of 50 cities from across 22 States and 6 Union Territories using a multi-stage sampling technique. Using these data, two indices for housing accessibility and infrastructure have been built at the city level. These indices provide a measure of the extent of access that people living in urban areas have to essential infrastructure as well as their living conditions and quality. In the present research, we employ the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression to find that housing is more accessible in large cities compared to smaller cities. This is particularly evident for people with lower socio- economic groups. Housing accessibility in larger cities",346,199

An assessment of PPP projects is made and the paper concludes that the PPPs are an effective tool for public sector financing. However, the implementation of these schemes is not free of hurdles and therefore, PPP implementation must continue to be a continuous and iterative process. It is concluded that India must learn from the experiences of other countries and develop an optimal PPP model for itself.

The procurement of public infrastructure projects by private parties in developing economies is a relatively new phenomenon. It is now widely believed by policy-makers and practitioners that this mode of procurement has the potential to bring about improvements in delivery and efficiency in the public sector in terms of cost and quality, while at the same time creating an opportunity for private capital for investment in infrastructure sectors in these developing countries, where capital flows are otherwise not easily available. This article explores the various aspects of this phenomenon in particular in relation to social infrastructures in India, and the role that private sector participation and PPP / PFI could potentially play in delivering social outcomes. The paper discusses the issues that need to be carefully considered in undertaking the procurement analysis, with particular reference to waste-to-energy projects, the first project of its type in (South) India.

The role of political instability is explored through a panel data of 32 Indian states for the period 1901-2004. We find that the infrastructure performance of the least-developed states increases when political parties change and the number of coalition governments falls, while it declines when the political system remains stable. The results suggest that coalition parties and stable government may increase the risk of corruption and lead to more political rents for politicians, which in turn may reduce public investment. These results are robust to a variety of specifications and empirical strategies. They also remain significant after controlling for economic factors and other institutional differences such as land use regulation, and after the inclusion of lagged and lag-squared infrastructure indicators in the analysis.",351,187

Abstract
Water is a common pool resource in many parts of India, where the institutional framework and capacity is weak. This paper investigates the role that games might have in strengthening institutional frameworks in this context, by designing experimental games to assess the impact of a range of institutional measures. We test the effects of different types of water governance on the performance of common infrastructures by conducting an experiment in 10 rural water and sanitation schemes. The experimental design allows us to estimate the effect of governance types on a variety of measures such as water availability, cost, quality and quantity of service. Our results suggest that, when water is managed by a self-help group, water supply and service quality are better, while cost and water quantity are worse. When water management is through a panchayat, service quantity, supply costs and quality of services",352,184

It is found that the overall capital stock in these sectors is rising at a fast pace, with the highest growth rates being observed in transportation and communication sectors of about 7-8 per cent per annum. However, the growth in Kc is declining steadily for all sectors since 1986-87 with an exception of construction sector for which it is still increasing. In the long run, a higher level of K c would be required, which may be achieved by the government through the implementation of appropriate policy.",353,183

The fisheries of the Indian Ocean are an essential part of food security for many of its 1.25 billion people. As a result, there is much at stake in the sustainable use of marine fisheries.
In the face of a rising global need for seafood, fisheries can play an increasingly important part in feeding a growing population – but only with sustainable fishing practices. Fisheries management and conservation are key to ensuring the long-term availability of seafood for the people of coastal communities, who are often the poorest. However, in this rapidly developing world, fishing pressure and other threats are on the rise. The oceans are not a resource that can be taken for granted.

Abstract
Despite the increasing attention on public spaces and public utilities, the provision of public water and sanitation services remains a challenge across low-income cities worldwide. The study presents new data from a randomized field experiment on the effects of infrastructure on sanitation mobilization in the context of water provision in a low income urban area of Delhi. We find that the presence of pipED water, but not the availability of toilets, affects mobilization to build toilets.

Indian infrastructure,Determinants of publicprivate partnership in infrastructure: empirical evidences from India,"Determinants of publicprivate partnership in infrastructure: empirical evidences from India
AbstractThis paper investigates the determinants of Public Private Partnership (PPP) in the infrastructure sector using the panel data from the year 1993-2008 covering the entire period when PPP was initiated in Indias infrastructure development. The study is undertaken by using panel ordinary least square, fixed effect regression model. Empirical results suggest that the government's expenditure and the size of infrastructure are significant determinants in PPP. In addition, the study also reveals that in case of road projects, government spending, and size are positive while government borrowing and project location are negative. Further, it is found that government expenditure, project size and bank finance have significantly and positively impact on the PPP in roads sector.
The study concludes that there should be a greater emphasis on improving project management and financial management in order to promote PPPs. It also recommends that governments should focus on infrastructure investment in rural areas to reduce ruralurban migration. Moreover, banks should increase their",358,191

In South Asian countries, economic growth is also expected to slow down by the mid-203Os, although population growth will be slower than in Southeast Asia. Economic growth in South and Central Asia will, however, be much higher than average, because the countries of South-Central Asia have more room for growth than their East Asian counterparts.",363,188

Abstract
The research examines the Chinese and India’s investment strategies in Africa, especially on Ethiopia and Kenya. This study focuses on Chinese investment projects in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, and its surrounding industrial area. The study also looks at the investment of the Indian in Kenya’ s port town Mombasa. In this study the author argues that the main motive behind China and to some extent India to invest heavily in infrastructure in African countries is for the development of a new “dept-traps” diplomacy and a ‘’new colonialism’’ in disguise. According to the study, both China as well as India are using Africa as their own backyard and playground to pursue their national interests as a major source of raw materials for its industries as part of ’’neo-",364,184

Abstract
This thesis is a research work that has examined different aspects of the role infrastructural development plays in addressing the challenges associated with human settlement development. The study sought to examine different factors that have contributed to poor development of human habitation in urban and rural areas. This has been done through an analysis of factors such as lack of access to land, inadequate infrastructure, high cost of land and housing, and poor access for water, drainage and waste facilities. It has also sought answers to questions such, as why some settlements have developed at faster rates than others, why there is still a large disparity in the provision of services across regions and urban areas and why infrastructure provision has remained a constant issue in rural and small urban settlements despite government interventions over the years. To address these questions, the research has employed a mix",366,190

Infrastructure development in India has been a top priority of the government of late. In the Union Budget 2013-14, the finance minister had made a strong case for the need for a major push in infrastructure development.
The government has launched a series of initiatives - National Highways Development Programme (NHDP), Dedicated Freight Corridor (""DFC"") and Bharatmala (“National High-Speed Rail Network”) – to address issues such as lack of infrastructure and connectivity. The National Investment Fund for Highway Infrastructure ""National Highway Investment Grid"" is another ambitious initiative in this context.

The infrastructure sector is critical for India’s growth and economic stability
In India, infrastructure development is a long-term endeavour. However, it is important for growth of the country's economy and to create jobs. The infrastructure projects undertaken by public sector enterprises in the past have been plagued by a number of challenges, mainly with respect to financing. In addition, the projects are often delayed due to land issues, lack of environmental clearances and disputes with locals. Further, due delays in infrastructure project delivery, many projects become unviable. As a result, there is an urgent need to review and improve the financing models for infrastructure.
Key challenges and issues
There are a variety of issues associated with infrastructure financing in emerging economies. Some common issues are:
· Financing the entire lifecycle: Financing infrastructure assets requires long investment cycles. Financing is needed for land",378,183

Excerpt
This paper analyses the relationship between regional disparity and infrastructure investment in India using panel data of district level data for the years 2004-2009. The paper uses panel unit root and cointegration analysis. Using panel co-integration test, this paper finds that infrastructure spending and regional disparities cointegrate. However, the test of panel Granger causality shows that regional inequalities in infrastructure are not causally related to regional inequality in economic development.

These are estimated to cost INR 1,800 trillion and include airports, ports, roads, power plants and transmission networks.
In a move to improve the country’s competitiveness in infrastructure, the government announced the creation of a National Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency (NIPFA). NIPTA will replace a number of agencies, which will provide a platform to help investors and businesses to navigate the complex process involved in getting infrastructure investments off the ground. NIFT will also work to create a single window for investment.

Indian infrastructure,"Place-based public investment in regional infrastructure, the locational choice of firms and regional performance: the case of India","Place-based public investment in regional infrastructure, the locational choice of firms and regional performance: the case of India
This paper examines the impact of public investments in infrastructure on the location choices, firm performance as well as the economic performance of regions. The empirical analysis focuses on India, a developing country which has witnessed a surge in public infrastructure investment, particularly in the transport sector. This study examines three main aspects of infrastructure provision: (i) the level of the provision of transport infrastructure across the country, ‘place-making’ infrastructure that is, transport links that are not only of high quality but also connect different regions and cities;,and 3) infrastructure as a locative asset. These three aspects have important implications for the firm and the regional economic development. We use a panel data of 1,200 firms from the 2004-05 and 2010-11 surveys to analyse the effect of place-specific public capital investment and locator choice on firm location decisions and their economic outcomes. Our findings show that",382,187

Abstract
The purpose of this article is to explore the role of infrastructure in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Indian districts and its impact on growth. We employ District-Level Data [DLD] in 2011 to 13 from National Sample Surveys Office – Integrated Household Survey 3 & Census 2001. The results of panel data regression analysis reveal a positive impact of road and electricity in increasing the likelihood of FID while the rest of the infrastructure variables show a negative impact. Further, road, power and telephone are important determinants of economic growth, while electricity is the least important one as the share of electricity infrastructure investment to GDP has declined from 8.3 per cent in the 12th Plan to just 4.1 per.

This paper provides evidence on the relationship between infrastructure and population growth in aglomerations (cities) in India. Using a panel of 36 Indian cities for 1981-2001, and a fixed effects panel approach, we find that increases in the number of roads per km2 lead to a significant increase in population per sq km in both rural and urban areas; the effect is stronger in rural areas. Increases in power and water supply per capita lead, on average, to population increases of about 0.2 and 1.5 per annum respectively. These findings are robust to various robustness checks.

The paper presents an overview of the rural and agricultural infrastructure in Southern Africa. The rural areas have been described as the most neglected in the world with an estimated rural population of 70 % of Africa’s total. As a result, the development of infrastructure such as transport, communication, education, health facilities and water has remained at a snail’ s pace, leaving the majority with little or no access to these basic human needs. Rural Africa has the poorest road network compared to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, with only 30 000 km out of an approximate distance of more than 10",388,180

AbstractThis paper examines the infrastructure production function and its determinants for India over the period 1950–2000. Using a vector error-correction method, we investigate the role of infrastructure in the growth of output in different regions of India, and the contribution of the different components of capital input to the output of different infrastructure sectors. Our findings reveal that the elasticity of growth in infrastructure to its output is higher for capital and less so for labor. We find that there is a strong positive relationship between growth rates of regional GDP and infrastructure. Further, the regional differences in infrastructural inputs for a given level of GDP indicate that infrastructure is not equally important for every sector in all the regions. This finding is particularly true for the power sector; in fact, infrastructure investment in this sector is much less important in certain states. In contrast, there seems to be a significant and positive role for infrastructure for manufacturing and agriculture. These two sectors are more capital intensive in nature, indicating",391,195

Abstract
Introduction
In India, immunization programmes are carried out through the public sector, where vaccine storage facilities are often inadequate. Inadequate cold-chain storage conditions are associated with vaccine failure and the loss of efficacy of the vaccine. The vial monitor (VM) is an indicator of whether a vaccine is in cold conditions and is considered an objective indicator.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted between June–August 2014 in the tribal district, Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh, India. A total of 50 health facilities were selected, using multi-stage sampling, to study the relationship between VM and other variables such as the type of refrigerator, temperature of refrigerators, and presence/absence of power failure at the facility. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, t-test and binary logistic regression. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results were presented in figures.",396,190

However, the performance of public private partnerships in this sub-sector was not satisfactory for various reasons, and hence, there was a need to explore private sector participation in WASH sector. In recent years, private participation has taken a different shape in water sector in terms of new models, which can be broadly categorized as PublicPrivate Partnership - Build & Operate and Public Private Partnership-Transfer. Both these models have different implications for government and private partners, but the success of PPP depends on a number of factors like availability of suitable project, availability/cost of finance, political will, regulatory and institutional issues in both government ",403,189

Abstract
This project seeks to examine the impact and implications of the construction and maintenance of a major road infrastructure – the NH- 200 - in India through the life of one village in northern Manpur. In this paper, I will explore what I refer to as 'the roads not taken' that are not only the roads that could have been built in the area, but also the ones whose construction or maintenance was prevented in order to preserve the existing ‘natural’ landscape, the natural resources within the villages or to allow for the preservation of “traditional” practices. I focus on these two types of roads as they have emerged over time and the different political and social forces that shaped their evolution. By examining the ways in which these roads and their impacts have become inscribed on local land and memory, my project is concerned with both",406,193

Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Sustainable development can be defined in many ways. Some of them are:
• Sustainable use of resources
- The concept of sustainable use means that the resources we use now can still exist in the future.
In other words, it is using resources in such a way that they are available for future use. It is the concept that we can use the natural resources, which can replenish themselves, in a sustainable way to satisfy our needs without damaging the environment in future generation. For example, using the forests and its products for food, shelter, clothing and firewood etc. The resources of our environment are called renewable because they can replace themselves. These include water (rain and snow), sunlight, trees & plants, soil and so on. Non-renewable resources are natural substances which are not renewed or cannot be regenerated",408,193

Water provision is a complex process with multiple layers of interactions between the actors and infrastructure that supply it (“provisioning”). This article explores the role of infrastructure in the production of water supply and sanitation services and in particular the ways it is co-produced. We use an ethnographically grounded case-study to examine the interactions of three actors - the state, a local private water company, “local entrepreneurs”, the local community and the infrastructure [a dam/waterworks, distribution network, water treatment plant, tank and pumps] -, to produce water for a population of some 100,000 in one mid-sized Indian city.

Abstract
India was among the few countries to privatize its airports and deregulate its air transportation sector in the mid of nineties. This study analyzes the investment decisions and the capacity development of India's airport operators in post privatization era in order to ascertain the impact of privatizing and regulating the Indian air cargo industry. The study also examines the effects of macroeconomic factors on the airport investment in India over the period of 1995 -2010. Using co-integration and error correction modeling approaches, the study examines various determinants of airport capacity and investment by airport operator and identifies the factors responsible for the growth in airport investments in this period. Further, we also identify the sources and magnitude of the macro factors that affect the airline industry and in turn affect airport capacities and investments. We find that the privatized airports are more likely to invest in their infrastructure and increase capacity in response to economic growth. However",413,196

The World bank, a global financial institution, is increasingly becoming a key player in shaping policy and infrastructure investment in emerging postcolonial urban centers. This paper examines the ways in which policy making in urban areas has been influenced by, and has influenced, the workings of this institution. The paper begins with an exploration of how policy makers in Delhi, India have attempted to negotiate and co-opt the Bank’s policies to serve their political agendas and economic priorities. It then turns to the way the institution itself has shaped the policy process in post colonial India, through its influence on the state. By tracing the influence of one institution in two countries, it demonstrates that the bank is only one actor in a process that involves a range of other actors in different national contexts. As such, this paper argues that understanding and analysing the complex and often contradictory ways that development finance institutions influence policy is essential if we are to understand the processes",417,190
Indian infrastructure,Determining the provision of wastewater management infrastructure in rural India from the local communities' perspectives,"Determining the provision of wastewater management infrastructure in rural India from the local communities' perspectives - A mixed method analysis of data collected from a participatory GIS study in the state of Rajasthan, India
The provisioning of basic infrastructure for rural communities is crucial for the economic and social well-being of the inhabitants and the functioning of an effective society in developing countries. While a number of studies have examined water infrastructure provision in urban and peri-urban India, the question of how rural residents perceive the importance of and their access to wastewater and water management facilities and services is still largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap.
For this purpose, a Participatory GIS approach was applied in a village of northwestern India to assess the residents’ perception of water and wastewater infrastructure and to analyse their use. The data gathered during the field survey was supplemented by semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders to explore the factors affecting access and infrastructure development. In addition, water supply and sanitation facilities were inspected in order to determine the quality of services. Results show that the village population has",418,197

AbstractWe analyze the impact of growth of urban slum population, the availability and quality of public infrastructure in urban areas on health of the slummers, and the health outcomes of their children. The health outcome of children is measured using child anthropometric data for the period 2012-2013. Using ‘difference in difference’ approach we show that slumming growth is associated with decline in child height of 1.2 cm (p=0.05). However, slumping is positively linked with children’s growth in the first 2 years as well as in later years. Slumping and growth are not mutually exclusive. Children born in a slummy household are more susceptible to diseases than their counterparts born into non slumpy households. They are susceptible due to their early exposure to poor quality environment and low level of care and nutrition as a child. We observe that poor infrastructure leads to higher probability of diarr",421,188

Infrastructure development is a vital factor for the growth of the economy. The study aims to identify factors that affect the delivery of infrastructure development projects. In addition, the research aims at identifying the factors affecting the duration of such projects, in order to help government and policy makers in the development of an effective policy. A structured questionnaire was developed and sent to 50 experts. Experts were also asked to provide inputs on the questionnaire in three stages. After the first stage, 40 responses were received. This was followed by a second stage where 20 experts were interviewed for validation. 10 of these responses have been excluded for analysis. Delphi technique was used to obtain the remaining 60 responses. It was found that lack of coordination is the single most important factor affecting delay in project implementation. Other factors identified as important were poor project appraisal, poor planning, lack in human resources, inadequate project management, financial crisis, and lack or insufficient monitoring/ evaluation.",426,200

Abstract
Colonialism in the subcontinent of India was accompanied by a large-scale expansion of modern public and civil infrastructure, as well as an extensive public building programme, including the establishment of an Indian Public Works Department. In the context of British rule, public infrastructure was a key element of political power, and the building of colonial infrastructure became a major instrument of imperial policy. However, little has been written about public architecture and infrastructure from a historiographical perspective. The present chapter will therefore examine, from an analytical perspective, both the nature of public buildings in Colonial India and their role as symbols of power and colonial rule. It will be argued that, although the buildings were often impressive in terms of architectural design, they were, in reality, an inadequate symbol of a modernised state and a civil society. They represented the colonial power's control over the local population rather than its political and",432,186

AbstractThis paper studies the determinants of infrastructure development, using data on the growth of the economy and the stock of non-traded infrastructure in India. We find that non tradeable infrastructure has a negative impact on economic growth and that the impact has been increasing over the post-1990 period, suggesting that policy makers have not fully taken advantage of economies of scale in infrastructure creation. The results also suggest that, over this period of time, the government sector has not been particularly effective at building infrastructure and it has had a limited impact in promoting economic: 1-13

Abstract
In this paper, we assess the impact of the social structure of cities, measured by the number of people living in urban clusters, on the spread of COVID 19. The analysis covers 29 states and 2 Union Territories in India. We employ the Bayesian spatial autoregressive model for the spatial transmission of coronavirus disease, as well as a time trend model to analyze the role of social structures and the government response in mitigating its impact.
We find strong evidence that the size and density of urban population are significant predictors of infections and deaths in cities and towns in 2020. In terms of mortality, the effect of density on infection is twice that of population density. Moreover, our estimates reveal that cities with large populations and a low density, like Chandigarh, Delhi NCR, and Mumbai, had a higher infection and death rate compared to cities like Lucknow,",438,184

Indian infrastructure,"Provisioning health care infrastructure in communities: Empirical evidences from West Bengal, India","Provisioning health care infrastructure in communities: Empirical evidences from West Bengal, India
AbstractThis article presents empirical evidances for assessing the extent of provisioning of health infrastructure and health service delivery in West Benga. The data are taken from a household survey in 1998. A multinomial logistic regression model has been adopted for the analysis. It is found that the demand for and utilization of primary care has increased with age, female gender, urban residence and higher education. Demand for hospital services has also increased over the period of the survey but has declined over time. Provisioning has improved over a period and has reached the rural communities as well. Female gender and urban residency have had a positive effect on the use of modern health facilities. However, the level of education and rural or urban resident status have not had any influence on health services utilization. Finally, this paper concludes that in the absence of adequate supply of infrastructure the need for health provision will be met through out-of-pocket expenditure or private health): ",450,188

Urban planning in Brazil is a complex phenomenon in its historical development, in the sense that the materialization of the urban space is strongly related to the political-ideological and cultural contexts of a given moment. As a material manifestation of social relations, urban planning is an expression of power. This paper will analyze some of these relations in Brazilian urban history through the construction and management of infrastructures, and will focus on the relationship between urban development and the formation of urban identities, as well as on its impact on social, economic and ethnic relations of exclusion.",451,194

Abstract
Rapid urbanization (URB) in the Asia Pacific is often seen as the key driver of economic, social and cultural change. In this thesis I explore the implications of this phenomenon in three Asian countries - India, China, and Bangladesh. I look at the challenges of infrastructure development, governance issues of land and environment, gender and class dynamics and their implications on urban growth. These issues have been explored in a historical perspective in each country. The focus is on the last two decades as a period of URB in these countries. India has undergone a rapid growth of urban population from 30% in 1991 to 37.7% 2011. This has brought along its own set of challenges, particularly for the poor. China has experienced the largest scale urban URM in any country in history with urbanisation reaching ",453,194
Indian infrastructure,Conceptualising environmental justice in the construction of road transport infrastructure in the Global South: an Indian context,"Conceptualising environmental justice in the construction of road transport infrastructure in the Global South: an Indian context
Abstract
In the last few decades, the road has been the backbone of infrastructure projects in India. However, there has not been a corresponding growth in road networks in urban areas and the existing roads have not seen much maintenance. The construction and maintenance of the roads in a country like India is one of its most significant development issues, but little attention has so far been paid to the impacts of roads on local communities living nearby. In India, many people are affected by road construction projects, and a growing literature shows that the environmental, economic and social impacts are not well managed. This paper examines the issue of environmental injustice from the perspective of those who are directly affected. It analyses the case of a proposed road development in Delhi, India that was to be built in an area with low economic status. A participatory action research project that used action-based research methods is presented in this paper.

Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of regional infrastructure, especially roads and electricity, on income levels in South Asian countries using time series data from 1985 to 2005. The econometric analysis is based on the system GMM model using panel data of 14 South American countries. It has been found that the level of income per capita in a region has positive correlation with the amount of road infrastructure and the number of kilowatts of electricity produced. However, the effects of these two types of infrastructural development on economic growth are different. Road infrastructurally developed regions show higher rates of growth in income but the effect of electrical infrastructure is limited.

We use a newly developed index of income equality to measure the extent of inequality and a panel data approach in order to capture the influence of various factors. The empirical results indicate that health and educational infrastructure have reduced the gap between rich and poor but transport has increased inequalities. This is in line with the theoretical arguments on the role of transport in income distribution.",462,186

Abstract
The paper examines the impact of economic liberalisation on port and port-related infrastructure in India, with specific reference to port capacity development and management, port governance and regulation, and private investment in infrastructure. While globalisation of Indian economy has opened up new vistas of growth, the country’s ports remain the weak link in international trade. Port capacity constraints, lack of proper regulatory framework, absence of a unified system for tariff setting and determination, non-availability of modern equipment and technology, poor infrastructure and services, high logistics cost, etc., pose a challenge to the efficient functioning of the ports. Globalisation has also led to a shift in the ownership of ports from the government sector to private and institutional investors. However, in spite of these changes, it may be concluded that the Indian ports have been unable to keep pace with the changes in global trade and remain in a state of relative ‘",466,182

Abstract
A large body of empirical studies has established that the location, quality and accessibility of schools affect students’ learning outcomes. However, few studies explore the impact of public infrastructure on private school choice and school quality. Using a unique dataset with a detailed geographic information system for the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, this study estimates the effect of infrastructure development around private and public schools on the probability of students achieving the minimum level of primary schooling. In addition, it investigates how the infrastructure around schools may influence the quality of the private education offered. This paper shows that students living in low-infrastructure areas are 2.1 times more likely to drop out of school. Moreover, the presence of higher education infrastructure is negatively related to enrolment in private primary schools. The proximity to public primary, secondary and tertiary education facilities also influences schooling outcomes, especially in terms of dropout rates in public and private private schooling and enrolments in primary education.

We employ two methods — panel co-integration and vector auto-regression (VAR) for cointegration analysis and impulse response function approach for impact evaluation. The paper provides strong evidence of the cointegrating relationship among health inputs and health output. It is further established that an increase in health input leads to an increasing health outcome. An increase of 1 percentage point in public health expenditure leads 0.8 percentage points and increase 2 per cent point of private health spending leads, respectively, to a decline in infant and adult mortality. Our findings suggest that government’s health policies should be directed in such a manner that it increases the efficiency of health",470,195

The paper investigates the effect of banking outreach in India on the financial inclusion of the rural poor. The rural households in this study are selected from a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 households that is representative of India's rural population. Banking outreach is defined as the number of branches per 1000 people residing in a district. It is found that a 10% increase in the banking coverage in districts leads to a higher probability of having a formal bank account for the households. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that banking services are complementary. However, the study also reveals a significant impact of branch density on formal savings. These savings are found to be positively correlated with branch densities as well as with banking penetration in rural India.",471,199

In this paper empirical analysis of exit events from 100 Venture Capital funded portfolio companies in the infrastructure sector is done. The results are based on a survey conducted among the founders of the 50 portfolio exits and 25 of their investors. We find that in general the average venture capitalists get 2 to 3 times of his/her money back, though a few firms do extremely well. In terms of returns, we see that exits through trade sales or initial public offerings are more profitable than through buyouts. However in terms investment returns venture funds do poorly, since the portfolio firms are mostly in growth phase. There is a clear correlation between the size of venture capitalist’s commitment and the investment made by him. This indicates that the venture fund managers do not invest aggressively when they know that they have a limited amount of fund to deploy, and are therefore more conservative with the fund they are entrusted",472,181

Abstract
This paper aims to present an overview of the current status and future needs of adaptive education in India, particularly for disaster prone urban areas and the role of higher educational institutions in providing adaptive infrastructure. A review of current adaptive design and construction practices in higher eduction institutes was carried out to assess the state of adaptation in this area. These practices were then evaluated based on a set of indicators to identify gaps in adaptive capacity in Indian educational infrastructure design practice. The identified gaps were assessed for current practices, as well as for future adaptation requirements. This analysis was followed by a discussion of potential adaptive pathway opportunities in urban India and suggested measures for improving disaster resilience. It is concluded that adaptive educational practices are still nascent in many parts of India. Current and emerging practices require greater attention from educational stakeholders as part of an adaptive strategy for infrastructure for the disaster risk and climate change era to develop.

This paper presents some of the main findings and recommendations emerging from a recent research project on public employment and poverty reduction, which was conducted in India for UNDP, the United Nations Development Programme. In this paper the authors explore the extent to which the employment programmes and public investment programmes of India's successive governments - the Planning Commission and the Department for Public Works (DPW) – have contributed to the eradication of poverty and to improvements in the living conditions of rural people. The paper argues that there are many examples of success.
In the period 1993-94, when the DPW was given the additional task of providing employment for unskilled and semi-skilled people, it achieved a significant increase in rural employment, especially in small-scale construction works. But, despite the efforts of successive DPWs, employment through the public work programmes remained limited to a small fraction of all",478,184

The infra orbitalforamenis a rare foramina. In this study we evaluated the infraorbitalforamina of 100 south Indian dry skull specimens. The mean depth of theforamain (MFD) was 8.2mm [range: 5.3mm to 9.8mm]. The infra-orbita foraminal position was observed to be slightly superior in males 0.26mm and slightly inferior in females -0mm. This position offoramin was seen to have a statistical significant relation with the positionof the maxilla. Foramina position showed no significant association with skull length. However, the length of foramin in relation to the distance from the foramenta was significantly correlated in male 1.03mm/cm, but in female 2.5mm for each millimeter increase.

Abstract
Background and Purpose: Ehealth infrastructure in India is in the nascent stage of development. This paper aims to analyze the existing e-health infrastructures in rural India with regard to various aspects like availability of ehealth services, infrastructure, equipment, human resources and e -training facilities.
Materials and Methods: This is an analysis type of research work with the data being collected from various government health centres, district health authorities and medical college hospitals in different rural blocks of the state of Madhya Pradesh in Central India
Results: In the rural areas of India the main challenge to the use of technology based e health solutions is to have a strong network and infrastructure. The rural block of Chhatarpur has 10 PHCs with 2.5 computers, the block has no district hospital, it had 3 hospitals. In this block only 1 computer is connected in 5 PCH’s, 4 computers are connected",483,196
Indian infrastructure,India evolving: Infrastructure since 1991,"India evolving: Infrastructure since 1991
Infrastructure development in India is one of the fastest-growing sectors that contributes to the economy of India to a great extent. Since Independence, India has been witnessing a massive shift in the way the country has developed infrastructure. The government has taken initiatives for the growth of different sectors.
From roads to airports, there has seen a lot of improvement in infrastructure in recent years. However, the government can only do its best, and the rest of it is left on individuals to take care of. Infrastructure plays a very significant role in a country and is responsible for a smooth and easy way for people to commute. There has to be a proper flow of traffic, so the infrastructure of a particular city or country needs to support the movement of people. It would help if you considered the importance of infrastructure as well as the challenges India faces in this sector. Read on to know more about the current situation of this industry.

Indian infrastructure,Village transportation infrastructure and women's non-agricultural employment in India: The conditioning role of community gender context,"Village transportation infrastructure and women's non-agricultural employment in India: The conditioning role of community gender context
AbstractWomen in many developing communities face constraints that make it difficult for them to access nonagriculture employment. This paper investigates whether transportation and other infrastructural development conditions women’s employment choices and their nonfarm earnings. The paper is based on data collected from the 2006 India Demographic and Health Survey. Logistic regression is employed to analyze the effects of infrastructure on women. It is found that the distance to transportation facilities significantly influences the probability of women being engaged in non farm activities in both urban and rural areas. However, there is no evidence that transportation conditions affect non‐farm wage rates and this may suggest that women are able to find non agricultural jobs that have the characteristics that they want. These findings support the argument that infrastructure is important, and can facilitate women employment but cannot guarantee women a better earnings from non agriculture): 8 (2011)

Indian infrastructure,National development banks and sustainable infrastructure in South Asia,"National development banks and sustainable infrastructure in South Asia
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are two leading international organizations providing financial assistance to the public sector for infrastructure investments. In this article, I analyze the role of these institutions in supporting infrastructure investment projects in four South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. I show that the WB and ADB are major financiers of public infrastructure and have supported a wide range of investments in the countries under study, including roads, ports, energy, water and sanitation, transport and logistics, telecommunications, railways and airports (Table 1). This is despite the fact that these four countries have some of the lowest public investment in infrastructure per capita and per GDP.
A recent analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that by 2050, South Asians will be the largest population group with an annual household income of less than US$10,000, with 600 million people falling into that bracket.1 To meet the infrastructure needs of a growing economy and",486,196

Indian infrastructure,China's Belt and Road Initiative and India's options: Competitive cooperation,"China's Belt and Road Initiative and India's options: Competitive cooperation for a better future
Abstract
The Belt. The Indian Government is yet to formulate a comprehensive strategy in this regard. This paper argues that India and China can benefit from cooperation to address the challenges of development and to achieve sustainable development goals. It is proposed that there needs to be a new strategic paradigm to enhance the benefits of cooperation. India’s economic growth and poverty reduction can be achieved if the two major powers cooperate on infrastructure development, which can create jobs and improve economic prospects for their populations. A strategic dialogue among the three countries, including their development institutions and the financial institutions, would be in order. China and Japan have already started the process of economic cooperation; it is time for India too to develop its own strategy for cooperation with the Chinese government.

Indian infrastructure,Determinants of smart digital infrastructure diffusion for urban public services,"Determinants of smart digital infrastructure diffusion for urban public services
AbstractDigital transformation in the delivery of public sector services in cities is a complex process of change. Smart digital infrastructures are a prerequisite for cities to successfully develop their digital transformation. This research investigates the role of the determinants of diffusion of digital smart infrastructures that cities implement in their smart city strategies. The study aims to understand the factors that influence the diffusion process and to identify the most relevant ones. In particular, the study analyzes the impact of three factors in influencing diffusion: (1) government policies, ; 2) the ICT sector, and 3) citizens. A literature review of 12 studies on the use of ICT in public administration, a review based on 14 documents, an analysis of a survey carried out in 2013 by Eurobarometer and an original questionnaire on ICT use in urban services, conducted in October - November 2020 among the members of CEMR '",489,183

By: John Radsan
Policymakers in the developed world have a growing interest in using development assistance to support security in developing nations. The use of military assistance has historically been limited to a few situations such as post-conflict or fragile states, although a number of donors have begun to consider military aid for development purposes.
A recent report commissioned by the Swedish International Development Agency and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs examines the possible use and impact of a military component within a broader peacebuilding assistance strategy. It examines how military assets could be used to promote peace and security by assisting rural communities to manage the impacts of armed violence and insecurity. A number the key issues examined by this report are explored in further detail in this article. These include the use, and misuse, by governments of their national armies",491,186

Abstract
The objective of this paper is to examine the potential use of sovereign and sub sovereign bonds to finance infrastructure investment in sub Saharan Africa. In sub saharan Africa, the infrastructure deficit and the lack of access to credit are key constraints to business growth. This paper argues that the issuance of infrastructure specific subsovreign debt securities can help to overcome these barriers. It also examines the use by sub sovegiron countries of guarantees, sovereign, and other public instruments to facilitate debt issuance by private investors. The paper examines these issues in the light of the recent issuance and successful issuance, of a sovereign sub debt instrument by a developing country, Mauritius.",492,184
Indian infrastructure,ICT and Rural Infrastructure: Cases from Indian Rural Sector.,"ICT and Rural Infrastructure: Cases from Indian Rural Sector.
Rural Infrastructure in India: The Indian government had been working hard for the development and growth of rural infrastructure, to make the life comfortable for villagers. This article discusses how the government has been trying to improve the rural and agricultural sector infrastructure. The main emphasis has always been on rural roads, but it is the connectivity of villages to cities that has not been properly addressed. Rural roads are the main arteries of the country and are also the backbone of our rural economy. These rural road networks have been in a bad shape for decades now. It is important for us to understand how our government is trying its best to develop the infrastructure network to connect these rural areas to urban cities. In this article, we will discuss some of these initiatives.",493,194
Indian infrastructure,"Dynamics among banking penetration, transport infrastructure, and regional growth: an empirical note from Indian states","Dynamics among banking penetration, transport infrastructure, and regional growth: an empirical note from Indian states
This paper analyzes the relationship between transport and bank branches in 36 districts of India from 2001 to 2011. We investigate whether there is a link between the two at the aggregate, state, or regional level. The data set contains 2,300 districts. At the regional scale, we use the district level distance to the state headquarters as a proxy for bank penetration. Transport infrastructure is proxied by distance of the center of district to state capital. Our empirical analysis shows that transport does not impact banking, but banking impacts transport. In contrast to earlier research, the effect of banking is more significant on rural than urban areas.",494,200
Indian infrastructure,Dispute Resolution: Weighing the Need For a Construction Law in India,"Dispute Resolution: Weighing the Need For a Construction Law in India
Disputes in construction projects are inevitable, and a large number of cases go for arbitration. The Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 (“the 1976 Act”) and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (2015) “the Act” have been the two most important laws on arbitration in the country since India became a Republic.
In 2016, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry introduced the construction sector dispute resolution (""CSDR"") Scheme, under which, disputes arising out of a construction contract are to be referred to a single arbitrator. This arbitral process is meant to ensure speedy resolution of disputes in a cost effective manner with a minimum of interference by the Courts. In India, arbitration has been accepted as a preferred method of dispute redressal. While, in many cases, there is a need of an alternative means of adjudication and adjudications have resulted",495,182

Indian infrastructure,The Scenario of FDI in Infrastructure of India,"The Scenario of FDI in Infrastructure of India
The Infrastructure in India is not sufficient for the growth of the nation. Fearing this, the government has decided to attract the foreign investment. The main concern is to bring the FII in the infrastructure. But the scenario is that there is no such clear cut FID policy and the policy is very confusing for investors. It is important to have proper FIDA policy in place.
FDI – The Scenarios in different Infrastructure
Telecom: The Telecom sector has opened for FIE. 100% FIDE has been allowed in Telecom. All the licenses issued after 1995 are FIES. In telecom, FIO is allowed only to the existing licensees. For FIC, all the services are allowed. Foreign investors can invest 26% in telecom. Telecom Sector is growing very fast as the population is increasing day by day, but there should be proper planning and strategy in all these sectors. This is the major concern of this",497,194

This study aims to identify the main characteristics of foreign investments of firms from Indian origin and to analyze the determinants of their involvement in infrastructural activities. This study also aims at highlighting how foreign investment from India impacts the development of infrastructure in partner countries. Our analysis uses a panel of developing and developing economies. The main results of the study are twofold. At the macro-economic level, it appears that the level of development has a significant impact on infrastructure development. Furthermore, the presence of FDI from the developing world does not affect the infrastructure of partner developing states.
