I will start by talking about disability in general as a disability is a condition which impairs one’s ability to perform the functions of life. “Disability” has been defined by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: Disability is an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations, restrictions of participation and other aberrations that result in barriers that prevent the achievement of the fullest potential of individuals. In fact, a study of more than 2,700 adults with disabilities showed that people who have experienced a significant disability before age 22 have a lower likelihood of employment as young adults compared to those who experienced their disability at a later age. I will talk about the intersection of gender, caste and disability.

But the real issue is to what extent it is a “growth” economy, in which the productive capacity and the income levels of the people are growing. In 2003-04 the average growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was 5.9 per cent. This was slightly below the growth rate achieved in 2011-12. If the GDP growth had been 6 per

The main factors of the current slowdown were the following:
- The growth rates of capital formation and private and public consumption were significantly weaker than previously expected;
india’s economy
This is due to a slowdown in private investment, in particular in the infrastructure sector; in turn, a decline in investment led to the growth of industrial production and the production of intermediate goods. The decline also affected the demand for energy and intermediate raw materials, which led (at the same time) to lower exports, lower investment and consumption of households. At the macroeconomic level, the slowdown was exacerbated by the negative impact of global developments. For example, exports were negatively affected, and investment by foreign. This was due in part to an increase in protectionism, especially in – in this case the countries of",4,185

Indian economy,the sustainability of trade deficits in the presence of endogenous structural breaks: evidence from the indian economy,"the sustainability of trade deficits in the presence of endogenous structural breaks: evidence from the indian economy, 1979-2007
AbstractWe examine how sustainable are the trade balance deficits of the Indian economy using the standard unit root test and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. We find evidence of structural break in India's real trade balances in both the short-term and long-terms. A break appears to be associated with the introduction of economic reforms in 1991 and also with a rise in oil prices during the mid-1990s. These results imply that the sustainability hypothesis that has been used to argue for liberalization in other developing countries is not applicable to India. The results also suggest that trade liberalizations, such as the WTO negotiations, may have been delayed because of concerns about the long run sustainability (2008)

Abstract
This study investigates the energy dynamics in India between 1980 and 2006. A co 2 emissions equation is constructed based on the neoclassical growth model and energy balance theory. The model is tested for the entire period for robustness and the results are then used as inputs to a computable general equilibrium (cge) model. We find a close correspondence between the model outputs and those of the cge model as regards energy demand, energy intensity and co and n
emissions, which are estimated from the co-emission equation. However, there are significant differences in the pattern of economic development. In the first stage of analysis, we compare the different economic paths that have been followed. Finally, in a second stage, policy scenarios are simulated to show the",11,182

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of India' s economic reforms on its middle and upper middle classes (UMCs). It argues that the political significance of both groups is underestimated in the literature and that their interests are likely to play an important role in shaping India's political future. The paper first discusses the origins and characteristics of the UMCs as a social group in India. It then examines recent trends in household income distribution and consumption in order to assess whether the middle- and -upper middle – classes have grown in importance in recent decades, and how they are distributed across the country. Next, it examines how the growth of these groups affected the nature of political competition and conflict, in particular the rise of caste-based and class- oriented politics. This is followed by an analysis of how economic policy has shifted from one based on ""command and control"" to one emphasizing competition, markets and liberalizing policies. In",13,198

Abstract (Summary)This paper analyses the growth experience of different industrial sectors and regions of India since 1970 using an input-output model. We also examine the contribution of each sector to the total output growth during the recent period. The model provides an explanation for the uneven distribution of income within the country and among different regions. While the share of agriculture in total employment has been declining, in terms of output contribution it has remained constant. In addition, while agricultural productivity has risen, output share in agriculture has declined. It is also observed from the model that the manufacturing sub-sector has contributed the maximum to both growth and employment in India. Among regions, Maharashtra has emerged as the most productive state in both absolute and relative terms in all the years since the early 1960s, with Tamil Nadu second.

Shocks to economic Growth - A case Study of India

V.Vipin Kumar
Abstract
This research paper analyzes the economic effect of the shocks to the Indian economy on its growth during the period 1956- 2008. In order to achieve this objective, various data series such as GDP data, inflation data etc. were used. It has been observed from the time series of GDP that the economy has faced a negative shock to growth due to various reasons. However the effect due the negative shocks has not been significant. The analysis also showed that a rise in inflation has led to a reduction in economic activity in India. Thus in order not to face the impact of negative growth shocks and to increase the rate of growth in the near future, the government has to reduce the level of inflation in a sustainable manner. Further it has also been noticed that India has experienced negative external shocks. Due",15,188

However, this plan was not enough to solve the problems facing the society and economy. So the second liberalization, which took place in January 2021 was necessary.

In the early nineties, the Indian macroeconomic environment was characterized by a low growth rate, high inflation, and a large fiscal deficit. In an attempt to revive the economy and improve macro-economic management, a number of structural reforms have been initiated and the macro management of economy has undergone significant changes since 1991 with the initiation of economic reforms. The reforms are based on a liberalized trade regime and opening to foreign investment, reduction of government intervention, improved governance and transparency in economic management. It has improved macro stability and reduced volatility in growth. Since the reforms of early 90’s, Indian growth performance has also improved and",24,194

In the model the total health expenditure of a country is divided into two components namely the direct costs incurred on the treatment of patients and loss of productivity of healthy people.

Indian economy,the indian economic success: a challenge to some race relations assumptions,"the indian economic success: a challenge to some race relations assumptions
The Indian economy is on track to become the fourth largest in the world and its economic growth is the fastest of all emerging markets. This paper examines why this is so. We argue that two factors are most important: the rapid increase in India's stock of knowledge - the result of an educational investment programme that was begun in 1973 [1] and the adoption in that same year of a'market friendly' macro-economic policy. These two features have led to rapid growth of the manufacturing sector, and with this growth has come a rise in productivity and a substantial increase is labour skills. The second part of this paper discusses the implications of these developments for a race-relations theory of economic development. Our analysis of Indian data indicates that the increase of India in economic performance and labour productivity has taken place at the expense of labour and income shares of China. While this suggests that India is not on a similar path to East Asia, the data also indicate that,",33,198

The paper analyzes the evidence on the economic impact of industrial policies in India by using a new methodology that does not rely on standard productivity decompositions. The analysis is based on a newly constructed panel of firm-level data from 1978 to 1990 for manufacturing, and 1981-1992 for services. Using a ""non-parametrized"" approach for estimating the productivity equation, a strong and statistically significant decline in the manufacturing sector is found. This decline is more pronounced and longer lasting in services, but it is not statistically different from the decline found in manufacturing. However, in a second stage of estimation, the effects of economic reform on efficiency are also estimated. In both manufacturing (for 2-digit SIC) and Services ((for the ISIC4-classification of 7-digits), the reforms are found to increase efficiency",38,181

Abstract
This article explores the impact of public policies on the technological change in Indian agriculture since independence. It argues that India's agriculture has been characterised by a “dual technological structure” - a combination of imported and indigenous technologies. In spite of significant state intervention in agriculture, this dual structure remained intact. The article traces the emergence of this structure and its consequences. A new model of agricultural development, based largely on imported technologies, was introduced from the early 1960s. However, the state continued to play a crucial role in the development of the agricultural extension system, which promoted the adoption of new technologies by small farmers. This model proved incapable of providing a sustainable development path, however, as it was based on an unsustainable pattern of production which relied heavily on external inputs. As a result, by the mid-1990, India had become highly vulnerable to international fluctuations in agricultural prices",39,189
Indian economy,what determines indian economic success?: evidence from tribal and individual indian enterprises,"what determines indian economic success?: evidence from tribal and individual indian enterprises
In this paper, we investigate why tribal enterprises are more successful than individual enterprises in the Indian economy, which is characterized by a high degree of informality. We show that tribal enterprise success is driven by two main factors: the tribal identity and the social networks that are formed among tribal members. Our analysis, based on a sample of tribal firms and on the individual-level data of the NSSO Household Survey, suggests that the success of a tribal firm is a function of its membersâ€™ social interactions. In the case of individual firms, the level of success depends on its ability to create social and business links. The analysis suggests a mechanism through which social network effects might explain the observed tribal-individual enterprise gap in India.

Ans:
The Indian economy has been in the process of a gradual transition from a planned to a market economy - a shift from command to competition. This is the most significant and important change that has transformed the economy in a post-independence period. The process is gradual as the Indian state is still the dominant force in determining the direction of the economic policy, and the state remains the major employer in both the public and private sector. As the transition takes place the market and state continue to operate in parallel, but with increasing convergence. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between the two and also to appreciate the differences between them as this will help in understanding their respective roles and functions.. For example, the government continues to intervene in markets for the sake of price stability, to promote",45,200

In this context it is important to point out that the government has been trying to provide some support by providing a loan at subsidized rate of interest of 3 percent. This is the main reason why the number of SMEs in India has increased over the years. [11] In India, the growth of Small and Micro Enterprises can be linked to the development of a number a small scale industries. As a result, they can also help in reducing the unemployment level as it provides more employment opportunities to many. The government of India is also working on the policy of encouraging SMEs through various programs. It is believed that if the SMEs grow, then India will develop faster and more efficiently. SMEs provide the employment in the unorganized and informal manufacturing sector. Small scale sector is not only providing jobs but it also provides employment to millions of people who can earn their livelihood from this sector and this is very important for a developing nation like India.

This study is the first one to provide a rigorous analysis of the relationship between Indian trade reforms and economic performance. It uses a new data set on India, based on trade data at the sector, state and firm levels, covering all sectors and the entire economy. The results reveal that while Indian manufacturing has grown relatively fast after the reforms, there is no clear evidence that services have benefited, and that the growth rate of Indian exports has been slower after reform. These results are robust to a number of alternative measures of liberalisation.

The rural sector has been a major component of the Indian economy, contributing significantly in its growth and development. It also provides a large share of employment (about 50% of India’s total workforce) and has a great potential to contribute to economic growth.
India’ s rural economy is characterized by a high degree of self-reliance and a strong emphasis on self help. The rural people are very dependent on the land for their livelihood and thus have developed a very high level of knowledge of farming practices, which they are able to pass on to their children. In addition, the rural areas tend to be more stable than urban areas, where economic and political upheavals are common. This stability is due to the high rate of fertility which ensures a continuing supply of workers and the fact that there are less social and economic barriers preventing people from participating in economic activities. As such rural India is seen as a source of labour",53,188

The emergence of a large industrial workforce in British India was the most dramatic and significant feature of the economic development of South Asia at the turn of 20th century. It had an important political, social and economic impact on the region in the period. This paper examines this process of industrialisation by focusing specifically on two dimensions of it, the emergence or growth of wage labour, and the impact of that growth on rural India. The paper traces the growth in wage employment in India’s urban areas as a result of growth and expansion of industry and argues that the labour market for urban wage labourers was a product of economic processes in which the rural areas were only indirectly involved. Thus, while wage workers and urban employment were important indicators of urbanisation, it must be understood that these changes did not occur in isolation from the rest of Indian society.

These reforms have resulted in a greater number of companies coming into the capital markets for raising of resources. During this period, various factors, namely, economic growth and liberalization, had been playing their role in changing the pattern of growth of Indian Capital market.

Abstract
In the context of the global economy, India is a major destination for foreign direct investment, especially in the manufacturing sector. However, the rapid growth of this industry has not benefited the labour force in terms of higher wages, better working conditions and job security. In fact, labour in India, as elsewhere in South Asia, remains relatively undervalued and under-employed. The current industrial and economic policies have been shaped by the dominant global market-oriented ideology. As a result, workers are often seen only in economic and political terms. This paper focuses on one of India`s most vulnerable sectors, namely, textiles and clothing, to demonstrate how the state has been unable to protect the interests of workers and ensure decent employment.",68,181

The first stage of an economic system (in the case of a developing country, as in India today) is that which depends on the external market for its raw material. During this stage, which we call the ‘pre-industrialisation’ stage, the economic activities are confined to production of food, fodder and furs for the market. The raw materials are drawn from the land and from other natural resources like forests, water sources and the like.
This stage is also called as the primary stage because here the main concern of the people was to survive and there was very little attention to the growth and development of economic activity. This is why the level of technological development in this pre- industrial stage was at a very low level. There was a heavy dependence on nature for food and other resources.",69,200

Indian economy,macroeconomic adjustments in a developing economy: a medium term model of outputs and prices in india,"macroeconomic adjustments in a developing economy: a medium term model of outputs and prices in india
Macroeconomic Adjustment in developing economies is a function of the structural, political, and institutional environment as well as macroeconomic policy and the external environment. The structural and political environment are not static, but they change over time. As such, the adjustment to a macroecological shock (an external shock) depends on the time period in which the shock occurred.
This study analyzes the effects of macro-economic shocks on macroeco- nomic variables and macro adjustments for the period 1950-1999 in India. This time frame was selected due to the availability of data. Macro variables were analyzed in the form of their deviations. These deviations were decomposed into its three components-real exchange rate, price level, GDP, in order to identify its source. A structural break model is employed to detect the turning points and to estimate the parameters. Real exchange rates, prices, real GDP and output, all have significant and",84,187

This study examines the effect of international acquisition of Indian companies by foreign companies on value creation for acquiring firms. The results show that acquisitions create value for foreign firms and are significantly more profitable. This paper also finds that the acquisition method has an impact on the value of the target: (1) cross-border takeovers are more effective than domestic mergers and acquisitions and ; () the use of equity as a payment medium in the transaction does not have any effect on shareholder wealth but is associated with a higher probability of a successful deal and higher profitability; and, finally, that a deal's success is not associated:1999.",85,182

The Portuguese began to trade in this area and established a factory at Malacca in the Malay Peninsula. The most important commodity exported was pepper - a red, pungent spice that is produced from dried berries of the piper vine, which grows wild in many parts of Asia. In 1540, he sent a second expedition to establish trade contacts with southern India. A new era of trade with Europe was opened and the Indian Ocean became a focus of European trade and power in Asia and Africa. As a result of this change in policy, the Portuguese were able to expand their influence over a much wider area, and eventually became the dominant sea-faring power of Europe. It also meant an increase in trade opportunities for the Europeans. 1 The Portuguese established trading posts in India to gain access to spices, but it was only after the establishment of a direct maritime contact with the east that trade between Europe",89,190

The Indian economy is in its nascent stages of economic development. The per capita GDP has increased from Rs. 8,000 in 1951 to Rs 50, 000/- in year 2000. In other words, its growth has been very fast in last 5 decades, but in real terms, it is not so much because of the population growth rate. India has an average growth of 2.8% per annum since 1942 to 1996.
During the last decade of last century, there were a number of macroeconomic problems like:
• Balance of payments problems. Due to the increasing capital flight and the rising trade deficit, the balance of payment problems became serious. As a result, India was forced to seek the assistance of IMF. This has a negative impact on the economic stability of a country. It is also a major cause of capital market volatility.

Abstract:
This study investigates the nexus between government size (measured as public expenditure and public debt-to-GDP) and Economic Growth (% GDP) for India between the period 1970-1971 to 2017-18. We have used panel cointegration technique to find long-term relationship between two variables. This study finds a positive long term relationship, which indicates there is a cointegrating relationship exist between Government Size Index and GDP for the study period. Our results imply that Government expenditure is an important component of the economy and it is positively associated with the economic development of a country in the sense that the expenditure helps the development process. The results of Granger-Causality tests also support the long run and short run causal relationships. In other words, the results suggest that an increase in expenditure by the government is the result of economic and development in a given year and",96,192

Abstract
An attempt has been made here to examine the long term impact of carbon emissions on economic growth in developing countries using the cointegration methodology with vector error correction model to test the hypothesis on the short and long run relationships between energy consumption, carbon emission and economic performance. The empirical findings suggest that there exists a long –run relationship between CO2 emission (em) and real GDP / capita, and between the level of CO 2 emissions and energy consumed in India. Moreover, the results suggest the importance of trade in promoting economic development and growth, particularly for a developing economy like India that has a very high level trade to GDP ratio.",97,186

About 40% of India’s population live in rural areas. The Indian economy is highly rural and agricultural oriented. Most rural households are engaged in nonfarm activities, especially agricultural laborers. There has been an ongoing process of migration of rural workers to towns and cities over several decades, but the share of the rural population in the total population has remained high.
The share in total exports of manufactured and value-added services in 2007-08 was 9%, up from 3.9% in fiscal 1999-00. This has increased with the global demand for Indian products.

The project investigates the impact of globalisation on policy formulation in India and the role of the state vis-a-vis the global economy. It explores the ways in which India has sought to manage its growing relationship with the rest of world.
It will examine how Indian policymakers have sought ‘nationalist’ ways of responding to challenges posed by global economic integration. The research aims to analyse the policies and strategies adopted to protect domestic producers, and their impact on the development of India’s industries, agriculture, manufacturing and trade. In addition, it will investigate how India uses its role and voice within the international economic system to promote its interests. This includes, in particular, the question as to the extent to which economic globalism (or 'globalisation') has led to increased regional integration in South Asia or to greater economic fragmentation in global South.",103,191

We will begin the course with a discussion of the historical roots of India's development problem. The first week we will discuss the colonial economy, which created a deep and lasting legacy of inequities that persist in modern India. During the second week, we turn to the postcolonial state. This week will address the major political economy reforms initiated by Indira Gandhi in 1971 and 1991 in order to combat the legacy. In Week 3, the focus shifts to a consideration of contemporary debates on the role of globalization in exacerbating India’s economic and social problems (or, conversely, in providing an opportunity for economic growth and equity).

Abstract
India is an open economy which is dependent on exports as the share of imports in its GDP is 12.5% and 16.2% in the current and future year respectively. India’s share in world trade has been continuously increasing and is now at the 10th place after overtaking UK and Germany. It is interesting to note that Indian exports were only 1% of the world exports in 2000 which increased to 2.3% at current prices in year 2015. In spite of this growth there has not been enough attention given to the exports. The main aim of any economy is to improve the standard of living of its people and exports help in achieving that goal by creating employment opportunities and providing foreign exchange which can be used for import of capital goods.",105,187

The impact of the decision by the Government of India to demonitise high-value currency notes in November 2016 on Indian economy has been the subject of extensive discussions and analyses in the Indian media and academic circles. While there has not yet been sufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusion, a few facts and trends, based on publicly available data, suggest that the economic impact so far has largely been negative. In particular, there appears to be a sharp decline in bank deposits, and this is likely to translate into further contraction in credit to the private sector. These developments are also affecting the overall economic growth and the fiscal deficit of both the central government as well as state governments. Further, the recent decline, which was sharper than anticipated, in exports has also adversely affected foreign exchange reserves. The impact is further compounded by a rise in global oil prices. This has led to an increase in overall",114,180

AbstractThe Indian economy is growing at a fast pace and is expected to reach a per capita income of more than $2,000 by 2015. In spite of its rapid economic growth, the unemployment problem of India is a major concern in the recent times. The Indian unemployment rates are high and rising despite the fact that the economy has expanded by more and more employment opportunities. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to study the relationship between economic and employment growth in India, in an effort to ascertain the factors that are responsible for the increase in unemployment in Indian labour force and the impact of these factors on India’s economy.
The study uses a panel data set of 20 Indian states to investigate the determinants of unemployment, and it also studies the effect of economic activity and government’ policy initiatives on the growth of employment, during a period of time from 1981 to 2007. It is also an investigation into the extent",122,190

We investigate the sources of India' s rapid economic and population growth using total productivity, which includes the contributions from labor, capital, and the natural resource base. We use a production function that includes capital inputs, labor inputs and natural resources. Our model is estimated for two decades, 1951-80 and 1981 - 99 using annual data for a panel of 15 states in India. The results show that the share of growth in the capital-natural resource-labor input product (K) is 0.7% of GDP, while the labor-capital product is equal to 4.0% and total product to about 3.4%, implying that growth was mostly driven by capital and not labor. In both samples we find that a large share in growth of total output came from the contribution of labor and capital. Capital- and labor productivity have contributed ",123,183

The foreign capital inflows to emerging markets in the current decade have been substantial and the impact on the domestic economy is not clear. The impact is likely to be greater than in developed countries due to several factors. First, the developing countries are in a process of rapid growth and have high savings rates and hence, a higher multiplier for capital. Second, capital account liberalization has been a major factor, making the emerging economy capital accounts more transparent and stable. Third, many of the countries that have received significant capital flows also have large domestic markets, which are relatively less affected by the influx of capital from abroad.

Indian economy,"the estimation of the cointegration relationship between growth, domestic investment and exports: the indian economy","the estimation of the cointegration relationship between growth, domestic investment and exports: the indian economy
This study investigates the relationship of exports, investment, and growth in the Indian economy, in order to assess the impact of changes in these variables to the growth of output in an effort to estimate the long-term equilibrium relationship among exports growth and investment growth. We find strong evidence that these two variables move together in a long run and a strong correlation. Moreover, the export-growth-investment correlation is positive and statistically significant. However, these results are subject to change in short run. The export growth has a positive impact on domestic demand and, consequently, on investment. Investment has an effect on growth both direct and indirect. In addition, our empirical results show the presence of a significant longterm correlation between export and domestic.

The economic slowdown is now well over six months old and the Indian economy is at the cusp of a critical juncture. There are three broad scenarios that could materialize. The first scenario is the worst of them - a collapse of the government and a return to political chaos. This will be a disaster for the economy as it will mean a loss of credibility and confidence among foreign and domestic investors. A government collapse would also mean the end of all the reforms that have taken place in recent years and an immediate return of protectionism and cronyism. If this is avoided the second scenario, which is not as bad as the first one, may emerge. Under this scenario the current government may survive, but its ability to push through the needed structural reforms may be severely",134,182

Introduction:
Economic analysis has been a neglected subject in India in the past. A number of reasons account for this state of affairs. One, economic analyses of the Indian type, which could be used for the purpose of policy making, were not produced. There was a dearth of trained economists who could write on India. The other reason was the political economy of India which was in its formative stage. This meant that it had been the subject of much debate but had not yet crystallised as the science of economic development which it has since acquired. Finally, there has, in fact been an intellectual resistance to the study of economics in general and Indian economy in particular.

The Impact Of Inflation On The Indian Stock Market. 3.5 Impact on Economic Growth The main purpose of this research is to study the impact inflation and real interest rate on macro economic variables. However, the government should not be blamed for rising prices. This is because inflation will cause a rise in prices for most consumers and will thus reduce the purchasing power. Inflation is one important tool for monetary policy in a country and its impact is a vital area of investigation for economists and policy makers. A rise or fall in inflation is the change in the level of overall prices, which is measured in terms of a basket of goods and services.

Abstract
The nineteenth-century transformation of India’s economy, as the “crisis” and the emergence of new forms of capitalism are often described, has long been recognized as one of the most significant economic developments of its period. The growth of industrial production and commercial activity, the expansion of foreign trade, and above all, agricultural transformation, are seen as fundamental in the process. This chapter will examine some issues involved in interpreting the nature and significance of these trends. These issues arise out of a consideration of their social context: the changing structure of society and of class relations, in particular. It will be argued that these transformations are best seen both as consequences and as agents of change in India, which in turn is best interpreted as an integral part of nineteenth and twentieth- century capitalism.",146,193

Abstract
The paper examines the nexuses between carbon emission and economic output for India. The empirical results indicate strong relationship between CO2 emissions and output in the long run and short run. A long-run cointegrating relation and a short-term cointegrated relation exist between the variables. In longrun, the carbon intensity is the only variable that has significant impact on COE and the co-integrators of COI, COII and COIII are not significant. However, in short term there are two variables, carbon and carbon dioxide, which have significant effects on output. Moreover, there is a positive feedback between economic activities and pollution.

This study aims at analyzing the relationship between crude Oil price change, real GDP growth and Real Interest rate change with inflation. We also investigate the effects of crude price, Real GDP and interest rate changes on India's Inflation rate. To achieve the purpose, Structural VAR method is adopted. The results indicate that there is an unidirectional and negative relationship among crude, interest rates and real economic output. Also we have found that an increase in real interest leads to the growth of Inflation. Moreover, the results also confirm the fact that inflationary expectations play an important role in inflation and output growth, and the effect is stronger for inflation in India. Therefore, a decrease in the real rate of interest and a rise in oil prices are the two major factors behind inflation: 109-119

The book examines the political process of macroeconomic policy change, from the time the Congress Party came to power in March 1947 until the fall of the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1990. This time covers the 34 years of Indira Gandhi’s first term in office, which is generally considered as having been the most successful in terms of economic development. During this period, the Indian economy experienced a series of major macro-economic shocks that affected the growth rates and inflation levels. Despite these shocks, India maintained an average annual rate of growth of 4.6 percent over the whole period. The first major shock was brought about by the Sino-Indian war of August 1971, followed by a sharp devaluation of India’S currency in July 1980, and a subsequent rise in interest rates in September / October, when inflation reached its",157,184

The Indian Banking Industry was nationalised in 1969. Insurance sector is the 5th largest industry contributing to the country’s GDP. The insurance companies have to pay a part of their income to LIC. This is a very good thing because it has a direct link to India’ s economic growth. … This was one of India's largest privatization. In order to meet growing demand in the financial services sector, it is estimated that the industry will require 4,00,000 people by 2018. There is an increasing trend in terms of penetration of motor insurance and non-life insurance. It is also important that we look at some of its drawbacks. For example, an insurance policy that has not been renewed for five years would be cancelled and the insured would then lose the benefits of having taken the policy in first place.

Indian economy,interfuel substitution in the indian economy,"interfuel substitution in the indian economy
In this paper we present a model of interfuel substitute- tion. We analyze the conditions for a switch between a low- and a high-price fuel, which is motivated by the introduction of a second fuel into an otherwise fuel-monopoly economy in order to achieve an inter- fuel substitution, and we discuss its possible effects on welfare in an oligopolistic context. Our main result is that the model predicts a reduction of total consumption and of the share of high price fuel for low income households. However, for high income groups the substitution reduces total fuel consumption but it increases the shares of both fuels. The model also shows that fuel switching can be beneficial if it is preceded by a price increase. Finally, in contrast to the previous literature, we prove that in a monopoly the second price of oil and gas can increase welfare: 127-137

Indian economy,sustaining superior performance in an emerging economy: an empirical test in the indian context,"sustaining superior performance in an emerging economy: an empirical test in the indian context
This paper empirically analyses the impact of organizational and contextual determinants on sustainable superior firm performance. The analysis is based on the data gathered through a survey of the top management of 200 companies from India. Using a multi-group path analysis, this study provides empirical evidence that the organizational variables – such as firm size, age, and growth rates (measured by the percentage growth in sales and profit during the last five years) -- are important determinants of superior firms’ sustainable growth. Further, the study also finds that external and internal contextual factors - such a country’s macroeconomic and industry growth & productivity, firm’ s access to capital, market size and intensity of rivalry ― have a significant impact on superior sustainable firm growth performance as well as on firm's growth and profitability.

Indian economy,demonetisation 2016 and its impact on indian economy and taxation,"demonetisation 2016 and its impact on indian economy and taxation
Demonetisation is a step toward the elimination of black money. It would not be an exaggeration to say that demonetization is going to be a game changer for India. The objective behind the decision to demonitize notes of Rs. 500 and Rs 1000 was to curb the practice of Black Money.
The decision of demonisation was taken after long discussions and deliberations in the parliament. In fact the idea of bringing black economy into the tax net was a vision of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had spoken about it even before his election and has been working for its successful implementation since his first tenure. But the implementation of this vision had become a matter of great debate. There were strong voices opposing it as it would affect the daily transactions of people. However, the PM and his team was convinced about its benefits. Finally the government took the bold step of making the move a reality. As a result of these decisions a new set",174,193

We use data of industrial growth, investment, savings, income and population for India between 1947 and 2007 to examine the role of investment in economic growth. We find that investment growth is a major contributor to sustained growth in output. Investment growth of 1% is found to lead to 0.2% rise in GDP, and the contribution of private investment to GDP has been much higher since 1960s than it was before. While the rate of growth has fluctuated, the level of savings has increased from 20% to about 30% of output over this period, with savings increasing significantly in the 1990: 49-58

Indian economy,measuring energy efficiency in the context of an emerging economy: the case of indian manufacturing,"measuring energy efficiency in the context of an emerging economy: the case of indian manufacturing industry
The paper studies energy and labour productivity in Indian manufacturing industries, and their relationship. This relationship is studied for various sectors, over the period 2001-2006, using the Balassa-Samuelson effect, energy productivity and energy labour ratio. The findings indicate that a positive, significant and increasing relationship exists between energy usage and productivity for the entire Indian economy. In addition, the relationship between the energy use and output is found to be more significant in case -of manufacturing sectors than in primary sector, while for both manufacturing and primary sectors it is negative at the early stage of development, but turns positive after a lag of 3-5 years. For a sub-set of manufacturing sector the impact of productivity is significantly higher than energy. However, in energy the impacts of labour and capital are more substantial, especially in manufacturing, than that of energy: 125-141

Indian economy,economic liberalisation and indian agriculture: a statewise analysis,"economic liberalisation and indian agriculture: a statewise analysis using rabi cropping data
The paper investigates the impact of agricultural liberalization in the Indian economy. Using state-level data covering the pre-liberalization and post-liberization periods for major crops, the study examines whether the benefits of liberalizations in terms of higher growth and employment are being fully realized by different states or if they are concentrated in particular regions. We find that the growth of gross value added (GVA) per worker is significantly associated with agricultural reform measures, implying that agricultural growth is being stimulated by policy reforms; however, it is not uniform across states. This is corroborated by the results of the regression of GVA per farmer on agricultural reforms, which show that reforms have not significantly increased the productivity of farmers. The results are robust to the inclusion of state dummies in different regressions. In general, agricultural policies in India have been more liberalized in states with relatively higher levels of industrial",185,188

It is time to take stock of how well the fiscal consolidation process has progressed over the past three years. There are three main factors that need to be assessed. The first is the progress on fiscal deficit; the second are the steps to improve tax collection; and third – the measures to reduce government borrowing.

The study is based on the data for 1981-2009 from 24 countries. We examine the long-run relationship between the growth of energy demand, GDP and CO2 emissions using the cointegration technique and the Granger’s Causality test. The long run relationship among variables is found to be weak (in the range -0.15 to 0.14). The Granger Causal test also finds no causal relationship either in the weak or strong direction, except for the case of India.

Future Ready Banking with Smart Contracts
With blockchain and cryptocurrencies making the news almost daily, one of the key areas where blockchain is gaining ground is smart contract technology.
What is a smart Contract?
A smart-contract is an agreement between two or more parties that is executed automatically, without the involvement of a third party. In a nutshell, it’s a piece of code which automatically executes when certain conditions are met. It’ll perform actions automatically (pay a sum of money, for instance) without a human to intervene. This makes the smart agreement extremely cost effective and efficient. Smart-Contracts were introduced by the Bitcoin blockchain as a way to execute transactions automatically. Since then, the concept of smart agreements has been expanded into different fields like healthcare and education. A typical example is the application of blockchain in the healthcare sector for the purpose of sharing health related data between multiple stakeholders. The blockchain has the potential to transform a large range of industries",196,194

Published on 2010-07-12T14:53:05Z (GMT) by
A framework to explain the paradox of persistent poverty in India is proposed. The framework is based on four key factors: the level of income inequality within states, the distribution of public expenditure across states in rural India, and the extent of fiscal autonomy of states. We argue that the low level in the income distribution in states and low levels of inter-state public transfers in most Indian states are major causes for high poverty.

Indian economy,"diversification, propping and monitoring: business groups, firm performance and the indian economic transition","diversification, propping and monitoring: business groups, firm performance and the indian economic transition in the post-indeped
AbstractThe Indian economy has experienced dramatic economic transformation in recent years, moving from centrally controlled and regulated industries to a more market-based, competitive economy. This paper examines how firm behaviour and performance have changed during this period of rapid transition. Using data from the Business Group Survey Panel of the Reserve Bank of India, we find that firms belonging to the same group tend to be similar in terms of diversification, capital intensity and firm size. We find some evidence that the diversification behaviour of firms varies across the groups. The data also suggest that groups have responded to increased competition by increasing investment in capital goods and by diversifying into newer and more productive industries. However, despite these improvements in performance, many firms are not able to maintain their competitiveness. (05)

- Category Business
The impact of the goods and service tax on the economy of India can be analyzed by the following factors;
Impact on economic activities-
GST is an indirect tax levied on goods (except alcohol and tobacco) and is a consumption tax. It is paid by consumers at the point of final consumption, and thus the burden does not fall entirely on producers. This makes it easier for the government to collect.
As an effect, it reduces tax evasion, since tax collection is not based on physical delivery. Also, as it is levying on a product rather than a person, there are more chances of it being collected. However, the collection of GST is also dependent on how well the administration of tax works. If the system is corrupt, tax avoidance is quite possible. Hence, GST may not be as good for tax revenue",220,180

Oil price shock and its impacts on economy of a country is an important phenomenon in the world of economics. In the present research, we have studied and analyzed the effect of oil price volatility shocks and oil-exporting-country shocks in a dynamic setting using the Markov regression models. Our findings indicate that the oil exporters have been experiencing the volatility in oil prices as compared to that of exporters of other major commodities. The oil export economy is more vulnerable to shocks of commodity prices. We have also found that shocks to the prices of non-oil exporting countries, especially the ones with high per capita income, are significantly higher than that to oil exporting ones. Thus, the policy makers should focus more on the non oil sector.

1. The nature of data - The first problem that faces us is the availability or lack of availability of reliable data. Even in developed countries, the data may not be completely reliable due to the inherent problems associated with data collection and recording in developing countries and also due the fact that the labour force in these nations is not adequately represented by the official records. It would be very useful to have a reliable source for the collection of such data in countries like India. There is, however, an urgent need to develop such a source. Until then, we must make do with the available data and estimate the parameters as best we can, even when the estimates are not entirely satisfactory due partly to inadequate data quality",230,185

Indian economy,growth cycles in the indian economy,"growth cycles in the indian economy
The Indian economy has undergone several phases of growth and recession throughout its 66 year history. The first phase of economic growth in India started with the beginning of the independence movement. In the 1950s the economy was growing by about 5.0% per year, but the country's per capita income remained low because the population was still large.
As India grew, its population grew as well. By the end of this phase, the Indian population had grown to 300 million in 1960. During this period, India' economy grew at a moderate rate. But the growth was not sustainable because of India’s lack of natural resources, and the government had to take various initiatives to boost the economic development and growth. It was only after 1970, that the rate of GDP (GDP per person) grew by 10 times to about USD 500. India continued to grow at this rate for almost two decades, until it was forced to cut its",234,200

This paper analyses the role of two different factors - distance and socio-economic status of households -- on the decision to use public health facilities in India. The analysis focuses mainly on three states where large sample surveys exist. Using the Demographic and Health Surveys 2012 for 22 states, this study estimates the probability of institutional delivery and its determinants — distance, economic characteristics of the household and health characteristics. Results suggest that distance does matter, but the effects are not uniform across all the states. While the distance from the home to the delivery site has a negative effect on institutional deliveries, the same does not hold for the quality of care at the facility or maternal and foetal health. In fact, it is the socio economic conditions of rural India that seem to be driving decisions to deliver at home or at public facilities.

This thesis investigates the effects of slavery on the economic productivity of British colonies during the early 19th Century. It examines how the British abolitionists of Slavery in 1833 affected the West Indian economy. The research uses a historical macroeconomic framework of growth. Data is sourced mainly from secondary sources. Using a time-series analysis, I find that the growth rate of GDP per head and per worker increased after abolition. Moreover, the per capita GDP, which was lower than that of Britain in every decade since 1800, grew significantly to catch up with Britain’s by the end of 1900. In 1840 the annual real output of West India per adult was 30 percent lower relative to Britain. By the year 2000 West Indies had caught up and overt",240,194

The growth of the Indian economy is well documented in the popular media.

There is no doubt that the growth rate has been very high, averaging over 6% between 2003 and 2010, and has exceeded the rate achieved in most other large countries.
However, this growth has not been evenly distributed between different sections of society and between areas of production within the domestic economy. For example, there has long been an ‘East-West regional inequality gap’ in India.

India’s economy has grown at a very rapid rate over the last decade, but this has not been matched by the development of other areas. In the early 1990’S there was a lot of talk about India’ s development, and how India had a chance of becoming as strong as Japan. The Indian economy was growing at over 7 percent per year, it had very good exports to the USA, Europe, UK and other major markets, the Indian stock markets were doing well and foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was increasing.
This all seemed very promising, until the financial crisis of the late 80’ S and early nineties hit. There was talk of India being a new tigers and that there would be an economic revolution in Asia. But India suffered just the same as the rest of Asia did. It took the Asian countries a long time",256,181

In India the number of infected cases of Covid-19 is growing at a rate of about 1000 per day. It may take another four months to get to a stage where the virus has run its course. If the rate continues at the same level, we may get close to 500,000 cases by the time the crisis has subsided. We are in for a very long haul, which will continue for at least another year with all kinds of economic disruptions and a deep recession to be expected.
As the disease spreads across the country, it will spread across social strata and age groups. The impact of an economic slowdown will be felt by all stratas of society. While the middle and lower classes are likely to suffer more than the higher middle class or the wealthy, the rich and upper middle classes too would be affected by a slowdown. They would suffer in terms of employment opportunities and in the prices of their assets. However, they will not suffer as much as the poor",261,200

Abstract
The Indian economy is witnessing an economic boom after the liberalization of its economy in 1990. The country is moving ahead towards a knowledge-based society. It is also moving towards the globalization and liberalized economy, which will require a skilled and educated workforce. In this context, India is experiencing a major challenge to provide the much needed employment to its growing population, especially in agriculture. Agricultural labor is facing the problem of declining labor supply due to the changing demographic pattern of labor, changing attitude to work and increasing educational levels of rural youth. This research project has focused on the issue of agricultural labor in Indian agriculture, more specifically on how to improve the productivity of Indian agricultural workforce, and how the cooperative movement can contribute to it.

This paper empirically analyzes whether the FDI and trade-openness affect Economic Growth (Eg) in India. Using annual data on Fdi and total trade for 1980-2008, and a standard production function – with the use of Cobb-Douglas function, the paper estimates the relationship between economic open-ness and growth through the standard cointegration technique. The findings suggest that economic openness has a significant long run and transitory effect on growth in Indian context. This study shows that, a 10 percentage point increase in Fii inflows is associated with a rise of 0.25% in annual GDP growth.

THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF INDIA UNDER THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
(1)
I. Introduction
Since the establishment of British hegemony in India in 1858, the country has been passing through a period of transition, from the traditional social and economic system to the modern industrial society. The process of industrialisation in the Indian economy has its own special features, which are different from what is happening in most of the Western countries. In the first place, it has occurred much earlier in our history than it did in other countries and, secondly, its pace has not been as steady as in some other parts of Asia. Thirdly, while it was",270,195

In this paper, I will analyse the economic development of India from 1975-1985 and from the liberalization era of 1990s. The Indian economy is the seventh largest in the world in purchasing power parity terms. This paper presents the evolution and analysis of economic and population growth in India using data from Census of india, World Bank and National Sample Survey of Statistics. I have analysed the data on growth using Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the Granger Causality tests. For these tests, the variables selected as the dependent variable, namely the real GDP growth, are the most appropriate as they represent the performance of economy. India has made remarkable progress in economic, social and human development during this period. There has been a significant improvement in all indicators and it is expected that this trend will continue in future.

The textile industry is a very vast industry which covers a variety of sectors such as spinning, weaving, knitting, apparel, home textiles and many more. Textile industry plays an extremely significant role in the economic development of a country as it provides employment, revenue and economic growth. India is one of the world’s leading producers as well as exporters of natural and synthetic man-made fibers. The textile sector contributes 13% to India’ exports. It is the second largest employer in India after agriculture. In the last five year, India has shown a tremendous growth in its textile export which has gone from $ 12 billion in FY14 to 21 billion dollars in 2018.

The Indian economy in the 50 years (1950-99) after independence has shown a marked growth. The per capita income rose by 2.7% per annum. But, the employment growth rate has been very slow, especially in recent years. In 1998-89, there was a decline in growth of per capital income as the GDP growth slowed down to less than 4%. At the same time, growth in employment slowed considerably and the unemployment rate rose from 7.2% in 1983-84 to 11.5% by March,1999. This is despite the fact that the labour force participation rate increased from around 35% to more than half during this period. There are two important reasons for this slow growth and employment decline. First, during the second phase, a new set of problems arose. Second, in addition to these factors,",278,182

Abstract
This paper presents evidence on price adjustment in an open economy, using a vector error correction model of real output and prices for India. The results show that prices are not flexible in response to changes in relative prices but are flexible with respect to real variables. Price rigidities may explain the low responsiveness of the price levels to relative price changes. There is a negative long-term relationship between relative real wages and relative relative consumer prices. This suggests the existence of downward nominal rigidity. An explanation for this is provided on the basis of an investment function for real wage determination and the assumption that nominal wages are determined in terms of relative productivity.

Srivastava, S.; Srivas, T.K.
1991-01-31
The paper presents the results of a model, which describes the dynamics of national, regional and infrastructure production system. The model takes account of technological progress, population, and environmental degradation. These variables are related to the production functions, the demand for infrastructure and their prices. In a national system, it is assumed that a country is a homogeneous unit and the infrastructure supply is determined by the prices prevailing in the economy and technological change. A regional system takes into account the regional nature, i.e., the spatial nature of infrastructure requirements and its demand. It is shown theoretically, as well as empirically that the model is capable of capturing the dynamic interaction of factors affecting infrastructure demand and supply and hence provides a useful model for the analysis of long term infrastructure planning. Further, a simulation analysis is carried out to study the interaction between infrastructure, technological advance and population",280,194

This is about the history of political, economic, social, and cultural changes of India from the period of independence until recently. This is not about a history which is based on a linear development, rather a historical development which has changed in its structure, direction, or form of development.
It is important to distinguish between the'slow process of change' in the political and economic sphere, as well as in other spheres, such as the social sphere. In the case of economic development in particular, the development has not always been linear. Sometimes there have been periods of stagnation and periods with rapid growth. For example, from 1980 until 1990 the Indian economy grew at an average of 5.5 percent. The average annual growth rate in 2007/2008 was 8.2 percent.

The results indicate that macro-economic variables significantly affect stock markets in India. It is found that the macro variables, in general, positively affect the stock market. In the case of the Bombay stock exchange, GDI and NSS show significant negative relation with stock returns. GCI and GDF have significant positive relation, while the negative relationship for TBR is statistically insignificant.

I would like to talk about how India has grown since the 1980s, what has happened since, how the economy has progressed, the various issues that the Indian economy faces today, some of my views, my ideas for how things can be improved. The post is very short, it is meant to be an intro to a series of posts I will be publishing, to give an idea of what I am planning to do. Please do not judge me too much by this intro post and my other posts. They are meant as a start, I may be wrong, but I do believe that I should not be afraid of saying wrong things.

India' s development has not been a smooth or a straight process. In 1979, the government of Prime Minister Morarji Desai passed the Land Acquisition Act, which provided for a fair compensation to people who were dispossessed of their land. It was not until 1942 that the first Indian economist was appointed to serve in the Reserve Bank as a consulting economist. This is also a major factor in hindering the overall growth of Indian companies, as most of them are owned and run by families. A major economic issue that is affecting India today is their growing population. One is that it is a country of many ethnic groups each with their own language and culture. There have been many changes in India’s economy and social system since independence. Indian Culture is one",298,191

ABSTRACT:
Digitalization has been an integral part of our life and has brought about a change in our lifestyle as well as work pattern of the people.

With the advent of internet, digital media, social media and mobile communication, the world of marketing has seen a tremendous change and it is also a known truth that the digital world is the place where we are all connected. In the recent times, marketing world has moved on and there is a huge shift towards digitalization of everything including advertising, promotion and marketing.

Abstract
This paper is a critical reading of the 2003 Telugu political blockbuster, ‘Chandanaraju’, which is also known as “Shamiripura,” and the Telugu TV drama series (2009-14) - 'Chanda' and ""Chinna Chinna Kamaanukku"". The paper argues that, both the films and drama, though they have different narrative styles, they both share the same ideological project of building a nation, a state, and a people — a project that is built on the ideal of shared sovereignty and which also seeks to re-envision the past in a way that will benefit the future, or in other words, the nation as well as the state.

I will need to see your model. However, I would say that the data in the United States does not support Wagner’s Law. There are so many factors involved that would affect the wages.
- What type of work is the job in question. Is it a skilled position that requires education and training? If so, that might affect how much money you could expect to make as an individual. If you were to compare a high school graduate with the skills to a college graduate in an office job, then they would not make nearly the amount. Also, if the office worker had an MBA then that person would get paid more. A job that required a degree would be paid less. The same is true for jobs that are considered to have a very",306,187

Indian economy,push or pull? drivers of female labor force participation during india's economic boom,"push or pull? drivers of female labor force participation during india's economic boom
This paper investigates the relationship between the female wage premium and the level of economic development in India for the period 1979-97. We find a negative relationship for all but two of the four periods. The negative coefficient suggests that women are not pushed out of labor by rising wages or rising employment opportunities for men, nor are they pulled out by increased educational opportunities. Rather than being pushed into a job by economic growth, women appear to be pulled in because they have the opportunity to work. This is consistent with the view that economic expansion in the developing world provides the opportunities women want. ()

This paper investigates the relationship between financial development and its impact on the Indian economy during the post 1991 reforms period. The Indian financial market has evolved from the 1960s to today. Financial market liberalization in the form of foreign equity participation, and the creation of a secondary market through the introduction of trading system on exchanges have been a significant part of this process. A VAR model is estimated using monthly data for the period between 1980Q2 and 2007Q4. In addition, a VECM model with financial depth as proxy for financial intermediation has been used in order to assess the effects of financial deregulation on India's financial sector. Finally, the effect of de-regulation has also been assessed by the use of an ARMA model. These empirical studies provide evidence that financial markets in India can be characterized by a positive relationship with GDP growth during both the pre- and post-",317,187
Indian economy,economic inequalities and poverty in india: an interpretative overview,"economic inequalities and poverty in india: an interpretative overview of social stratification in India
The present study has tried to present an interpretation of the social and economic structure of India from the point of view of stratified societies. This attempt may, at best, constitute an introductory chapter of a much more ambitious research. The present interpretation is confined to the Indian case, which may be considered a typical case in its social, economic and institutional structure. It was a colonial society, with one group of colonisers - the Portuguese who arrived there first, followed by the Dutch and the English, who succeeded the former and finally by British -- with the later two sharing a common language (English) and religion. In this context we may try to interpret social structure through four broad parameters. These are population structure; stratifications of wealth and income; the role of institutions; and patterns of power and authority.

This paper examines the relationship between Digitization of trade and employment creation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the role of Digitisation of Trade and E-Commerce in creating employment in an economy. A time series econometric model is developed to test the hypothesis that digitisation and electronic commerce have a significant impact on employment. Results show that ecommerce has a positive impact upon employment and also it helps to create employment for rural and semi-urban areas. Digitized trade has also shown a direct relationship with employment; it has been seen that in India, trade digitised with China, has increased the employment rate in the economy, thereby reducing the unemployment rate and increasing the economic prosperity of the country.Keywords: digitized Trade, employment, e commerce, China.",329,191

Abstract
In this paper, based on a detailed analysis of the Indian employment data from 1983-94, we study the evolution of informal employment in India. We argue that the recent increase of non-agricultural informally employed population should not be seen as a sign of worsening economic performance, as some recent studies suggest. Rather it should be interpreted in a context in which informal sector is increasingly seen to be a source for positive growth effects through the creation of new job opportunities, and its positive impact on growth in terms of productivity, income and inequality reduction is growing. Our results show that, although informal labour share is increasing in Indian economy, the positive effects on economic development of this employment growth still prevail. In order to better understand the nature of positive employment effects of informa1 employment, in this work we also provide an analysis on the employment characteristics of formal and informal sectors in rural and",333,183

Introduction
The Indian economy is currently in a state of deep shock and
shivering following the 8 April shocker by the Indian stock
exchange and the rupee, with the latter falling by as much as
25% in the following weeks, before being capped by Reserve
Bank of India [RBI] intervention. This has led to the government
of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh'resign' and a series of
unprecedented measures being announced. The government has
also announced the setting up of a special high powered
committee headed by eminent economist C. Rangaraj to suggest
measures to boost growth and investment.
This note will attempt to analyse the reasons why Ind",341,182

In the current context of a global financial crisis and the consequent recession, many analysts feel that there is scope for the growth of sustainable services in the Indian economy. In view of this, the authors of these articles analyse the impact that growth in services has had on the economy and its sustainability, in a country like China, with its ‘new economic growth’ paradigm. The authors then examine how this growth pattern is applicable to the case of India. They analyse a number of indicators that measure the sustainability of growth. This paper is intended to contribute to our understanding of Indian sustainable economic and social development, which is the key goal of our economic development policy.",345,196

Indian economy,linkage between financial inclusion and economic growth: an empirical study of the emerging indian economy,"linkage between financial inclusion and economic growth: an empirical study of the emerging indian economy
The present paper examines the linkage between the financial access to rural poor and their economic development, through a micro-level analysis using the data from the household survey. The analysis of this paper is based on the assumption that the access of rural households to banking and microfinance institutions can improve the living conditions of poor households by providing them with financial services. In particular this study aims to identify the impact of micro financing on income generation and poverty reduction of households. For this purpose, a regression model for the poverty status of a household is estimated. A two-stage least squares estimation procedure is used to test the hypothesis. Empirical results reveal that access and use of financial service by poor farmers has positive and significant impact on their income and on household poverty. Further, the results indicate that for each 10 percentage point increase in the number of banks in a district / village, household per capita income increases by 0.03 – ",347,189

The Coronavirus Outbreak in India is having a major impact on Indian economy. This is the biggest economic slowdown the world has faced since the Great Depression of 1930s, when the global economy was in deep recession. The Indian government has taken several steps to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, including the suspension of visas, cancellation of flights, and lockdown in some parts of India.
Impact of Corona Virus on India’s economy:

About 40 Indian companies have grown to be the multibillion-dollar multilocation global corporations. They have also been the source of 60% of the exports in India. The Indian government has encouraged the growth of such companies and has created various incentives for them to expand their operations abroad. It is argued that these companies can provide the resources and capabilities to develop the domestic infrastructure, which will help to reduce the trade barriers and increase the country’s exports.
The Indian multinational companies in this book are analysed by looking at their performance in terms of growth, investment, employment and export performance. These companies are also evaluated against other multinational corporations operating in similar industries. This paper argues that Indian multinations have contributed positively to the Indian economy as a whole. However, it is also found that the benefits of these multinas are not spread evenly throughout the society. There is a need for the government to focus on improving the infrastructure",349,192

the economy is the engine of our society and it is in dire need of re-engineering. the first step of this reimagining must be in rethinking the nature of government’s role in the economy.
we need to move away from our current model of state intervention (which is often too interventionist) to a model that is more inclusive. this means more private participation in public sector projects, and greater autonomy and freedom of action for public-sector employees. it also means a greater emphasis on the private sector’ s participation. in fact, the government should be the driver of development. but this will also require a fundamental change in mindset. instead of viewing the state as a hindrance to economic growth, we need it to be a partner in economic development and prosperity. we must recognize that the role of the public in an economy should not be limited to providing social services. rather, it should include providing economic infrastructure for development, supporting innovation, encouraging private-public",350,199

The most recent major economic development is China’s rise as an economic power. It has become the world’ second largest economy, behind the United States, with its 2016 GDP totaling $11.2 trillion. China is now an important trade partner with the U.S., as well as a leading producer for many other countries. In 1980, China had been the 13th largest producer of goods, but that ranking fell to the fifth-largest in 2008. By 2050 it is expected to be the third largest. This rapid growth is due to China being able to manufacture goods much more cheaply than many developed nations, due in part to its lack of environmental regulations. Because of its cheap labor, many manufacturing jobs in the west have",351,193

About this paper
This paper examines the tradeoff b etween inflation rate and the rate of unemployment using monthly inflationary data from the period January 2000 to December 2010, for India. Using the Johansen cointegration test, the long-run relationship between the two variables was found to be statistically insignificant at 5 percent level of significance. In short- run, a positive and significant relationship was observed between both the variables, which implies that a trade-off does exist between these two macroeconomic variables in India during the post reform period.",355,187

This article explores the impact of capital inflow on the economic variables of a country by studying the capital flows and the macro economic parameters of an economy. The paper also tries to explore the determinants of these capital flow.
Capital flows are those which occur when one country borrows or invests its money in another country. Foreign capital investment in one's economy is called capital influx. If the economy of one particular country experiences capital outflow, it is said to be capital deflows. It means there is a capital movement of money from a high yielding economy to another economy with lower yielding potential. In other words, a flow of funds from one capital account to the other capital accounts. Capital inflations and outflows are the most important factor which affects a nation' s economic condition. These infl and def of foreign capital are influenced by many external factors, like interest rates, exchange rate, inflation rate etc. A change in these external economic variable may also",363,193

AbstractThis paper studies the link between the liberalisation of India's economy and stock prices by examining the returns to the acquirer and target in takeovers, using a unique sample of 1200 acquisitions over a twenty year period. We find that, in the short term, there is a negative association between liberalization of economic activity and acquirers' and targets' returns on the day of the takeover announcement. However, this negative relationship is not sustained over time. Our findings suggest that the initial negative impact of liberalizing reforms on acquire 2006-02.

This paper investigates the causal relationship between per capita energy use (PCEU) and GDP, with the objective of analyzing the impact of energy on GDP growth. The study is motivated by the fact that India has the highest growth of per-capita energy consumtion, and is among the fastest growing economies with a per capital energy usage that was 0.2 percent of global energy demand in 2011. A long-run relationship is estimated with co-integration technique. An error correction model - ECM is then employed to estimate short-term dynamics of the two variables, which also confirms a long –run causal link between the variables.

This dissertation examines the problem that American Indian reservations experience, the collective nature of the challenge, and the role of American government institutions to address this challenge. American Indians experience a lower level of living than the non-Indian population. The reasons for this lower standard of life are not simple and can be attributed to a combination of factors such as low human capital, a lack of access to land and credit, limited economic diversification, as well as the legacy of Indian policy and culture. This work uses the theory of public choice to develop a model that explains how American reservations can experience low standard living and why this is the current situation.

It examines how exports have contributed to growth at the macro level. This paper analyses the contribution of manufacturing and service sectors in export led growth.

The services sector, which is the backbone of the country, is growing at a pace of about 7% in terms of GDP.
It’s a good thing that services are on such a roll, but what about the other sectors?In fact, they are still struggling to recover from the financial crash.This means that they will be unable to grow as quickly as the manufacturing and construction sectors.As such, the growth in services will likely slow down, leading to a slump in the economy, especially as demand for labour is falling.However, despite all this, it is still possible for these sectors to expand in a sustainable way, provided that the government can provide the right environment and incentives.For one thing, there is a huge demand in India for skilled, educated and trained labour, and this is reflected in its labour-force participation rate, one of India’S highest.In 2015-",374,185

Abstract:
This paper assesses the impact of the economic liberalization and structural adjustments programmes in India, with special reference to agriculture. It is argued that in spite of many setbacks, there has been significant progress. The reforms, although incomplete, have been a success in terms of increasing output and employment. A major constraint to the success of economic reform, however, has not been lack of progress, but rather the political resistance of those who benefit from the current system of patronage. This resistance is now weakening, which is a positive sign for future growth and development prospects in the country.

Defining the difference between the current accounts and the balance of payments is the first step in understanding the connection between them. The current balance refers to the sum of the transactions that occur in a particular period of time, whereas an accounts balance is a summary of all transactions of a country during a specific time period. When there is more money leaving a nation than coming in, that is called a current deficits. It occurs when there are more imports than exports. A current surplus, on the contrary, refers that exports of any good are greater in amount than the imports of that good. Current surfeit is when the country imports less than it exports and there exists a positive balance. These differences in the accounts lead to differences between countries in international trade. Countries that have large current balances or deficits have to spend more in order to",405,189

AbstractWe use cointegration approach, using data for 12 Indian regions from 1980-2010 to analyse the relationship among the variables. We find that energy and economic development has significant effect on the level of environmental pollution, while growth has insignificant effect. Energy consumption also has a negative effect and a long run relationship on environment degradation. It is further observed that per capita energy use has an important impact on energy related pollution and environment. A reduction in energy per person leads to an increased environment related problem. This suggests that it is possible to reduce environmental impact by improving energy efficiency in order to achieve sustainable growth.

In a recent study, it was reported that the foreign exchange reserves of India have risen to a whopping 3 billion U.S. Dollars, the highest in more than a year.

Abstract
In the past decade, India’s computer industry has experienced an explosive growth as a result of globalization. This has brought with it an influx of foreign direct investment. The industry is also growing as it becomes increasingly self-sufficient in the development of its own software products, and as more and more software companies set up operations in India. However, the Indian computer services industry still faces a number of challenges, including a lack of a formal education system and skilled labour, which is a critical issue that has led to the industry’ s inability to reach its full potential.
There is an emerging need to look at the political-economy of this industry and its impact on the society as well as on other industries. In a developing economy, such as India, where the economy and society are intertwined with each other, there is little point in looking at only one aspect of it, as the",425,181

We analyze the link between employment and skills in India. We use data from 2004-05, 2011-12 Input-Output tables for India and 1987-88, and a detailed survey on skills, to estimate employment-skill link. The estimated link is consistent across skill levels and regions, with the exception of the lowest (least skilled) level. In terms of sectoral employment, we find that employment in the manufacturing sector is more skill sensitive than employment across other sectors. Further, the estimated employment–skill link suggests that skills are less important in manufacturing than in other services. Our results also indicate an increase in job opportunities in services, but these do not compensate for employment loss in.",430,192

The Return of The Colonial In Indian Economic History: The Last Phase Of Colonialism In India,1949-97 by S.P Singh
In this book S Singh provides the first full length study of economic aspects of Indian decolonization. He examines the role of foreign capital and trade in India's last years of independence and assesses the impact of decolonialization on the Indian economy. The author concludes that, despite the many problems and difficulties, the economy had shown a high rate of growth in real terms from 1950 to the beginning of 1960s, with the rate falling off after that in order to reach a level close to 3% in 1993.

Indian economy,positive and negative impact of gst on indian economy,"positive and negative impact of gst on indian economy
GST is not a perfect tax but is an improvement and it should not be discarded so easily. GST is a tax on goods and services. A negative tax is the opposite to an income tax, where the government collects less revenue by allowing for deductions and exemptions. However, in 1972, the then PM of India, Mrs Indira Gandhi introduced a uniform national tax that brought together the state taxes into one national levy. The GST will also ensure the tax collection is uniform across all States and that the same rate is applied to each commodity. It will be the world’s largest tax reform since World War 2. [6] As a matter of fact, GST can be called as an indirect tax since no physical goods are being taxed, unlike in GST. As per the new structure, a 28 percent GST would be levied on services such as telecom, banking and insurance, while the 18 percent tax would remain on the sale of goods.",433,196

Indian economy,shortage of skilled workers: a paradox of the indian economy,"shortage of skilled workers: a paradox of the indian economy
Shortage Of Skilled Workers
It is said that India has got a ‘skills paradox’. India’s economy depends very much of a highly skilled workforce but at the same time has a shortage of highly educated and skilled manpower. According to the latest report released by ManpowerGroup, India needs nearly 10 million skilled people. However, the government is unable to meet the demands of this skilled labour market. In fact, according to another report, nearly one million new jobs are to be created by 2022. This is a great challenge before the Indian government because there is no way to overcome this gap. So, we can say that in India, there exists a skills paradox.
Reasons Behind the Shortage
The first reason why India lacks a skilled work force is that the country’ education system does not produce enough skilled and educated labour. Secondly, Indian economy is not able to",435,182

The tertiary industry sector has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years. It has been the principal factor in making the Indian economy, a ‘manufacturing based’ one. As per the latest estimates of Central Statistical Office, 55.8% of the gross domestic product [GDP] and the employment in the economy is accounted for by this sector. The sector is also the biggest consumer of energy in India; it accounts for 45% – 49% share of total energy consumption. Thus, the sector occupies a significant place in our economy.
Tertiary industry is that part of manufacturing sector which has an important role in creating and expanding the manufacturing base of an economy and has a strong multiplier effect. Tertiary sector includes services like transport, storage, hotels and restaurants, communication, entertainment, education, health care, and finance. Together, these services have the potential to generate a large number of employment opportunities which can play a vital",436,200

This research project aims at investigating the linkage between financial inclusion in India and the growth rate of the Indian economy for the period 1995-16. Using a cointegrated VAR model, results from this study indicate that financial deepening in the economy has a significant positive impact on real GDP, which has improved over time.
The results also indicate the existence of a long term relationship between real financial depth and real output in both the short term and long run. Further results indicate financial development to have had a positive effect in reducing the volatility of Indian output and to a small extent in curbing the variability of inflation. Financial depth has also had some influence in increasing the rate at which the real per capita income increased.

The small industries are those in which capital investment is not very high and the output of the industry is sold in the domestic or local market. The MSME sector is one of our largest employment generators and has been growing at a much faster pace than the overall manufacturing and service sector. “In 1983, the micro and small sector constituted 98.9 percent of total number of manufacturing industries, 93.7 percent in 2014-15.

The main purpose of the present research is to examine the nature, structure, and performance of India’s economy. In the context of a growth model that is well established at the theoretical level in the economics literature, we examine empirically the extent of unemployment generated by sustained economic growth and whether the growth process is capable of creating sufficient employment or not. This is done using the Okun’a law which is a measure of employment elasticity of growth. The paper is organized in five sections. Section one introduces the basic concepts of national income accounting. It describes the major sectors of Indian economy, the methods of estimating national product and the national accounts.
In section two, a theoretical analysis of Okuns’ law is presented. We discuss the various interpretations of this law and its relevance to the study of economic development and policy. A brief history of development of macro-economic analysis is provided in section 3, where we trace the origin of Ke",446,190

The global competition in FDI has been intense in recent times. It is also possible that the FPI limit for some companies could be raised from the existing 24% to a higher level, if the company has to raise capital for R&D, manufacturing of high-tech products, or other such purposes.

This paper provides an empirical assessment of the growth-promoting effects of government expenditures and policies in India for the period 1971 to 2002 (part I of an ongoing study). The authors find that the effects are highly concentrated: while there exist several policies which have had a positive effect on growth during the past three decades, others have clearly worked in the opposite direction. A large number of policies have been tried and discarded. The main policy conclusions are that, although the government's fiscal deficit did play an important role in promoting economic activity, its impact was limited. On the other hand, a well-targeted, pro-poor expenditure program can have a very significant impact, particularly when it complements private capital flows. This finding is especially important, since there is currently a tendency in many developing countries, especially in South Asia, to advocate a ""privatization"" of social and economic policy, as a means of",448,190

The history and economy of this region can be traced back to the period of pre-colonial India and the early period.
However, in recent years, with rapid developments and increasing globalization, this trade has also become more complicated.

In this paper we examine if the changes in stock index have an impact on real GDP (GDP growth). The study uses quarterly data over the period 1994-99 for 12 countries. The result is that there is a negative relationship, meaning that an increase in the stock price increases the real gross domestic product. There are two possible interpretations of these results. One is the fact that stock prices have a leading role in real economic activity. Second, there might be a lag in economic activities.
