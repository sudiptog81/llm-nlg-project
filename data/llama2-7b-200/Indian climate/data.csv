Monsoons are a blessing to the farmers. They give them a chance to grow cropland. But, monstrous rains also cause floods and landslides. These rainstorms also make the roads slippery.

The 2014 IPCC report on climate impacts on India
Climate change is the change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time. In other words, climate is a state of the atmosphere, defined by patterns of temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and other meteorological variables in a given region. Climate can be considered as the average weather, or more rigorously, as an average condition over a 30-year period.

The country is also the third-biggest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, behind China and the United States. It is the fourth-highest emitter of carbon dioxide, the main green-house-gas pollutant. India’s emiss-ions are expected to rise by 60 percent by the year 1990.

This means that India will need to be prepared for these changes, both in terms of infrastructure and in the way that its people live and work.
The report also highlights the need for India to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, as these are a major contributor to climate Change. India is already taking steps to do this, but more needs to Be done if the report’smission is to succeed.

Indian climate,"Indian climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction: the role of community-based adaptation
In this study, the authors explore the extent to which community based adaptation (CBA) can be used to enhance disadvantaged communities’ resilience to climate variability and climate related disruptions. They examine the experience of a community in Tamil Nadu, India, that has been implementing a CBA project since 2009. The study shows that CBAs are useful in enhancing community resiliency to disruptive climate events. However, CBBs need to be supported by the government and other development partners, and need a long-term perspective to achieve their objectives.
