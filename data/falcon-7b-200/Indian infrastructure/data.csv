Indian infrastructure,"Indian infrastructure companies have been on a high on the stock exchanges. The reason for this was that the central government had announced plans to invest Rs50 lakh crore in various infrastructure projects. As a result, there was a huge demand seen for the stocks of the sector.
However, the recent announcement by the government to raise the minimum investment in the infrastructure sector, by a large margin, has come as a dampener for some. It has been learnt that a decision to this effect was taken in a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In all, it was decided to bring up the investment cap from the existing Rs15 crore to Rs1,000 crore. However, this is only applicable to the road and rail sectors. This move was also made in order to make sure that more private players come into the fray. At present, only the public sector undertakings (PSUs)",482,180

Indian infrastructure,"Indian infrastructure has been at the forefront of the country's growth over the last few years. As the nation looks to expand its economic reach, it is imperative that the infrastructure in India is developed at scale.
The government is working towards making India a USD5 billion infrastructure investment market by 2019. The country is currently USD300 billion in infrastructure deficit. In order to bridge this gap, the government has announced a series of initiatives which will provide significant impetus to infrastructure development in the coming years
Key infrastructure projects
Infrastructure projects are a critical driver of growth and are at an inflection point in their growth. India' s infrastructure sector has grown at a CAGR of 5.2% over FY11-16 and is expected to reach USD1.6 trillion by FY18.

Infrastructure, as an industry, has seen a 25 per cent growth over a year, and 40-60 per cemt jump in margins.
“It’ll take another 5-6 years for infrastructure to reach 20 per-cent of India’a GDP, from its current 13 per. cent,” Mr. Bihani added.

The NIP will act as a catalyst in driving investment from private, local and global sources, both public and private sector and help to create a robust and sustainable pipeline of investment projects.
India is already in a race for infrastructure with China having invested more than USD1 trillion over the past decade, and the Government of India is now making a strong push towards the same. In the last 3-4 years India has witnessed a surge in investment interest as well as projects in all the key infrastructure sectors.",488,185

Indian infrastructure,"Indian infrastructure is in a bad shape. Roads and bridges are crumbling. Power and water shortages have become the rule. Air quality has become a cause for concern for public health. The list goes on and on. So what is the government doing about it? Well, not much it would seem. This year's budget is a good example.
There're a couple of announcements worth cheering. First, the 7th Pay Commission is getting a substantial increase in its budget. (The 6th pay panel recommended a whopping 100 per cent hike to the pay of civil servants – including bureaucrats, police and defense forces -- but the Modi government only partially accepted it). Second, there is an increase of 10 per in rural employment schemes. Third, a new scheme for skill development will be launched.

A bill has already been approved by the Lok Sabha and needs only the nod of the Rajya Sabhya to become a law.

It’s not a new idea. In 2016, the Narendra Modi government approved the use of foreign currency debt instruments for the construction and operation of roads, and the finance ministry is also considering the possibility of allowing the Indian Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) to invest overseas. India will also be joining the ranks of other countries like the UK, China and Japan, whose sovereign bond markets are among the world’ most liquid.

Indian infrastructure,"Indian infrastructure is facing an unprecedented pressure in meeting the increasing energy requirements to drive the growth engine and improve the quality of living of citizens.
The power sector in India is undergoing significant changes, including the introduction of competition, liberalisation of tariffs and a large number of power plants in the pipeline. India's power infrastructure, therefore, requires an overhaul and modernisation to meet the growing power demands. It is estimated that India requires $2.5 trillion by 2030 to achieve its electricity access targets. The Government of India has taken various steps to address the challenges, the main ones being increasing generation capacity, improving energy transmission and distribution, and developing renewable resources. While the Government is taking various measures to improve its generation capacities, transmission infrastructure has been the Achilles heel of energy security in a number in countries.

The most significant drop in competitiveness index (-8 points) was in the infrastructure pillar.”
The infrastructure deficit in India is huge, with the Asian Development Bank saying that the shortfall of US$1.4 trillion will require an average annual investment of almost US $200 billion over the next 15 years to make up for the gap.
