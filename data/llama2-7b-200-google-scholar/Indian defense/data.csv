India and Russia have been partners in defence for more than five decades now. However, the relationship has not always been smooth. The recent announcement of the joint production of BrahMos cruise missiles in India is a welcome development. This will not only improve the capability of both countries but also provide an opportunity to India to improve its technology and manufacturing capabilities.
The relationship between India and the Soviet Union began in 1947, when the Indian government signed a trade agreement with the USSR. In 2008, India became the world's largest arms importer, spending $4.1 billion on defence equipment. India'

Bhattacharya, Somdutta
This paper examines the relationship between defence expenditure and growth for India. It does so by applying the methodology of the ‘new’ defence economics, which is based on the premise that defence is a cost rather than a benefit to the economy. The paper estimates the defence multiplier for a panel of 25 Indian states for the period 1990-2011. We find that the impact of defence on growth is positive, but that it is statistically insignificant. However, the estimated defence effect is sensitive to both the specification of our model and the choice of states. This suggests that there is scope for further research on defence and its impact on economic development in India, using a broader range of models and data.

The role and importance of the armed forces is not limited to the military domain, but also extends to areas such as disability rehabilitation, relief and rescue, medical aid, and civil-military cooperation. This is due to their unique skill sets, infrastructure, equipment, manpower, logistics, training, experience, discipline, morale, leadership, esprit de corps, etc. The armed services have been a part of India’s disastrous response for decades.

India's Defence Industry
The Indian defence market is expected to be worth $100 billion in the next decade, with an annual growth rate of 7-8 per cent.
In the past, the defence sector was considered a ""closed shop"", with the government controlling all aspects of it. However, in recent years, there has been a gradual opening up of the sector, and it is now possible for private companies to enter the market. This has led to a number of new players entering the field, including some of India' s largest companies. In addition, foreign companies are also increasingly active in India, particularly in areas such as aviation and shipbuilding. As a result, India is becoming an increasing important player in global defence markets.",14,187

In his blog, the writer argues that the Indian defence establishment has been systematically underfunded for years. He also arguably suggests that a part of the budget should be used to create a ‘peace dividend’.
The Indian military has always been under-resourced and undervalued. It is not just the army, but also the navy and the air force. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has not been able to replace its ageing fleet of MiG 21s and Mirages, while the Navy has had to operate with an age-old fleet, which includes 1960s vintage destroyers and frigates. And the Army, well, it is a story of its own. So, there is an urgent need to increase the defence expenditure. However, this does not mean that we should increase it blind",17,200

In the late 1870s, the British government began to question the value of its control over the North-West Frontier of India. The region was remote, and its inhabitants, many of them, at least, hostile to British rule. It was difficult to defend, because of both the terrain and because the local tribesmen were able to move quickly and with great mobility. In addition, it was also a place where the costs of maintaining an army were high, while the benefits were uncertain. And, finally, its strategic importance was limited.
Nevertheless, for more than a century the Frontiers had been the responsibility of Britain. They had to be defended, or so it seemed. There were two reasons for this. First, British India was the 'jewel in the crown' of a",28,190

Instead, it is being disbanded and replaced by a new army that will be made up of volunteers. This new force will have no military experience and will not be able to fight against Pakistan.",32,190

However, the US has been unable to overcome the ‘hangover’ of the Cold War, and its strategic vision for the region remains wedded to the notion of containing China.
The US is also concerned about India’S growing defence ties with Russia, which has emerged as a key partner for New Delhi.

The 2015 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Yearbook states that India’S defence spending of USD 55.2 billion is the fourth largest in the world, and that it is likely to increase to US$ 65 billion by 1922. India is also likely
to be the second largest importer of major weapons by the year 912, with an import of 8.5 per cent of global imports. The Stockholm Yearbooks have been issued annually since 31. It is a compilation of information about the military expenses and imports of weapons of countries around the globe.

The Defence Ministry has also decided to introduce a new category of capital acquisitions, “Buy (Indian-IDDM)”. This will allow the procurement of defence equipment from the private sector. It is expected that this will provide an impetus to the ‘Make in India’ initiative and help in boosting the economy. However, this is not the first time that such a category has come into existence.

In the last 10 years, India has made a remarkable transition from a net importer to a major exporter of defence equipment. This has been achieved by the indigenisation of many products, including radars, airborne warning and control systems, missiles, artillery guns, armoured vehicles, naval ships and submarines. It is also the only country in the world to have built a fully indigeneous aircraft carrier. The government has now set a target of 60 per cent indigeous content in all defence acquisitions by 2025. With a large number of projects in various stages of execution, this target appears achievable. In the process, the country has also emerged as a hub for the global aerospace and defence industry.

The Envisionment of A Nation is an attempt to explain why this is so. What is it about the concept of India that has led to its rejection by so many people? The book takes a long historical perspective to answer this question, and traces the origins of this idea to the eighteenth century. The author argues that the Indian idea has been a source of inspiration for many thinkers, including the founding fathers of modern India, who drew on the ideas of Enlightenment philosophers like Montesquieu and Rousseau to construct a new nation.

Criminal law is an integral part of our legal system. It is the most important area of law, because it is concerned with the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are guaranteed by the Constitution of India. The criminal code is a body of rules and regulations that set out the guidelines for the conduct of the criminal process. These rules are meant to ensure that the accused person is treated fairly and that justice is done. However, the rules of evidence and procedure are often complex and difficult to understand, and it can be difficult for an accused to defend himself against the charges brought against him. This is where the role of a criminal lawyer comes in. A criminal attorney is someone who is trained in law to represent people accused of crimes. They are responsible for preparing the case and presenting it in court. In this article, we will discuss the various aspects",50,195

The defence industry has undergone significant changes in the recent past. The defence budget of the country has increased significantly and there is a significant thrust on indigenisation. There is also a strong emphasis on innovation and R&D. This has resulted in a new set of challenges for the defence services and defence industries. In order to meet these challengers, there needs to be a change in how innovations are created and implemented.
Innovation is the process of creating new ideas, products, or services that are better than what already exists. It is important for businesses to constantly innovate in order for them to stay competitive in today’s market. However, innovating can be difficult for many business owners because they don’t have the time or resources to do it. That’ why it’ important to hire an innovative consultant who can help you come up with new and creative ideas that will help your",82,196

A recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has said that India’­s military spending is expected to increase by 6.8% in 2018, making it the world’’ s sixth largest spender.
The report has been released a day after India and the United States signed a major defence pact to deepen military cooperation between the two countries. India is set to sign the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) with the U.S. during the annual bilateral dialogue. This paves the way for the Indian military to use U.S. bases and ports for supplies, repairs and maintenance, and allows the American military access to Indian bases.

The Indian defence industry has been undergoing a transformation. In recent years, the Indian government has taken various steps to enhance the capabilities of domestic defence manufacturers. One of these initiatives is the “Make-in-Indian” (MII) programme, which aims to promote the development of a robust domestic industry capable of meeting the country’s defence requirements.
In this context, it is important to examine the role of India-Kenya defence relations in the context of MII.

The joint forces of India are evolving in a way that it is becoming more and more difficult to distinguish between the three services. The jointmanship is being practiced at the operational level, and in the training and education of the officers. It is not that the joint training has been done away with.
Jointmanships are not only being done at operative level but also at strategic level. This has given birth to the concept of ‘jointness’. ‘JOINTNESS’ is a concept that has emerged in recent years in Indian defence. Jointness has come to be accepted as a basic requirement for any modern military. As joint operations have become an integral part of modern warfare, the need for joint services has also increased. There is no doubt that joint operation is more efficient and effective than separate operations. But there is also a need to develop",87,200

The Indian Ocean is a unique marine environment, with its rich biodiversity and the importance of its ecosystems for the well-being of the region’s populations. Its coasts, including those of Western Indian countries, are threatened by climate change and sea level rise. In order to protect these vulnerable areas, a new project has been launched to explore the potential of green infrastructure to reduce flooding and coastline erosion.

The Frontier Tribal Areas (FTA) of British India are not well known to historians. This is not surprising, since the FTA was a borderland, a front line of defence, and a military zone. The FTAs were a buffer zone between the British Raj and the Muslim Sultanates in Afghanistan and Central Asia. In the late nineteenth century, the region was threatened by the rise of the Russian Empire and by annexationist tendencies of local rulers. To defend the border, it was decided to create a special administrative zone with a unique system of government. As a result, there were two parallel administrations, one British and one tribally, that co-existed for decades. A peculiarity of this zone was the presence of a large number of military canton",90,192

The US is the largest exporter of defence equipment to India, accounting for more than half of all defence imports in 2006-07. In the wake of the recent scandal involving counter-feits in spare parts for the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, the US Department of Defence has tightened the procurement rules. These changes have implied that the Defense Security Service (DSS) will have to be involved in all purchasers of US defence articles and services.

In this article, we will analyse the provisions of the Bill and argue that the Indian government has failed to protect the privacies of its citizens. The Bill is likely to be passed in its current form, and the government is unlikely to make any significant changes to the proposed legislation.

Coastal Erosion is one of the most important environmental problems faced by India. This is due to the high population density, industrialization and urbanization along the coast. The Southwest Coast of India is most vulnerable to eroding. A detailed study has been made on the eroded coasts in Southwestern India, which includes the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Coastal defence structures are being constructed to protect the shoreline from erodible forces. In this study, the effectiveness of these structures has also been studied.

India is also concerned about the quality of Russian weapons and the lack of transparency in the procurement process. In addition, India has been looking to diversify its defence suppliers and has signed contracts with other countries, including the United States. Russia is the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for more than 70% of the country’s defence budget. However, the recent developments have put the future of this relationship in doubt.

South Asia is a region of high strategic importance to the United States, and the security of this region is of great concern to both the US and Indian governments. The development of India’s missiles, including its nuclear-capable ballistic missilities, has implicated the nuclear strategies of both India and Pakistan. This paper examines the evolution of Indian missilery and its implication for the strategists in both countries. It argues that the development and deployment of the Prithvi and Agni missils have made India a nuclear power and a de facto nuclear weapons state. These missels have also made the Indian nuclear strategy more robust, thereby reducing the probability of a crisis or conflict.

India’s move to divest its stake in state-run defence companies may give a boost to the country’ s defence industry, but it will take time for the benefits to show.
“There is a need to develop the defence industrial base in the private sector. It will be a long-term process,” said Ajai Shukla, a defence analyst. “It is not going to be easy.”
The government on Wednesday approved a plan to reduce its holding in Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) to 26% from 64.63%. It also approved the sale of its 51% stakes in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd and BEL. The move is part of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’ government’ effort to boost the economy by selling stokes in public sector companies. BHARAT ELECTRICALS

S. N. Vohra
Defence is one of the most important functions of government. The defence of a country is a very serious and responsible task. It is the first responsibility of any government to protect its people from any external aggression. Defence of our country has been the primary responsibility and function of armed forces for centuries.
The security of India has always been of paramount importance to its political leadership. In the last few decades, the security environment in our region has undergone significant changes. India is surrounded by hostile neighbours and a host of non-state actors. China and Pakistan are the two main adversaries of Indian security. Both these countries are engaged in an arms race to enhance their military capabilities. Pakistan has made significant progress in developing nuclear weapons. This has resulted in a strategic imbalance in the region. There is also a growing threat from non state actors like Al-Qaeda, Taliban and other terror",123,200

The Indian defence sector is growing at a steady pace, and it is one of the most important sectors in the country. The defence budget of India is around 2.5 lakh crore rupees, which is about 1.7% of its GDP. This is a significant increase from the previous year’s budget, when it was around Rs 3 lacs.
In order to promote the growth of this sector, the government has introduced several regulations. These regulate the manufacturing and export of defence equipment, as well as the use of technology and research. In addition, there are several reforms in place that are aimed at making the sector more efficient and effective. Here are some of these reactions and their impact on the industry:

The British Empire in the twentieth century is often seen as a series of setbacks, retreats and humiliations. This book argues that the British were in fact able to hold on to their empire by exploiting the very weaknesses that were attributed to them by their critics. It examines the case of the Transcaspian frontier in Central Asia, where the collapse of Russian authority in 2015 created a power vacuum.
This book examined the response of Britain and India to the Russian collapse and arguing that Britain was able in effect to re-establish a frontiers in a part of Central Asian that had been out of its control for nearly a century.

India's defence requirements are growing and the need for a strong defence industrial base is becoming increasingly imperative. In this context, the Defense Production Act 1980 and its subsequent amendments have been in force for several years. The policy has remained unchanged over the years and has not kept pace with the rapidly changing global scenario. Therefore, a review of this policy is overdue. As a first step, it is necessary to define the scope of policy and clearly identify the objectives. Defining the policy scope and objecting the objective is the first and most important step in the process of making policy. However, this is not a static process.",149,188

To achieve these missons, India has an array of ballistics missles, including short-range, medium-ranged, intermediate- and intercontinental- range ballastic missle systems.
However, while India’ s ballistc missels have been deployed, they are not fully operational. For example, its Prithvi-II (P-2) short range surface-to-surface misslie (SRBM), which has been in service since 1995, is yet to be fully integrated into the Indian military.

The state defense order in 2102 was fulfilled in full, the volume of which amounted to 1300 billion rubles, and the share of import-substituting products in it was 60%. The share was increased by 4% compared to last year. Import-replacing products were delivered to the troops and forces of 36 regions of Russian Federation. In 70% of cases, such products are delivered on time. This is a good indicator. It is also worth noting that the state defence order for the first time was implemented in compliance with the plan.

Pakistan has never been a friend of India, and it is not likely to become one.
Their foreign policy has always been based on the assumption that India will be their enemy. The two countries have been at war with each other three times in the past, so it's not surprising that they still view each another with suspicion. This is especially true of Pakistan, which has a long history of supporting terrorism against India. In recent years, however, Pakistan has begun to moderate its stance towards India and is now more open to cooperation. But it remains to be seen whether this change will last or whether Pakistan will revert to its old ways. Only time will tell.",163,199

From the French Revolution to the Napoleonic Wars, and from the Congress of Vienna to Trafalgar, the Middle Eastern territories were the theatre for a series of conflicts which determined Britain’s place in world politics. This book describes the development of British interests in Syria, Egypt, Persia, Arabia and Turkey, as well as the early stages of the East India Company’ and the British Navy’’ s involvement in these regions.

The Partitions of India and Pakistan are among the most traumatic events in the subcontinent’ s history. They were the result of the British Government’’ decision to grant independence to India on 15th August 47. The decision was taken after a series of events that began with the arrival of Lord Mountbatten in India in March 2046. These events, which were to change the destiny of millions of people, were neither inevitable nor unavoidable. On the contrary, they were a result, among other things, of a flawed British policy of ‘’divide and rule’. This policy had been followed for more than a century and had led to a situation where the Muslims were alienated and marginalized in a predominantly Hindu India.

Defence analysts in India and abroad are united in their assessment that India’s defence expenditure is inadequate to meet its security requirements. The reasons for this include the fact that defence spending has been declining as a proportion of the GDP, the inability of successive governments to build a consensus on the nature of India's security challenges, and the failure to make defence procurement more efficient. This talk will examine these issues, arguing that the current problems are rooted in the country' s past.

India's defence education system has been in a state of flux since independence. In the first years after independence, the Indian military was not adequately staffed, and the British officers who had been trained at Sandhurst and at the Royal Military College in India were needed to fill the ranks of the army. But by the 1960s, India was producing more than enough officers to staff its armed forces, yet the system of education that produced them was inefficient, ineffective, unimaginative, lacking in innovation, unable to attract the best and brightest, out of touch with the needs of a modern military, unaware of developments in military education around the world,...

Economic growth is a key factor for achieving sustainable development. In the last decade, the Indian economy has grown at a rate of 6.7 per cent per annum, which is the highest growth rate in the world.

The British reorganised their Higher Defence Organisation (HDO) in 2004. In 1998, the HDO was made up of the Ministry of Defense (MoD), the Joint Staff Committee (JSC) and the Chiefs of Staff (COS). The JSC was the most important of these three, as it was responsible for the strategic direction of defense. The COS were responsible to the MoD for operational matters.
In 30 years, there had been a significant change in the global strategies of defence. This led to a shift in priorities for HQ MoS, and in particular, to their role as the center for strategizing. It was decided that the C-in-Cs, who were the only representatives of all three services, should be the chiefs and not the staff. They should have the responsibility for strategy",205,191

The Indian government is the largest employer in India and employs around 30 million people. The Indian Armed Forces is one of the biggest employers in Indian defence sector. According to a report by the World Bank, India has one the lowest military expenditures in Asia. This is because the government has been unable to meet its budgetary requirements and has had to rely on foreign loans to fund its military. As a result, Indian military has become dependent on the US and other countries for its weapons and equipment. In 2105, China was the second largest exporter",210,190

In order to promote the growth of MSMS in the defence sector, the government has taken several initiatives, such as the ""Make in India"" campaign, which aims to encourage foreign companies to manufacture their products in Indian MSSEs.

This book examines the role of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in the civil–mil­it­ary relationship in India. The author argues that the MoD is a weak min­istry and that its role in civil­milita­ry relations is not well defined. This has led to a lack of accountability and control over the defence forces, which have been allowed to become autonomous and powerful.
The author traces the development of civil military relations over a period of 60 years, beginning with the first defence secretary, Lt Gen P. C. Lal, in 1954, and concluding with a brief discussion of current issues. He describes how the structure of Mo­D has remained unchanged since 2001 and how it has failed to meet the needs of a modern defence minis­try. There is no clar",219,191

The results revealed that the three land races showed high tolerances to both drought and salinity stress. However, the tolerant land race showed higher antiprotease activity and lower prooxydative activity than the sensitive land race. Moreover, tolerants showed significantly higher chlorophyll content, higher photosystem II activity, lower non-structural carbohydrate and starch content and higher leaf water potential than sensitive. These results suggest that tolerable land raced showed better leaf functioning in photosythetic and stress-",220,183

The political dynamics of India' s Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) programme have been subjected to intense speculation and debate in the past few years. The programme, which has been in existence since the early 1980s, was officially announced in January 2003. Since then, there has emerged a plethora of reports in both the Indian and international media on the programme. There are also a number of studies and articles on BMD published in academic journals. Most of these studies are either purely technical in nature or focus on one aspect of the BDM programme without providing a comprehensive picture of its political and strategic implication. This study, therefore, attempts to fill this gap in knowledge by examining the political factors that have influenced the development of BM D in India.

Amidst the political furore over the Indian government’ s decision to withdraw the country’’ status as the world’ second largest arms importer, New Delhi has quietly launched its new ‘’Nuclear Doctrine’. The new doctrine has also been accompanied by a new set of nuclear delivery vehicles, including a nuclear submarine and a long-range nuclear missle. It is being argued that the new policy is a major departure from India’ previous nuclear policy, where the focus was on a minimum deterrent.

The Indian defence industry is a dynamic and rapidly growing sector that is playing an increasingly important role in the country’s economy and national security. The industry has been growing at a steady pace over the past few years, and is expected to continue to do so in future.
One of the key drivers of growth in this sector is the increasing demand for defence equipment from the Indian Armed Forces. With India’ s growing population and increasing security concerns, the need for modern and sophisticated defence systems has become a priority for the government. This has led to an increase in investment in research and development, as well as in procurement of defence goods and services. According to the Ministry of Defense, India spent over $55 billion on defence in 2019, which is more than double what it spent in just 10 years.

The Indian armed forces are undergoing a major transformation. India’a defence expenditure has increased significantly in recent years. The country’ s defence budget has doubled over the past five years and is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace.
This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including India s increasingly assertive foreign policy, the country s growing economic power, and the growing threat from Pakistan and China. These factors are putting a strain on the Indian military, which is struggling to keep up with the demands of the government and its allies.

The First World War, and the subsequent interwar years, were a period of intense debate over the future of the British Empire. In the years following the end of hostilities, the colonial governments of India and Australia began to agitate for greater autonomy and self-government. This book analyses the strategic and political implications of these debates for the defence of Britain and India. The book examines the political and strategical thinking of key figures in the post-war period, such as the Secretary of State for India, Sir Edwin Montagu, Lord Chelmsford, General Sir William Mitchell, Winston Churchill and Lord Halifax. It shows how the imperial debate had a profound impact on the formulation of British defence policy, particularly in relation to the Indian Army.

Defence research and development (R&D) should be given priority.
Increase the share of indigenous content in defence equipment to 60 per cent. Currently, it is 40-45 per. cent

Offsets are a mechanism to ensure that the benefits of defence acquisition are shared with the host country. In the Indian context, the Defense Offsets Policy was announced in 2005 and is aimed at achieving a fair and balanced distribution of the economic benefits derived from defence procurements.
The Definitive Approach
As per the policy, foreign vendors are required to invest a certain percentage of their total contract value in India, in projects that are related to the defence sector. The investments are to be made within a defined period of time, which varies from contract to contract. These projects are known as ‘offsets’.

This paper examines the implication of BMD for the strategical stability of South Asia. It is argued that BDM has the potential to destabilize the nuclear deterrence of Pakistan, and to lead to a nuclear arms race in South Asian region. The paper also suggests that the BMG will not be able to dampen the Pakistani nuclear capability. However, it will strengthen India's conventional military capabilites.

Japan’s BMD system is intended to protect against a limited ballistically missle attack from North Korea, but it is also likely to be seen as a threat by China, with whom Japan has a territorial dispute in the East China Sea. India is a close ally of Japan and has also been considering BDM. However, India’ s BM D programme is primarily designed to provide a shield against Pakistan, and China is not seen to pose a serious threat.

India has always been reluctant to do so, and for good reason. The CTBT is a flawed treat. It does not provide for the verification of nuclear tests. This means that India would be able to conduct nuclear weapons tests without any international oversight. Additionally, it does nothing to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Indian Defence Expenditures in Global Perspective
In the last two decades, India’s defence budget has grown at a rate of 10 percent per annum. This is a remarkable achievement in a country where defence spending is perceived as a drain on the economy. India is the world’ s fourth largest military spender, with a defence outlay of US$ 55.6 billion in 2018-19. The country’S defence allocation is expected to grow to USD 62.5 billion by 3032-33, and US $ 80 billion to 700 by the year 02524.

The new century is already upon us and India is poised to take its rightful place in it. The country is on the threshold of a new era of economic development, and a major transformation in its defence and security postures is inevitable.
India has been a free and independent nation for more than 50 years. In this time, it has developed a formidable defence capability. This has enabled the country to play an active role in international affairs, including peacekeeping and disaster relief operations. India has also been an important partner in global economic growth. But the rapid changes in technology, the globalisation of the economy and the emergence of new security threats have created new challenges for India. These challengers will require a more proactive approach to defence, both at home and abroad. To meet these challenged, India will need to develop a defence strategy that is both forward-looking and",327,198

The Defense Ministry of India has been trying to push through a series of major arms purchases from foreign suppliers in recent months, but the effort may be slowed by the need to meet a set of complex rules and regulations.
In June, India’s Defenses Minister Manohar Parrikar said that the country would spend $100 billion over the next decade on arms imports. India is looking to purchase fighter jets, submarines, and helicopters. The country is also looking for a new attack submarine and a second aircraft carrier. But the Defensives Ministry may have trouble getting the approvals needed to make the purchasing decisions. A senior official in the Ministry said, “I think it is a bit of an exaggeration.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between defence expenditure and real GDP growth in Pakistan and India, using the co-integration and error correction methods. The study has found that defence budget has a negative effect on real growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in both countries. For Pakistan, the defence-Gross National Products (GNP) ratio is 2.5 percent while for India it is less than 1 percent. However, in the short run, defence has no significant effect in India but it has significant negative impact in case of Pakistan.

India is the most important U.S. partner in Asia. The two countries have a long history of cooperation, and their relationship has been strengthened by the UPA government’s reform agenda. In 1998, India conducted its first nuclear test, which led to a UNSC resolution condemning the test and calling on India to suspend all nuclear tests. India, however, refused to do so. Instead, it conducted another series of tests in 90s, after which it became a de facto nuclear weapons state. This led the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on New Delhi.

1. Introduction The defence industry is a key sector for the economic growth of any country. In the context of India, the country’s defence industrial base has been characterised by a combination of imports and indigenous production. While the former has ensured the availability of a wide range of defence equipment to the Armed Forces, it has also led to a high dependence on imports. Moreover, a large part of these imports are from a limited number of countries, which in turn has resulted in a vulnerable supply chain.
The defence policy of 2013 has, therefore, sought to promote indigeneous design, development and manufacturing of equipment by the private sector. The policy also encourages foreign collaboration and technology transfers for defence production, subject to certain conditions. This has led the Government to consider relaxing the existing FDI policy in defence. Recent policy announcements have, however, been met with criticism from",346,194

Politicians are good at a lot of things, but they are definitely not good leaders in battle. It is a well known fact that a good leader in war is someone who can be decisive and make the right decision in a split second. The problem is, the politicans don't have this ability. So, they make decisions based on what they think will get them votes. This is not a recipe for success in military matters. We need to elect people who have military experience.

Simon’ s policy had three main aspects: first, it was a policy of support for Russia; second, a commitment to France; and third, an attempt to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Simon believed that the first two of these aspects were necessary for Britain to be able to defend its interests, but the third was necessary to ensure that Europe was not dominated by a single power. He argued that if Britain did not support Russia, France would be forced to take on Germany alone.

A.K. Dwivedi, A. K. Singh, R.C. Srivastava, and S.S. Sharma
The cost of research, development and production of any defence system is a function of its complexity, technical and schedule risks. It is essential to have a cost estimate of the project at the beginning of development to be able to assess the cost and time overruns and to take corrective measures. In this paper, a method for the estimation and analysis of cost risk is presented. The method is based on the concept of probability of occurrence of risk and probability distribution of costs. A model is developed for estimation the probability distributions of project cost, schedule and technical risk.
Key words: Cost estimation, defence, research & development, risk, probability, Monte Carlo simulation
An improved approach to the evaluation of multi-criteria decision making problems

Greening Indian Defence Forces: A Conceptual Framework Towards Accelerating Carbon Neutrality In India -
The concept of green defence was first introduced in the 1980s. The term was defined as the military’s responsibility to protect the environment and to reduce its own environmental impact. Since then, the concept has evolved to include a wide range of activities, including energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction, and pollution prevention.
In recent years, there has been growing interest in green defense among military leaders and policymakers. This is due, in part, to the increasing awareness of the importance of environmental sustainability and the need to address climate change. Green defense is also seen as a way to enhance military readiness and resilience by reducing the risks posed by climate-related disasters",409,181

The deal is worth $2 billion. This is a big deal for Turkey as it will be its biggest ever export of military hardware. It will also be a major boost for Armenian' military, which is under-equipped.

The Indian defence budget has been in a state of flux since the mid-1990s. The Indian armed forces have been underfunded for decades, but the situation became more critical during the 15-year tenure of former Prime Minister Vajpayee.
Vajapayee’s tenures (10 years in power) saw defence spending rise from 2.7% of GDP to 3.2% in 5 years. However, this was not enough to meet the demands of a growing military and a large number of ageing equipment. Since 9/11, the Indian military has had to deal with an increased threat from Pakistan and China, which has resulted in increased expenditure on the military.

India is a country with a large population, a strong economy, and a growing defence sector. In recent years, India has been increasingly looking to export its defence products and services. This is due to a number of factors, including the increasing demand for defence equipment from countries around the world, as well as the growing need for India to generate revenue from its exports.
There are a few things that the defence manufacturers in India can do in order to make their products more export-friendly. Firstly, they should focus on developing products that are tailored to the needs of the export market. Secondly

As it becomes increasingly important for India to maintain its security and stability, it is essential that it has a strong military-industrial complex. This complex will provide the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the military, as well as the economy.
The economic imperative for developing a robust military is clear: a well-equipped military can help ensure that India remains secure in the face of threats from both within and outside its borders. The defence industry in India is currently worth about $25 billion, and is expected to grow to $50 billion by 2022.

In the post-1231 war years, India was more focused on the political and economic fronts and defence was relegated to the back burner.

The defence under Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code is available only to the accused persons who are suffering from a mental disease. The defence is not available to a person who has a defect of reason, but is capable of knowing what he is doing.
Insanity is a state of mind where the person is unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts. In other words, the law does not recognize a man’s right to kill another person because he happens to be insane. It is the duty of a court to protect society from such persons. Hence, insa nity as a defence has been rejected by the courts. However, in the case of R. v. Dudley and Stephens (1883) 11 QBD 273, it was held that if a defendant is suffering form a severe mental disorder, he may be acquitted. This decision was",449,192
Indian defense,private defence under indian criminal law,"private defence under indian criminal law

This article discusses the issue of private self-defence under Indian criminal laws.
Private self defence is a complete defence to a criminal charge if it is proved that the accused has acted in self defense. It is not necessary that there should be a reasonable apprehension of danger to the life or physical safety of the person. Even if the appellant had not reason to believe that his life was in danger, he can still claim private defense if he had acted to protect his property. The right of self protection is inherent in the right to life. In the absence of any statutory provision, the common law position is that a person can use force to defend himself and his family, his body and property from assault, and to prevent crime. 
The right is limited by the principle that it must be used in proportion to, or not exceeding, that which is necessary to repel the assault. This is known as the ""proport",450,197

India is a country that has long been associated with the pursuit of knowledge and learning. From the days of the ancient Vedic civilization to the modern era, India has been home to some of history’s most important thinkers and philosophers.
Today, however, the country is facing a crisis of ideas. In recent years, there has emerged a growing sense of intolerance and authoritarianism, as well as a climate of fear and repression. This has had a profound effect on the intellectual life of India, with many of its brightest minds leaving the county in search of more tolerant and open societies. As a result, it is more important than ever that we defend the spirit of free thought and critical inquiry in India. The following essay collection, The Idea of New India: Essays In Defence",452,180

The study finds that India is the largest recipient of military equipment from the United States. India receives 40 per cent of all military sales from America. Pakistan is ranked second with 14 per cents of total military imports from USA. On the other hand, India’s military expenditure is 3.6 percents higher than that of Pakistan.

India is a major military power, with the world' s second largest armed forces. It has a wide range of capabilities, including nuclear weapons. Its defence budget is the third largest in the World. However, the defence spending is only about 2.2% of GDP, which is less than the 3% minimum that is recommended by the UN.
The defence budgets of other countries are much higher. For example, China'S defence outlay is about $ 110 billion, or 4.6%of GNP. This is more than double the Indian figure. The United States, on the other hand, spends about six times more on defence, about eight percent of its Gross National Product (GNP).

It is true that there are some differences. The western perspective is based on the assumption that the individual is the unit of analysis and not the society. It is also based upon the idea that all cultures are equal and that they are in competition with each other. Therefore, it assumes that multicultural societies are inherently unstable. This is a very misleading assumption. In fact, multcultral societes are not inherantly unstabe. They are only unstabale if they have a weak political system. If the political systems are strong, then multculural socities can be stable. India is an example of a multulcual society that is stable despite having a large number of different cultrues.

India is at the forefront of cyberspace development, but its cybertroopers are not fully prepared to meet the challenges of the new era of war.
By R. Sridhar
The Indian Army has been working on its network-enabled warfighting concept for some time. But the concept of network centricity and the associated need for cyberexpertise has not been fully assimilated by the force. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has done better. It is already a networked force and is looking to further enhance its capabilities. In contrast, the Indian Navy is still struggling to integrate its networks. However, it has started to address the cybernetworking aspect of its war-facing capabilities and has begun to recruit cybettroops.

The Indian Army is the world’s second largest standing army, with over 1.2 million active personnel. It is also the second most expensive standing military, after the US. India’ defence budget is over $40 billion a year, and is growing at a rate of 8-9 per cent annually. This is in sharp contrast to the declining defence budgets of the West. In the last decade, India has increased its defence expenditure by more than 300 per
cent, while the USA and UK have cut their defence spending by over a third.

India has a reputation for being an arms importer, and is often criticised for its lack of a long-term defence industrial policy. This book examines the reasons for the apparent lackadaisical approach to defence procurement and provides a detailed analysis of the various arms imports over the past two decades. It looks at the procured equipment, the defence and strategic environment in which it was acquired, its role in the development of Indian defence industries, India' s defence doctrine and the country'S political and economic situation. The book also analyses the implications of India becoming a nuclear weapon state and its potential impact on defence acquisitions.",496,190

In the context of the Indian scenario, the project is aimed at identifying the role of phytophysiological parameters in the induction of antimicrobial defence system in crop plants and their role in controlling the spread of diseases. The role and effect of various phythophylogical parameters on the expression of defence genes in plants will be studied.
The project will also focus on studying the effect and role phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications on defence proteins in relation to the development of disease resistance. Various phosphonates will act as a potential source of plant growth promoting compounds and will aid in improving the nutrient uptake in crops. Hence, these compound will help in increasing the yield of cropping systems.",497,184

India has a lot to be proud of. It is one of the world' s largest democracies, with a population of over a billion people.
It is also one the fastest growing economies in the developing world. In the past decade, India'
s GDP has grown at an average rate of 7 per cent, making it one
of the top five fast growing countries in Asia. India has the fourth largest army in
the world, and is the third largest arms importer. This is a remarkable achievement for a country that was once one-third of its current size. However, despite these achievements, the country still faces a number of challenges. One of these is its defence. The country has been spending more on defence than any other country in South Asia, but it is still struggling to defend itself. There are a few reasons for this.
