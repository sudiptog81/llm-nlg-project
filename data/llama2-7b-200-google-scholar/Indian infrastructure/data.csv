India is set to be the fastest growing major economy in the world in 2018. The government’s policy initiatives to improve infrastructure, increase ease of doing business and focus on manufacturing, coupled with the continued economic growth, will drive the need for more efficient, cost effective and reliable infrastructural development.
The country’ s infrastruc-ture sector is expected to receive a boost from the government, which has announced a slew of initi-atives in its Union Budget 17-108, including a national highway development fund, a highway asset recycling fund and a rural roads development agency. It has also set aside Rs. 4.97 lakh crore for the railways, R3.28 lacr for roads and highways and R69,0",0,182

Infrastructure is one of the most important sectors of an economy. It is an important factor in the growth of any economy and has a significant impact on the lives of people. Infrastructures are the basic facilities that are required to sustain the economy of a country and they play a crucial role in improving the quality of life.
The infrastructural facilities of India are one-of-a-kind and have been developed over the years. India is a developing country that has been able to develop its infrastruc­ture over time. The infrastru­cture of Ind­ia is divided into three categories: physical, social, and economic infrastr­ucture. Physical infrastruture is the physical infrastrut­ure that is needed for the development of industries and the provision of services. Social infrastrur­e is required for social welfare and health care. Economic infrastrure",3,188

Subjects: Waste management
Abstract: 'Waste' is a key term in the literature on globalisation and development. It is often used to describe the 'wasteful' production of the global North, and the inefficiency of its recycling. In contrast, the waste of global South is seen as a valuable resource. This article argues that these opposing views of 'global waste' are both wrong. Rather than being a problem to be solved, waste is central to the functioning of contemporary capitalism. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Delhi, it shows that waste management is not just a technical problem of recycle, reuse or dispose, but a political one of how wastefulness is defined. The article highlights how 'infrastructure' (defined here as the political, legal",8,191

The Indian economy has been growing at a rate of 7.5% per annum for the past decade. This growth has led to a significant increase in infrastructural development in the country, with the government allocating 6% of the GDP to infrastruc-tural expenditure in 2011-12. The Indian government has recently announced a National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) of Rs. 102 lakh crores. While the overall NIP is a welcome initiative, there is little information on the sector-wise allocation of funds.

Infrastructural development is a key element of economic growth. The government has a major role in infrastructure development and its commercialisation. However, the government's role is not only in the creation of infrastructual facilities but also in their commercialization. This is where the role of the private sector comes in.
The private participation in public infrastrucutre projects (PPPs) is increasing in India. In 1995, PPPs accounted for only 4% of total infrastrcture investments. By 9th Plan (10th Five Year Plan), the share of PPPS in total investment in infastructure was 8%. In the 6th and 7th plan, it was only about 3%.

India’s infrastructural growth has been constrained by lack of access to capital, particularly for infrastruc-ture projects that are large in scale and have long gestation periods. The Indian Government has initiated a number of measures to encourage private sector participation in the infrastru-cture sector. Among these, the most significant has probably been the introduction of the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme. Under this scheme, VGFCs are formed with the purpose of providing the ‘gap’ funding for a project. VCFs, which are typically private equity funds, are given the mandate to invest in projects identified by the VFCSs. This paper examines the impact of syndicated VGC investment on the project performance.

Smarts roads are a new concept in road design that will have a significant impact on the way we travel and the world around us.
Smart roads can be divided into two categories: those that use technology and those without. The first category includes smart parking, smart traffic signals, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and intelligently connected vehicles (ICVs). The second category does not use any technology, but rather relies on human drivers to make decisions about their travel. This second type of smarts road can include things like traffic lights, speed limits, stop signs, etc. In this article we will discuss the benefits of using smart technology in roads",22,191

The sector is characterized by a large number of projects with a high degree of complexity. These projects are often complex because they involve multiple stakeholders and involve a number
of different technologies. This complexity makes it difficult for the government to manage the projects and ensure that they are completed on time and within budget. As a result, there is a need for better governances in infrastrucutre projects. Governance refers to the way in which a government or an organization is organized and managed.

The 'development plan—town planning scheme' mechanism is used by the Egyptian government to acquire land for urban development in Cairos suburban areas. The mechanism was introduced in 2002 as a means to provide an alternative to the traditional land acquisition mechanism of the state. It is based on a system of land rights and land valuation that allows the government and the private sector to obtain land at market price. This mechanism has been criticised for its lack of transparency and its failure to protect the interests of poorer landowners. In this paper, the author examines the effectiveness of this mechanism in terms of its impact on the land market, its effect on urban land use, and whether it is a viable alternative for land development.

Investments in infrastructural development, especially in roads, railways, ports, airports and power sector, are essential for a country to achieve higher economic development. The infrastruture sector is also one of the major drivers of global economic activity.
In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in analysing the infrastrucuture development of China. China’s economy has grown rapidly in recent years and it is now the second largest economy in terms of GDP. However, China is still a developing country and its infrastrucre development is lagging behind that of India. This paper compares the level of infrastrure development between China and India, and identifies the factors that have contributed to the differeneces in their infrastrutre development over time.",41,182
Indian infrastructure,Issues in promoting rural infrastructure in India,"Issues in promoting rural infrastructure in India
The Indian economy is in a state of transformation. In the last few years, the country has been able to reduce poverty and increase its growth rate. The country is also making a significant contribution to global economic growth. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure that the benefits of economic development are shared by all.
One of the major challenging areas in rural India is the lack of adequate infrastructural facilities. Rural areas are often deprived of basic amenities like roads, electricity, and water supply. This results in poor living conditions and hinders economic activity. Therefore, it is essential to invest in infrastruture in these areas to improve living standards and promote economic activities. There are various initiatives that are being taken by the government to promote rural development. These include the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Y",42,182

This paper analyses the impact of infrastructure and information and communication technologies (ICT) on the productivity performance (PP) of Indian firments. The study uses the annual data for the period 1998-2007 for 3224 firmen from the manufacture sector. We find that the infrastructural quality of firment's location and ICT investment have a significant and positive impact on their PP. Our results also indicate that ITC investments have been more effective than infrastruture investmrnts in improving the PPP of manufacturers.

This paper examines the impact of state-level infrastructural development on the productivity of Indian manufacturers. The analysis is based on a dataset of 1,291 manufacture units in 23 Indian States for the period 31 March 03 to 5 April 97. We use a two-stage least squares estimator to estimate the parameters of a stochastic frontier production function, which is assumed to be a Cobb-Douglas function of capital, labour and a set of inputs which include infrastruc-ture. Our results indicate that the level of productive efficiency is higher in the states which have developed their infrastru-cture better than the others.

Innovation in infrastructural development is a key challenge for India. The country is the world’s fastest growing major economy, but the infrastruc­ture is not keeping pace with the needs of the growing population.
The automotive industry is well positioned to be a catalyst for infrastru­ctural innovation. It can do so by developing new mobility solutions that reduce the need for automobiles and by providing innovative solutions to address the existing infrastrutural challenges. This paper presents a set of case studies that highlight how the automo­bile industry has responded innovatively to infrastruture challeng­es in the past. These case study examples can serve as a starting point for further research on innovating in in­frastructure.",45,200

The idea of ‘alternatives’ to the ailing neoliberal order has gained currency in recent years. It is being used to describe a variety of approaches to economic development, from state-led industrialization to community-based production. The idea that there are ‘good’ alternatives to neo-liberlism is premised on the notion that the latter is a system of economic governance that is fundamentally flawed. This is because it is based on a set of ideas and policies that are inimical to human welfare. These ideas include a focus on profit maximization and efficiency, the belief that markets are self-regulating, and the idea (which is",62,189

Jennifer Deger
This paper traces the infrastructural speculation on India's railroads between 28 August 80, when the first railway line in India opened between Bori Bunder and Thane, and 30 September 44, the day the British government nationalised the country' s rail system. The paper argues that the history of infrastruc- tural investment in colonial India can be seen as a series of speculative bubbles, each of which was followed by a crisis of investor confidence, which in turn led to the creation of new forms of government-led infrastru- cture. These bubble-and-crisis cycles were repeated on an increasingly global scale between the 60s and the present day.

However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure that infrastructural development is sustainable and benefits everyone. These challengers include:
The lack of coordination between different levels of government when it comes to infrastricture planning and development. This can lead to duplication of effort and resources, as well as delays in projects being completed. Additionally, a lack coordiantion can result in inefficient use of resources and poor quality infrastruture. Finally, if there is a mismatch between the needs of the region and the infrastrcture that is being built, this can have a negative impact on economic growth and job creation",69,196

China and india have experienced rapid economic growth over the past few decades. However, water resources have not kept pace with this growth, and water supply and sanitation (WSS) services have been a major challenge for both countries. China’s water sector has been dominated by the state and investment in infrastructures has largely been financed through state funding. In India, the central government has played a more limited role in water and WSS, with most of the investments being made by state governments and the private sector. The financially constrained nature of state-owned enterprises in India has led to inefficient WS services.

In this paper we use a panel dataset of Indian states for the period 1993-2005 to examine the linkage between infrastructural development and economic performance in rural India. We find that a one standard deviation increase in the road density index is associated with an increase of about 7.5 per cent in agriculture output. This positive association is found to be more pronounced in states with a higher share of agriculturally dominant districts. Further, we find a positive link between the electricity density and the agricultura l output in India, which is more prominent in those states where the share in electric power intensive sectors is higher.

Indian infrastructure,Financing infrastructure,"Financing infrastructure in the digital age
Economic development is dependent on the availability of infrastructures, such as transportation, energy, water, telecommunications and sanitation. Infrastructure investments are critical to a country’s economic growth. However, many developing countries are unable to meet the increasing demand for infrastrucutre due to their limited financial resources. The lack of financing is one of the biggest obstacles to infrastruture development.
In the past, infrastruucture financies were mostly provided by the government. But with the rise of private sector participation, the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) has become more important. PPPs allow the private sectors to finance and operate infrastrcutures in exchange for a share of revenues. This is a win-win situation for both the public and private partners. Private sector financess can provide much-ne",84,185

Jayant M. Patil, R. Mishra
Municipal waste water is a major source of pollution in urban areas. It contains various pollutants such as nutrients, organic matter, heavy metals, suspended solids, pathogens, and microorganisms. In India, the municipal waste-water treatment plants are designed to treat only domestic waste. The treatment of municipal wastes is an important issue in developing countries. This paper describes the characteristics and treatment technologies of the wastewaters from the domestic and industrial sources in Indian cities.

The Government of India (GoI) has identified the need to improve the financing of public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructural projects. This is because the PFIs (public financial institutions) are not able to finance such projects on their own, and the government's own resources are limited. The government has been trying to overcome this problem by encouraging PPPS (project preparation support), and by setting up a PPI (Project Preparation Institute).

India’s infrastructure deficit has been a major constraint on its economic growth. The country’ s economic performance has improved in the past few years, but infrastructural bottlenecks have been slowing down the growth momentum. A lack of investment in infrastruc- ture has resulted in delays in completion of projects, and the consequent dela- yed completion has led to an increase in project costs.
The infrastru-cture sector in 2013 accounted for 37.6% of the total capital expenditure (capex) of Central and State governments.

India’s urban infrastructure is in dire need of an overhaul. The country’ s cities are in a state of disrepair and are struggling to keep up with rising urbanisation. This is leading to a slowdown in economic growth and the creation of a vicious cycle of poverty and poor quality of life.
Infrastructural deficiencies are also impacting the competitive advantage of Indian cities, with some of them falling behind in the global race to attract foreign investment. Investment in infrastructures is essential to improve the quality and availability of services, and to enable cities to meet the needs of their growing populations.

Estimates of the equitable cost to society of capital investments in regulation-constrained infrastructures have been used by governments to inform the design of infrastruture policies and regulations. We estimate the pre-tax cost-of-equity (COE) for investment in the electricity and natural gas securities markets in emerging economies. In addition to traditional determinants of COE, we include the impact of investor perceptions of market risk and government policy risk. Using the implied volatility of stock returns and a model of government risk, our estimates of pretax COEs are 15.7% for electric utilities and 9.5% to 8.8% (depending on the level of risk) in natural-gas distribution companies.

The paper investigates the performance and valuation of 15 infrastruc-tural firings during the period 2006 to 30 June 6, 013. Using the panel methodology, we find that VICA affects the overall performance, profitabil-ity and market valuations of these firgs. We find a positive effect of VAC on profit-ability, with the most significant effect in 410. However, the effect on market value is negative.

Public expenditures on infrastructure in India have increased significantly in recent years, as have the efforts to improve their efficiency and accountability. However, these efforts have not been accompanied by an increase in the public expenses on these projects, and the gap between public and private investments remains wide.
Infrastructural development is a key to India's economic growth and social development. The Indian economy has grown at an average rate of 7.2 percent in 1991-21, but the country has not yet been able to achieve the target of providing basic infrastructures to all its citizens. In 50 years since independence, India has spent about US$ 40 billion on public infrastruc- ture. This is about 0.7 percent of GDP in a year, compared to 3.5 percent for China. About 95 per cent of this expendi-",129,191

The Indian infrastructural sector has been growing at a rapid pace, driven by the country’s economic growth. Infrastructure is the backbone of any economy and it is critical for the growth of the economy. It is also the source of employment and income generation for a large number of people. The infrastruc-ture sector contributes significantly to the GDP and the employ-ment generation in the sector is higher than the average for other sectors.
There is a need to focus on the development of infrastru-cture as it will help in improving the quality of life of citizens and will also help to improve the economic conditions of a country. However, there are certain challenges that need be addressed in order to achieve this goal. One of these challeng-es is that the funding for infrastruce development is not sufficient and this is leading to a lack of investment in this sector.

Indian manufacturers are facing a severe crisis of competitiveness. The industry has not been able to maintain its growth momentum, which has been stagnant for the last four years. In this context, the role of state infrastructural development in improving the performance of the manufacture sector is important. This paper examines the impact of infrastruc-tural services on the productivity of Indian industrial units. It also estimates the returns to scale and the level of capital intensity of manufactu-ring units in India. We find that the infrastructoral services have a positive and significant impact on productiv-ity, while the capital intensities are high.

In India, the private sector plays an important role in the provision of primary education. However, there is a lack of research on the relative performance of private and government schools. This paper assesses the performance and costs of government and private schools, and compares the physical conditions of these schools with those of the public schools of similar economic status. The analysis is based on a sample of 2,217 schools from the 64th round of India's National Sample Survey. We find that private-sector schools are generally better equipped than government-run schools and are more likely to be located in urban areas. On average, government primary school teachers are less educated than their private counterparts. Private schools also tend to have higher teacher-student ratios, which may be explained by the fact that government school students are not required to pay fees",148,188

The results show that the program had a significant impact in reducing income and asset inequality, but the effect was not permanent. Income and wealth inequality increased again after the end of program.

Using a panel of 29 states in the country, the study finds that public infrastructural invest- ment and its components have a positive impact on GDP growth. However, private invest­ ment in infrastruc- ture has a negative impact. This may be due to the fact that private sector investors are more interested in profits rather than social benefits.

Infrastructural development has been a key priority for the government of India. The government has undertaken a number of initiatives to improve the infrastructure in the country.
The government’s focus has primarily been on improving the roads and highways infrastructures. In addition, the railway network has also been improved. However, there are still some areas where the improvement in infrastrruction has not been adequate. This paper presents an inter-State comparison of infrastrucutre and human development indicators in order to assess the performance of different States in this regard. It is found that there is a significant variation in these indicatots across States. Some States have performed better than others in terms of improing infrastruture and other States are lagging behind.",165,186

The Chinese government is increasingly involved in financing infrastructural development in Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries. This paper analyses the scope and impact of the Chinese approach to infrastruture finanace in SSA. It finds that Chinese involvement in infrastrucuture finance has been modest. However, the potential for Chinese finanacing is significant, as is the impact on the development of SSAs. The paper argues that China is playing an increasing role in bridging the gap in the finanacring of infrastrcture in Africa.

A new report by the OECD examines the role of public finance in urban development and infrastructures in five emerging countries: Brazil; China; India; Poland; and, SouthAfrica.
The report finds that the fiscus is a key factor in determining the quality of urban life and the competitiveness of cities. However, public spending on infrastruture in cities has not kept pace with the rapid urbanisation of recent decades. This has resulted in the deterioration of basic urban services, and in infrastrutures that are often inadequate and unreliable. Public speding on urban transport is particularly low. In 2012, the average share of total public expenditure on transport in large cities was 4.7% in China and 1.5%in India. By contrast, it was around 5.9% and around13% respectively in O",168,195

The infrastructural needs of developing countries are enormous. The private sector is an important source of finances for infrastruture, but it has been reluctant to invest in projects with high risks and low returns. This paper examines the possibility of using public private partnership (PPP) to attract private financse. It reviews the literature on PPPs and concludes that they can be an effective way of financing infrastrucutre projects in developing countrie. PPPS can help reduce the risky of investment in infrastrcture, and they may also help to reduce transaction costs. However, PPCs are not without their problems. They can lead to corruption and can also be expensive.

N2 - This paper investigates the underpriced issue of initial public offerings (IPOs) of Indian infrastructural companies during 2006-2102. We find that the IPO underperformance of the infrastrural firms is not explained by the conventional factors such as under-pricings, underwritings and over-allotments. However, we find the performance of these firmes to be related to the extent of foreign participation in the issue. This finding is consistent with the theory of agency cost. Further, the findings are robust to different specifications of sample and control variables. Thus, our study suggests that foreign investors may be more concerned about the governance structure of firme and hence, they are likely to avoid investing in firmed with poor governanace.

India has a long history of using canals for irigation. In fact, the first canal system was built in 2600 BCE. The first irriga­tion canal in the modern sense was the Ghaggar-Hakra canal, built by the Mughals in Punjab in about 1545. It was a 65 km-long canal. Most of these can­als were built to provide irri­gation for the cultivation of rice. They were, therefore, called ‘rice cana­ls’. Some of them were also used for navigation. During the British period, some of those can-als became important links in a network of canalisations that were to form the basis of modern canal sys­",183,191

Infrastructure projects have been the most important area of public-private partnership (P3) in the last decade. The main objective of this study is to explore the determinant of the profitability of PPP projects in India. For this purpose, the authors use a sample of 100 P3 projects and apply the stochastic frontier model (SFM) to assess the efficiency of these projects. In addition, they use the Tobit model to identify the factors that explain the variations in profit margins. According to the results, PPPS have a significant positive effect on efficiency. They also find that the project size, project type and the state in which the PPS is located are the main factors affecting the performance of a PSP.

Bicycles are a popular mode of transportation in many developing countries, but their use is often limited due to the lack of safe and convenient infrastructures. The present study is an attempt to quantify the effect of provision of infrastruture on the biking behavior. A case study of 1200 bikes and 40,025 biker days was conducted in the city of Bangalore, India. Bikers were interviewed on their baking habits and the availability of the infrastrcuture was measured on a scale of one to five. It was found that the number of days biciked increased by 70% when infrastrcture rating increased from 3 to 5. In addition, bikiing habbit was also found to be positively correlated with age, income, and education level.

It draws on interviews with local residents and officials to explore how the communities understand and respond to these projects. In particular, the paper looks at the political and economic benefits of the projects, as well as the social and environmental costs. I find that the residents are concerned about the economic and social impact of these large-scale projects and have begun to question the benefits that have been promised by the government.

The case studies in this report are based on research in two countries, India, and South Korea, which have very different approaches to infrastructural management. This report explores how these two approaches have influenced the motivation of staff.
The report finds that staff motivations are complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors. These include organisational culture, management style, financial incentives, the work environment, personal relationships, career development opportunities and work-life balance. It is important to recognise that different staff will be motivating by different factors, so it is essential to understand the range and complexity of motivators. In addition, different motivational approaches may be effective for different tasks or roles.

Transport infrastructural investment plays a significant role in economic development. This paper revisits the empirics of the growth-transport infrastruc-ture relationship in the context of India. Using the time series data for 1980–2010, the study finds that the transportation infrastru-cture investments have a positive and significant effect on economic activity. The study also finds the existence of an inverted-U shaped relationship. In addition, there is evidence of a non-linear relationship, which indicates that a higher level of transport invest-ment does not always result in higher economic output.

This paper examines the causal relationship between urbanisation and transportation infrastructures in India. Using a state level panel dataset of 29 states for the period 1890–1792, we have used a two-stage least squares (2SLS) method to examine the effect of transport on urban growth. The results suggest that transport is an important factor in promoting urban development. In the first stage, the results show that the road density has a positive impact on the urban population growth, while the rail density and the density of the waterway",206,186
Indian infrastructure,The role of data in aligning the'unique identity'infrastructure in India,"The role of data in aligning the'unique identity'infrastructure in India
The role and impact of digital identity systems in developing countries are under intense scrutiny. The Indian government has been working on a national digital identification system (Aadhaar) since 2009. This has led to a wide range of questions about the nature of the Aadhar system and the way in which it has impacted the lives of Indians.
This paper examines the role that data has played in the creation of AADHAR, the unique identity infrastructure of India. It also explores the ways in how the system has affected the daily lives and livelihoods of people in different parts of society. We find that Aadiha's role as a tool for social inclusion is significant, but that there are also many challenges associated with its implementation.",207,192

The paper presents a synthesized indicator to delineate regional differences in the process of railway development in India. It aims to understand the regional variation in railway connectivity in northeast states of India, which is a new emerging region in terms of development. The paper uses data from 2001 to 1991 and applies a two-step synthesis technique to create a composite index. Results show that the states are heterogeneous in their developmental trajectories. Meghalaya and Tripura are lagging behind in infrastructural development and are less connected to the national railway network. In contrast, Assams' railway system is well-connected and has the most efficient railway services in comparison with other states.

These settlement are located in areas with poor access to basic services, such as water and sanitation. In India, 70% of the urban population lives in slum settlement, and these areas are home to more than 35% the country's population. The government has committed to providing all slume dwellers with basic water services by 2030. However, the challenge is not only to provide water to slumes, but to do so in a way that does not disrupt the lives of people living there. This is where pop-ups can help.

Cold chain is the most important link in the food supply chain. It is a system of temperature-controlled storage and transportation of food from the time of production to the point of consumption. In India, cold chain infrastructure is still in its infancy. This paper aims to study the cold storage infrastructural development in India and the challenges faced by the industry. The data for the study has been collected from secondary sources.
The paper finds that the development of cold stores in rural areas is very low, which is not conducive to increasing the market share of frozen food in retail. As a result, there is an urgent need to increase the number of refrigerated warehouses in order to meet the increasing demand for froze foods. Furthermore, the paper concludes that inadequate cold store infrastruc- ture is one of the major challengers to growth of retails sector in",240,193

In India, elective violence is not only a criminal activity but a legitimate political tool. It is a means of winning elections, and the state and political parties often benefit from it. The article compares electorally motivated violence with electively motivate violence.
Based on fieldwork in West Bengal and Odisha, the article demonstrates that electorial violence has a structural basis. Patrons and their followers use violence to win elections. They also use it to mobilize their voters and to intimidate opponents. Vi",244,183

In the last few weeks, the coronavirus has spread to more than 70 countries. India has already reported 40 cases, including three deaths. The coronovirus epicenter is in China. But the virus has now spread in several countries, and the World Health Organization has declared it a global health emergency.
The virus can spread through human contact, or by touching objects and surfaces contaminated with the infectious virus. While the symptoms are similar to the common cold or flu, they are more severe in some cases. In the worst cases they can lead to death. To prevent the spread of the disease, WHO has recommended that people wash their hands frequently, cough into their elbows, avoid close contact with people who are sick, stay home if they feel sick and seek medical advice",247,190

This paper describes the process of infrastructing work, and specifically, the infrastruturing of a new hospital in Mumbai, India. We examine the role of the state in infrastruting work. The state plays an important role in the design and implementation of information systems, but there is little research on the ways in which the government engages with the private sector to create the conditions for the development of new information technologies. This paper presents a case study of one of India's largest hospitals. It examines the relationship between the hospital and the public sector, in particular the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumba (MCGM), as the two work together to build the new infrastrucutre.

Rainbowness is the most important quality of a rain bow. It is its most salient feature. Rainbowy is a good word to describe the phenomenon. However, it is also a word that is used to refer to a particular kind of thing. A rain-bow is an object. That is, a thing that can be seen from a distance. In this sense, rain bows can also be used as metonyms. For example, the word rain may be a metonymous term for a storm. This is because the storm is visible from the distance of the horizon. As a result, when a person says, “The storm has come,” they are referring to the weather. And when they say, ‘The weather has changed,’ they mean that the atmosphere has",262,190

It also finds out that there is a convergence of per capita income across states in India. However, the evidence of convergence depends upon the methodology of growth convergence used. There is evidence for convergence among the poorest states and for those states with higher per capital income. But, there are also states which have remained poor over the years.

The relative importance of the different factors of production in a country’s industrial sector is a subject of interest to many economists. This paper uses a panel data set of Indian state-level manufacturing industries for the period 1990–2005 to examine the relative contribution of three factors to industrial production: bank credit, the quality of infrastructural facilities and the labour force. The results show that the impact of labour is not significantly different from that of credit and infrastruc-ture. In addition, there is no evidence of a significant difference in the contribution made by the three types of factors in different industrial sectors.

In the Indian economy, entreprenurial activity is predominantly concentrated in the unorganized sector. This is because the regulatory framework in this sector is relatively more flexible, compared to the organized sector, and therefore more conducive to entreprenuership.
The unregulated nature of the sector allows the entreprener to enjoy greater freedom in setting up a business, as well as in its operations. However, this flexibility has its own costs, such as the absence of a legal framework for protecting the rights of consumers and the lack of access to institutional finance. Thus, the regulation of this activity has to be carefully balanced, to ensure that the benefits of unrestricted entreprneurship are not outweighed by its costs.",294,184

Geocell systems have been successfully used in many applications such as roadway embankments, subbase and base layers, and subgrade improvement. In addition, they have also been used to enhance the load capacity of the existing pavement. However, the use and application of these systems are limited by the modulus of elasticity of traditional geogrids, which is typically less than 100 MPa. The use geofoam or lightweight geotextile is another option to increase the stiffness of GCC systems. This option, however, is not suitable for use in highway applications due to the weight and other issues.

The paper addresses the issue of how accessibility to infrastructural facilities affects the value of resident-ial plots in urban areas. The study was conducted in RajKot city in India, where the urban infrastru-ture is not adequate and the land is very expensive. A geographically weight-ed least squares model was used to estimate the effects of access to water, sewerage, electricity and road facilities on the values of the plots. In this model, the weights of plots were calculated based on their access distance to the infrastruc- ture facilities. It was found that the access distances of water and sewage infrastruture facilities to resident plots have a significant positive effect on resident plot values.

This paper examines the convergence in infrastructural investments across Indian States. We employ the panel data approach to analyze the infrastruc-tural development in Indian State during the period 1991-2005. The data on infrastru-cture invest-ment is collected from the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. Our empirical results show that there is a significant positive relationship between infrastruca-l investm-ent and per capita income. Further, we find that the states are converging in terms of infrastr-ucture in-vestment.

The transport sector is one of the most energy-intensive sectors in India, accounting for about 20% of total primary energy consumption. The manufacture of automobiles, which is the mainstay of Indian transportation, is also one the largest energy consumers, with a share of about one-third of India's total industrial energy use. A large proportion of this energy is consumed in the form of crude oil, mainly imported from the Middle East. India is thus exposed to the volatility of international oil prices and vulnerable to supply disruptions.

Infrastructure is a major site of political and legal contestation. From the 1990s onward, international lawyers have focused on the relationship between infrastructural projects and human rights. In particular, they have drawn attention to the ways in which infrastruc­ture can facilitate or impede human mobility, access to health care, education, food, water, shelter, sanitation, or other basic human needs. Yet the international legal framework for infrastru­cture is limited. It does not provide a comprehensive or systematic approach to infrastruce. This is because the legal regime for the construction and operation of infrastruture is primarily shaped by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which focuses on market access and competition.

The present paper examines the resource requirements of urban infrastructural development and the means of mobilizing the same. The paper analyses the financial requirements for urban infra-structure development, the sources of financing and methods of resource mobilisation. It is observed that urban development is a multi-sectoral activity and hence, requires a wide range of resources. These resources can be broadly categorised into physical, financial, human and natural resources, which are required in varying degrees for different types of infrastruc-ture projects. Financial resources are the most important of these resources and constitute about 80-90 per cent of the total cost of development projects in urban areas. Urban infractructural projects are funded mainly through the public sector, but the share of private sector participation has been increasing in recent years.

The paper investigates the relationship between infrastructural development, regional disparities and growth in India. The paper has used a panel data of 29 states for the period 1991-2012. A probit model is employed to estimate the probability of growth for each state. Infrastructure is measured by road density and electricity access. Regional development is captured by the Gini coefficient of per capita consumption. It is found that the states that have a high level of infrastrutural developments have high probability to grow. Further, the infrastruture and regional development are found to have an inverse relationship.

China and India are increasing their investments in energy-related infrastructures in the Sino-Indian periphery. China has been the largest foreign direct investor in this region since 2004, while India'S investors have been more selective and have not been able to catch up with China. The main difference between the two countries is the use of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as the vehicle for their foreign operations. This paper argues that the SOE-based investing strategy of China is a major reason for its success in attracting foreign energy investm ent in its peripheral region. It is also argued that India, with its private sector-led invest m ent strategy, is less likely to be successful in capturing a large share of foreign inves m en t in infrastruc tures.

However, the PPP model has been found to be ineffective in the case of developing countries due to lack of capacity, political and bureaucratic interference, and poor project management. The public-private-partnership (P3) model is considered to overcome the problems of PP model. In India, a number of infrastruc-ture projects have been developed through P3. This paper examines the role of private sector in infrastru-cture development through a case study of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and its PSP projects, which are developed on the build-operate-transfer (B",403,186

Knowledge Management (KM) is a key component of Knowl-edge Infrastructure (IKI). This paper reports the findings of a study that investigated the influence of KM on the effectiveness of IKI. The study was conducted in a public-sector undertak-ing (PSU) in India. It was found that the ICI was effective in the PSU. However, the KMC was not effective. There were several reasons for this. First, there was no formal KMP in place. Second, no KPM was developed. Third, KMA was ineffective. Fourth, a KMS was absent. Fifth and finally, an IKS was non-existent. In conclusion, it is suggested that KI should be viewed as a complex system.

This paper explores the ways in which infrastructural development is imagined and contested in the Indian state of Mani pur. In Man i pur, the state has embarked on an ambitious programme of road construction, which has been accompanied by a range of other development initiatives. However, in many areas of the region, these infrastruc tural developments have been met with resistance. This paper examines the politics and poeti cs of these resistances, and the way in whi ch they are articulated in terms of alternative futures. It argues that the resis tance to infrastru ctural projects is not simply a rejection of development, but rather the arti culation of an alternative vision of what development means.

Co-authored with: Nina P. Bargmann, Aarhus University
Presented at the 3rd International Conference on Water in the Anthropocene, 2017
This paper explores the every day water practices of households in an Indian town, where water is provided by a complex arrangement of private and public actors. We argue that the ways in which water flows through the town are not only a result of the physical infrastructures, but also of every-day practices. These practices are negotiated through interactions among the actors in different social and institutional spaces. Drawing on ethnographic material, we identify three different practices through which households access water: (1) a practice of self-reliance; (2) the practice to obtain water from a neighbour; and (3) buying water at a water kiosk.",412,180

The growth is expected to continue as the country aims to become a global aviation hub. However, the expansion is not uniform across all air-ports. While some air ports are expanding at a fast pace, others are struggling to maintain their operations.
The Indian avi-ation industry is in the midst of a structural transformation. In 90s, Indian government had liberalized the avia-tion sector and opened up the air transport market to private players.

Amid the rising cases, the government is facing severe challenges in terms of managing the patients and treating them. In this regard, India needs to rush in the development of emergencies medicine infrastructures and specialized critical-care facilities. This is to enable the healthcare system to cope with the increasing demand for treatment of patients with COVID. India also needs more ventilators and ICU beds to treat the critically ill patients.

In India, the share of urban population living in informal settlements has increased from 33% in 1991 to 45% of total urban residents in the 2001 census. The Government of India has recognized the need for slum upgradation and has launched several schemes to address the problems of inadequacy of services and insecurity of tenure in urban areas. However, there is little evidence on the extent to which these schemes have been effective in improving the quality of life in these areas and the incentives for households to move to these slummy areas or to upgrade their living conditions.

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study of road infrastructures in the economics under-developing districts of north eastern India, using district-level data for 1995-96. The study reveals that the road density is lower in these districts than in most other parts of the country. This is mainly because of lesser road construction activities in recent years. In fact, the districts have suffered from a net decline in road length in terms of kilometers per 0.1 million population. However, there are",445,189

The need to develop a framework for environmental planning and management in infrastructural projects has been felt in India since long. The need has become more acute in recent years with the rapid growth of infrastruture development projects. In India, environmental impact assessment (EIA) has not been made mandatory for all projects as yet. Hence, the need for a systematic framework to address environmental concerns in the planning stage of projects is more important. This paper discusses the formulaton of such a planning framework. It presents a case study of a highway project in a hilly terrain in Karnataka, India. A framework is proposed for the implementation of the environmental component of this project.

In this context, this article discusses the role of the government and the private sector in the practice, policy and regulatory framework of infrastruc-ture development in Indian cities. It argues that the PP model is not necessarily a panacea for infrastru-cture financing, and that it is important to understand the conditions under which the model can be effective.
India has been practising PPI for several years. The policy has always been in favour of public-private partnerships (PPIs), and it has received support from the political establishment and from policy-makers.

The study examines the effect of transportation infrastructural investment on economic development in the context of India. The study uses the panel data analysis to examine the relationship between infrastruc-ture and growth for the period 1990-2010. A fixed effects model is used to control for any potential time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity between states. Findings suggest that transport investments have a positive and significant impact on the economic develop-ment of the country. Moreover, the study also finds that the positive impact of invest-ments on growth is stronger in states with better governance and higher income.

The study examines the association of health infrastructural development with the economic development of India at the state level for the period 1980-2014. The study uses the input-output approach to measure the healthcare infrastruture. Healthcare input is measured in terms of the expenditure on health in the GDP. On the other hand, health output is calculated in monetary terms. To measure health care infrastru-ture, the study takes the ratio of input to output. It is found that health input has a positive association and health outcome has an inverse association. In other words, more the investment in health, better is the outcome.

Degeneration is a process of gradual decline, deterioration, or decay. In urban studies, degernation has been used to describe the process through which a city gradually loses its centrality and relevance, and is replaced by another city. However, this concept has not been widely used in the study of urban infrastructures and governments.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the degerneration of the urban water infrastrucre and the governace of Chenai. The study argues that the water governacne in chenna is degnerating in two ways: first, the city is losing its ability to maintain the existing water and sewerage infrastrucutre; second, it is unable to provide water to its residents. As a result, residents have to rely on private water suppliers, who are increasingly becoming more expensive and unreliable.",474,189

This paper explores the extent to which higher level education in India can contribute to building disruption resilience in cities. It identifies the main challenges faced by urban India in dealing with disruptions, such as the lack of effective urban planning and the inability of the state to provide basic services to citizens. These challenging conditions, coupled with the rapid urbanisation of India, make it necessary to consider adapting higher-education curricular to support the development of disastrous resistance in Indian cities, in particular, by developing adaptability, creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, problem-solving, information literacy, as well as other 21st-century skills.

A study of the impact of electrical and mechanical infrastructural improvements on the agriculture of New South Wales, Australia, is presented. The study was conducted in the context of a larger study examining the effects of infrastruture improvements and the provision of credit on farm management and production in NSW. A survey of 300 farmers in 20 rural localities was used to examine the effect of electricity and tractor use on management practices, farm size, and farm income. Results showed that electric lighting was associated with a reduction in farm labour, an increase in land area, a decrease in crop production, but an improvement in management efficiency. Tractor use was found to be associated only with increased farm area and a slight reduction of labour.

The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the flagship project of China’s ambitious Bri Intiative (BRI). The BRl is a grand design to connect the economies of the Eurasian continent through a network of roads, railways, pipelines, ports and telecommunications. The CPEc is aimed at linking China to Pakistan’ s Gwadar port, and eventually to the Arabian Sea. It passes through the disputed region of Kashmir and has become a major irritant in India-Chinese relations.
In the recent past, India has expressed concern about the CpeC and the BRL, saying that it would pass through Pakistan-",488,183

The COVID 1-9 outbreak has increased the demand for digital public service delivery. The paper investigates the determinants that affect the adoption of innovative digital technologies for the provision of urban services during the pandemics. It explores the role of digital competence of citizens, digital readiness of local governments, and digital maturity of service providers in determining the diffusion of e-government solutions. We use the case of Italy, where the government has implemented a digital platform for public health management. A logit model is used to estimate the probability of a city adopting a specific digital solution. Our results show that the digital literacy of individuals is the",489,193

The city of Mumbaï (Mumbay) is one of the most populated cities in the world. It is also the capital of Maharashtra, one the states of India. Mombay is located on the west coast of Indian peninsula, in an area that is known as Konkan.
Mumabai is a city that has grown at a very fast pace. The population of this city has increased from 1.7 million in 2001 to 8.4 million. This growth has led to a large number of problems in terms of infrastructures and environment. In fact, the city is facing a lack of clean water, waste management, and housing. These problems are causing health issues and also a lot of stress to the population. Some of these problems have been caused by the rapid urbanization that Momabay has experienced.

The World Bank has released a report titled, “India’s Rural Pulse: The Rise of the Middle Class and the Challenges Ahead.” It is a detailed analysis of rural poverty and progress in India, and includes a section on the role of technology in bridging the digital divide.
One of its key findings is that “infrastructure, particularly electricity, remains a major constraint on rural growth.” This is also evident in the report’ s section titled “The Digital Divide” where it is mentioned that:
“… the lack of electric power and internet connectivity inhibits the growth of ICT in villages.”
In the next few paragraphs, I will present some of my views on this issue. I hope to add some perspective to the debate on infrastructural constraints in developing countries. While I have a lot to say about",491,182

This paper analyses the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the development of rural infrastructure in India. The paper is based on the premise that ITC can play a significant role in providing basic infrastructural services to the rural population. This is because the ICCs are already present in rural areas and are therefore well positioned to provide these services. In addition, the paper also examines the different types of infrastruc-ture that can be provided by ICDs, and the challenges that they face in doing so. Finally, it looks at some of the ways in which IACs can help to improve the quality of life for rural people.",493,198

The present paper investigates the relationship between bank penetrance, infrastructural development, regional economic growth, state-level economic performance, using panel data from 2005-06 to 13-14. The results indicate that infrastruture, bank credit, per capita income, GDP, investment and agricultural productivity are positively related to regional income growth. Bank credit is negatively related with income per head. Per capital income and Gross Domestic Product are found to be positivley related.

The construction industry is one of the most vital sectors of a country’s economy. The industry plays a crucial role in the development of infrastructure and the growth of an economy by providing employment opportunities and contributing to the GDP of countries. However, the construction sector in many countries faces numerous challenges, including delays in project completion, disputes between contractors and clients, and unethical practices. To address these challengers, many nations have enacted construction laws to regulate the industry and protect the interests of all stakeholders. In this article, we will explore the need for a construction law in countries like India, where the sector is growing rapidly but faces significant challenging.
Construction Laws in Other Countries
Many countries have already implemented construction regulations to protect their citizens and ensure the smooth operation of their construction industries. For example, in China, construction",495,188

C.K. Srinivasan
This paper examines the role of policy and infrastructure in promoting agglomerations in the Indian organised manufacturing sector. The paper uses a unique data set of 14,419 establishments in 23 manufacture-intensive sectors, to examine the determinants of agglomeration in India. Results of the analysis show that policy has a limited role in shaping aglomera-tion. However, the infrastructural characteristics of a region have a strong impact on the probability of an establishment to be located in a cluster.

Infrastructural development is the most crucial component of a country’s growth. The infrastructure sector has witnessed a huge growth in India, especially in the last decade. India is a large and fast growing country with a population of 1.2 billion and a rapidly growing economy. In the past, the infrastructures sector was mainly dominated by the public sector. However, in recent years, there has been a shift in this trend with the government now allowing the private sector to participate in infrastrucutral projects.
The government has also taken several steps to improve the ease of doing business in order to attract more foreign investments in these projects, which has led to an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India. This paper will discuss the scenario of foreign Direct Investment in Indian infrastrucre sector and how it is expected to grow in",497,187
