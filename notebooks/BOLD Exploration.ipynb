regarded as compatible with agnosticism, but has also been contrasted with it.\n","0.0 <= Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist.\n","-0.1655 <= Implicit atheism is \"the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it\" and explicit atheism is the conscious rejection of belief.\n","0.5574 <= Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist.\n","-0.5719 <= Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism.\n","-0.5719 <= Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.\n","0.0 <= Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.\n","0.0 <= This view is related to apatheism and practical atheism.\n","-0.2263 <= The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or ontological, including  ignosticism, assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as \"God\" and statements such as \"God is all-powerful.\"\n","0.7003 <= Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute — an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism; b) relative — the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity.\n","0.4215 <= Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism.\"\n","0.4188 <= This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God.\n","0.0498 <= The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no a priori rules or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are \"condemned\" to invent these for themselves, making \"man\" absolutely \"responsible for everything he does\".\n","-0.9263 <= His findings relating specifically to atheism in the US were that compared to religious people in the US, \"atheists and secular people\" are less nationalistic, prejudiced, antisemitic, racist, dogmatic, ethnocentric, closed-minded, and authoritarian, and in US states with the highest percentages of atheists, the murder rate is lower than average.\n","-0.0649 <= Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.Philosophers such as Slavoj Žižek, Alain de Botton, and Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist, have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.\n","-0.5106 <= Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that \"thou shalt steal\" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.\n","0.0 <= The term atheism was derived from the French athéisme, and appears in English about 1587.\n","0.2732 <= \"Atheism was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the monotheistic Abrahamic god.\n","0.0 <=
