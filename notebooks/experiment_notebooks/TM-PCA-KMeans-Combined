The impact on the economy will be positive, but the implementation has to be done in a smooth manner.\\nThe impact will vary from sector to sector, and from state to state. Some sectors will benefit and some will lose out. This will happen in both the short term and long term. In the long run, the impact is likely to benefit the country as a whole. But in short-term, there will likely be a negative impact, especially in securities. As a result, companies may need to re-evaluate their business strategies. It is also likely that the new tax regime will increase the cost of doing business. However, this will not affect the overall economy in India. GST is expected to have a positive impact.

The book discusses the impact of the two on the economy in terms of growth in output and employment, the composition of capital formation, and its distribution in income and wealth. It also deals with the effects of these developments on public investment and public sector development.\\nThe book also traces the evolution of two distinct modes of private investments, viz., monopsony and monpoly, in India and examines their relative contribution to the expansion of output, employement and capital accumulation in different sectors of economy. This is done in a way which avoids the usual confusions in conceptualisation of such investmens.

The analysis is based on the System Dynamics (SD) model of economic development. This model is used to analyze the complex interrelationships between the various economic sectors and infrastruc- ture in India. It is found that the economy of India is characterized by a low level of per capita income, low levels of savings and investment, and high levels oi inflation. These problems are associated with a high level o f infrastru- cure deficit. In order to reduce the infrastrure gap, the government has initiated a number of policy measures to promote infrastrural develop- ment.

It discusses the factors that motivate migrating households to move from rural to urban areas, and the implication of this movement on the economic welfare of the migrated households. While the migration is motivated by the desire for higher income, it is also associated with the loss of social capital, which is a major cause of poverty in rural India.

It is also a developing country. In the last few decades, it has made remarkable progress in terms of economic growth. But this growth is not evenly distributed. Some regions and some groups of people are benefiting more from the growth than others. There is the danger of the poor falling further behind the rich. This situation has given rise to a new social movement called the Right to Development. A new paradigm is emerging. Instead of focusing on growth alone, the new focus is on inclusive and sustainable development\",\"the indian industrial relations system: struggling to address the dynamics of a globalizing economy\\nAmit Basole\\nThe Indian industrial relation system is facing a crisis. The traditional tripartite model of industrial democracy, wherein the state, employers and trade unions collectively negotiate labour policies, is under severe stress. It is no longer able to respond to the challenges of the global economy, which is characterized by increased labour flexibility and the predominance of non-unionized and informal employment. This article examines the key challengers to this system, and argues that the current crisis is a result of structural changes in the economy that are undermining the foundations of tri-partism. To overcome this crisis, the article suggests that a new system of labour policy needs to be established, in which the government and employer associations are the main actors, with the trade union movement playing a more marginal role.\\nIndia\\u2019s industrial economy is currently undergoing a structurally-indu\",\"the impact of covid-19 on e-wallet's payments in indian economy\\nE-Wallet Payments\\nThe pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital paying methods.

This article argues that the Indian state has failed to constrain the violence because it has deliberately left it unregulated by the law. In India, elective violence is not only a criminal activity but a legitimate political tool. It is a means of winning elections, and the state and political parties often benefit from it. The article compares electorally motivated violence with electively motivate violence.\\nBased on fieldwork in West Bengal and Odisha, the article demonstrates that electorial violence has a structural basis.

It is also the largest democracy in human history. Yet, the very idea that India is a country has come under attack in recent years, especially from within the country.\\nThe Envisionment of A Nation is an attempt to explain why this is so. What is it about the concept of India that has led to its rejection by so many people? The book takes a long historical perspective to answer this question, and traces the origins of this idea to the eighteenth century. The author argues that the Indian idea has been a source of inspiration for many thinkers, including the founding fathers of modern India, who drew on the ideas of Enlightenment philosophers like Montesquieu and Rousseau to construct a new nation. He also examines\",\"in defence of indian perspective of multiculturalism\\nI have been reading about the Indian perspective on multiculuralisim and how it is different from the Western perspective.\\nIt is true that there are some differences. The western perspective is based on the assumption that the individual is the unit of analysis and not the society. It is also based upon the idea that all cultures are equal and that they are in competition with each other. Therefore, it assumes that multicultural societies are inherently unstable. This is a very misleading assumption. In fact, multcultral societes are not inherantly unstabe. They are only unstabale if they have a weak political system. If the political systems are strong, then multculural socities can be stable. India is an example of a multulcual society that is stable despite having a large number of different cultrues.

In recent years, the economy had been experiencing a high growth rate, which has come down to a single digit in 2012. This fall in the growth rates is mainly attributed to the decline in demand in both the domestic and the global markets.\\nThe economy also faces the problems of high inflation, fiscal deficit, current account defi cit and slowing growth in exports.

Using annual data from 1970 to 2005, we find that energy has a significant positive impact on income, but the effect is insignificant in the long run. In addition, the result indicates that the positive effect of income on energy is significant in both the short and long-run. However, energy does not affect income in either the immediate or long term.

The debate has centred on whether economic reforms have helped to increase the rate of economic development in the country, and if so, by how much. This paper presents a systematic analysis of the empirical evidence on this issue. We find that the data do not support the view that economic reform has led to an acceleration in economic activity.\\nThe paper is based on a study of all the papers published in 10 major journals in economics over the last 20 years. These papers are classified into those that are pro-reform and those which are anti-liberalisation. It is found that, while the proponents of liberalism have published more papers than the opponents, the number of papers that support liberal reform is less than 50% of those published by the opposers.

The study analyses the effects of economic activity on energy demand, CO\\u2082 emission and their implications on economic welfare. It is argued that there is a trade-off between the two. While economic activities lead to an increase in energy and CO2 emission, they also lead an improvement in the standard of living of the people. However, the paper argues that the adverse effects on environment outweigh the benefits of increased economic output. This is because the level of CO 2 emitted in a country is not only a function of its economic level but also of other factors such as the technological level, energy intensity and the type of fuels used for energy generation. These factors determine the environmental impact of a given level and type economic performance.

We study the impact of biometrics-enabled smart cards, which were rolled out to provide cash transfers to over 600 million Indian citizens in 12 states. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the rollout of smart card pay-ments reduced the incidence of corruption in the program, increased the quality of the service provided, and improved the accuracy of benefit delivery. In addition, the introduction of crypto-graphic signatures improved program efficiency, reducing the time taken to deliver benefits and improving the timeliness of benefits to beneficiaries.

A positive causative relationship means that the effect of one factor on the other is positive.\\nThis type is most commonly found in the field of economics. It is also used in other fields such as psychology, sociology and education. In economical terms, it is the relationship of cause and effect between two variables.

The analysis is based on the concept of interindustrial linkage, which has been defined as the extent of dependence of one industry on another industry in the production of the same or similar product. It is argued that the economic development of a country is dependent on a set of factors, namely, the size of population, natural resources, level of capital formation, technological development, and the rate of productivity growth. These factors are also interrelated and have a bearing on each other. A simple model is used to examine the interrelationships among these factors. In the model, there are two industries, say, agriculture and manufacture. Manufacture is a dependent industry and agricultural products are inputs in manufactures. This model has two important implications: (1) the growth of agriculturally-based indust\\u00adries is not necessarily inhibited by\",\"Psychological climate and individual performance in India: test of a mediated model\\nEva M.

The country has emerged as a global player in terms of economic performance. India has achieved impressive growth rates, with a per capita income that has more than doubled over a period of 10 years. This rapid economic growth has been achieved despite the fact that India is a developing country. Developing countries are those which have low per capital incomes, low levels of industrialization, and high levels unemployment. In addition, they are characterized by low savings rates and low rates of investment. On the other hand, developed countries have high per-capita in-comes and are highly industrialized.

The spatial pattern of trade is the result of a complex interaction of several factors. These factors include the size of markets, the level of development of different regions, and their geographical location. In India, commo-dity distribution is affected by a number of factors, including the type of product, its value, location, size, shape, texture, etc. This paper examines the role of these factors in the distribution and flow of goods in India.

This is because the regulatory framework in this sector is relatively more flexible, compared to the organized sector, and therefore more conducive to entreprenuership.\\nThe unregulated nature of the sector allows the entreprener to enjoy greater freedom in setting up a business, as well as in its operations. However, this flexibility has its own costs, such as the absence of a legal framework for protecting the rights of consumers and the lack of access to institutional finance. Thus, the regulation of this activity has to be carefully balanced, to ensure that the benefits of unrestricted entreprneurship are not outweighed by its costs.\",\"the harvard project on american indian economic development\\nHISTORY OF THE HPAIED\\nTHE HARVARD PROJECT ON AMERICAN INDIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (HPAIED)\\nThe Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development (the Project) was founded in 1993 by Professor John Friedmann of the Harvard Graduate School of Design (GSD) and Professor James Peacock of Harvard Law School (HLS).

In such a scenario, it is very important for the central banks to adopt a mono-policies in order to control the economic activities of the country. A monopoly of a particular currency in a country leads to a situation where the mon-etarist policy is adopted by the government. Monet-arism is the most important tool for controlling inflation and unemployment in an economy. This is because, inflations and employment are the two most common problems faced by a modern economy (Lucas, 1976).

Second, technological innovations, such as the steam engine, led to the development of a wide range of new industries.

The study has been conducted in the backdrop of various economic, political and social issues in developing countries. In the study, the financial and non-financial sectors are taken into consideration. Using secondary data, this study examines the relationship between the level of development of banking and other financial institutions and the rate of economic progress in Indian economy. For this purpose, various financial indicators such as bank credit, bank deposits, non bank financial institution credit and money supply have been considered. Further, economic indications such gross domestic product, gross capital formation, private investment, government investments and foreign direct invest-ment have also been used as indicative of progress. These variables are regressed on a time series basis using a dynamic panel data estimation technique.

The sector has grown at a faster pace than the formal sector, though its growth rate has slowed down in recent years.\\nInformal workers are not covered by any social security schemes and are vulnerable to economic shocks. However, the informational sector is an important source of employability for the large number of workers who are unable to get formal jobs. In addition, it provides a source for a large proportion of income for many households. It is also an opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship. Informal firms are an integral part of economic growth and development. They are a major source not only of jobs, income and growth but also of innovations and technological change. A large share of informally employed workers in developing countries, especially in Asia, are self-employed in small-scale, mostly unregistered fir ms.

It is used to simulate the economic performance of the country for the period 01.04.1991 to 31 March 94, with a time horizon of 5 years.\\nThe results of simulation show that the economy is quite sensitive to the external conditions.

However, there is a decline in growth rate of service sector as a whole and construction sector in particular.

The objective of liberalizing capital markets is to improve the efficiency of resource allocation by enhancing competition and reducing information asymmetries.\\nIn India, the liberalized capital accounts have facilitated greater flows of foreign capital and improved access to domestic financial mark-ets. As a result, there has been a significant increase in cross-border portfolio investment in India. However, it is not clear whether the gains from liberalised capital inflows have outweighed the costs. In this paper, we investigate the effects of capital liberaliza-tion on the Indian economy.

This was a response to a severe balance of payments crisis, which threatened to undermine the country's political stability.

It was resolved by a massive injection of foreign capital into the economy, through the sale of shares in public enterprises, and by the withdrawal of government controls over the domestic economy in order to attract foreign investment.\\nThis book provides a critical analysis of these reforms.

India has been a socialist country for decades and it is still the largest socialistic country in the world. The socialism has resulted in many social problems. One of the major problems is poverty. Poverty is an important issue for the Indian economy. It is one of those problems which have to be solved by the government. There are many ways to solve this problem. But the most important one is to reform the economic system. Economic reform is the key to the solution of poverity. In this paper we will discuss about the ideas that have been proposed to re-form the economy of India. We will also discuss the impact of these ideas on the development of Indian society.

The first round of re-form, in the early 80s, was aborted in 4-5 years. A second round, launched in July 90, has made considerable progress, but is still in its early stages. In the process, it has become clear that grad-ualist reflation of the economy, a key part of this reform package, is not a panacea for the Indian economic ills.\\nIt is now well accepted that the key to growth in India is the restructuring of its economy. This is because the economic growth of India in recent years has not been a result of growth-oriented investment, as in China, or a growth strategy based on exports, like that of East Asian countries. Rather, growth has come from a combination of both, with a large and growing share of it being a consequence of increased consumption.\",\"social entrepreneurship: a growing trend in indian economy\\nThe Indian economy is witnessing a rapid transformation. The economic growth of the country has made it the sixth largest economy in the world. This is due to the fact that India has a large population of young people who are well educated and are increasingly becoming aware of their social responsibilities.\\nSocial entreprenuership is a new trending concept in India which is gaining popularity among young entreprenurs. It is an initiative taken by the government to encourage entreprenship and entreprennership among the youth.

Union of India, was first introduced in raped act 375, 52, as a provision in law, after the 41 years of the judicial decision. Marital rap is a sexual intercourse with a wife without her consent, and it is considered as an offence under Section 6 of IPC, in which the husband can be punished with 7 years imprisonment. The Supreme court of indian in this case held that sexual act with wife is not raper, because it has been accepted by our culture and religion.

The share of manufactures in GDP has increased from 16.5 percent in 2004-05 to 30 percent by 4Q 09. This paper examines the role of investment and investor-specific factors in explaining the growth of India' s manufacture exports. We find that investments in infrastructure and human capital are positively associated with the export growth. Further, the level of domestic investors' participation in investing in exporting firms is found to be positivity associated. However, we find no significant association between the investee fir''s foreign ownership and export performance.\\nDive into the research topics of 'Investments and exports in Indian manufacturers: Innovation and the quality of capital'.

This paper investigates the long-run relationship and short-term causal relationship of energy and GDP in India. The analysis is based on the time series data of primary energy supply and real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the period 1971-2015. We used co-integration analysis and Error Corrections Modeling (ECM) to investigate the relationship. Results from the cointegrating regression and ECM suggest that there is a long run relationship, but the causation runs from GPD to energy. It also indicates that the energy use is not a driving force for economic activity in this case.\",\"where's the glue? institutional and cultural foundations of american indian economic development\\nThe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, as amended, has provided a legal framework for the expansion of tribal gaming enterprises. However, tribally-owned casinos and resorts are still relatively rare. In the first half of the 20th century, the federal government tried to suppress tribals' economic activity. Today, however, there are more than 300 tribaly-operated casino and bingo facilities in 64 states. This book argues that the success of Indian gambling is due to the combination of a favorable legal and regulatory framework and the cultural and institution- al characteristics of American Indians.\\n1.

This shortcoming is not because of an inadequate supply of workers, but because the demand for skilful workers is growing faster than the supply. The gap is widening and it is estimated that by 2022, there will be a deficit of 11 million skillful labourers.\\nIndia has a growing economy and a young population. However, its educational system is unable to provide the required number of highly skiled labour force. In fact, the number has been decreasing. Many young people leave the country to work abroad. And, in the meantime, they are not replaced by new workers.

There are many reasons for this, and one of them is the fact that more and more women are starting to see the potential for social change through entreprenuership.\\nThere are also a number of other factors that have contributed to the rise of women in social enterprise, such as the increasing number women who are now going to college and the growing number who have access to education and resources. In addition, there has also been an increase in women-led startups, which is another factor that is helping to drive the trends.

This paper examines the impact of these refor-mations on the efficiency of Indian manufacturers, using a panel of 457 firms in the manufactu-ring sector between 2001 and 02. The empirical analysis employs the nonpara-metric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method to estimate the technical efficiency scores of each firm. We find that the reformation program has improved the overall efficiency in Indian manu facturing. In addition, the improvement in efficiency is not uniform across sectors and firm size. Our results show that reorganization of government bureaucracy, deregulation of capital markets, and trade liberaliza-tion have been the most important factors in increasing efficiency.\\nKeywords: India\",\"causality between energy consumption and economic growth in india: a note on conflicting results\\nThe causal relationship between economic development and energy use has been the subject of much debate in recent years. In particular, the relationship has attracted the attention of environmental economists who have argued that energy efficiency is an important component of economic policy in the transition to a low-carbon economy. This paper attempts to shed light on the causation between the two variables by examining the literature on India, a country which is often cited as an example of a developing country that has achieved high economic performance with low energy intensity. The results of the analysis indicate that the evidence is inconclusive and that it is not possible to reject the null hypothesis of no causational relationship.\\nA. A. K. Sarkar\\nM. M.

It is proposed to be levied at all stages right from manufacture to final consumption with credit of taxes paid at previous stages available as set-off. The GST is expected to subsume a large number of Central and State tax laws, including the Central Excise Duty, the Additional Excises Dutiy (AED), the Service Tax, Central Sales Tax and the State Value Added Tax.\\nIn the GDP calculations, it is assumed that the final consumer price will be the same as the price at which the goods are produced. This is not the case in the real world. As a result, Gross Domestic Product is an overestimate of the actual production in a country. Therefore, when GDPT is used as a measure of economic growth, there is always a possibility that\",\"goods and services tax: a milestone in indian economy\\nGST is the most significant tax reform in India since the independence. It is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every value addition. The tax is collected at every stage of supply of goods or services, right from the manufacturing stage to the retail stage.\\nThe tax was introduced in the country on 1st July 2017. This tax replaced multiple taxes levies by the central and state governments. GST was implemented in a phased manner. Initially, GSTR 3B was filed for July and August 5. Then, the filing of GTR 6 was started from September. Now, all the taxpayers are required to file GTS 8. However, tax filings for the month of July are still on.

The capital of the economy is invested in the various sectors of economy, in order to earn the return on it. A return is obtained on capital investment when the investor is able to sell the capital at a higher price than the cost price of capital. This is done through the process of investing in various assets like shares, bonds, gold, silver, etc. Investment in capital assets is known as capitalization. Capitalization is a process by which an investors earns the profit on his investments. There are various factors that influence the price at which the asset is sold. These factors are called as the determinants of asset price.\",\"qualitative input\\u2013output analysis of the indian economic structure: a case study of madhya pradesh\\nThe Indian economy is facing a serious problem of unemployment and underempment.

The Government has been making concerted efforts to achieve this objective and has initiated far-reaching structural reforms in various sectors of the economy, particularly in agriculture and industrial sector. It is also important to note that the country has experienced significant macro-econonomic instability in recent years. This is due to the fact that India has a dual economy in which the two seperate seamless markets in industrial and agricultural goods are intertwined with each other. As a result, the policy makers have to take into account both the short term and the long term objectives while framing the economic policies. In the past, India had followed a policy of price control and administered prices. However, in view of macro\",\"shocks, economic growth, and the indian economy\\nEconomic growth and its impact on employment\\nIn this paper, we examine the impact of economic development on the employ- ment structure.

This has resulted in a shift away from coal and natural gas towards these cleaner sources of energy. The Indian electricity sector is the largest consumer of coal in India, accounting for 70% of total energy consumption. Coal is used to generate electric power in thermal power plants, and is also used as a fuel for industrial processes.

The standard interpretation of Indian economic growth in this period is based primarily on two sources of evidence: the accounts of Arab merchants and the archaeological evidence of coins and pottery. These sources are used to support the view that India was a relatively prosperous economy in which agricultural production was supplemented by trade in a variety of manufactured goods. This article argues that the evidence on which the current view is founded is not as robust as has been thought.\\nFingerprint Dive into the research topics of 'towards a reconceptualization of india'S economic decline in early medieval times'.

The study uses monthly data from January 1995 to December 2010. A set of four variables namely, industrial production, consumer price index, money supply and foreign exchange reserves are used to examine the cointegration relationship. Using the Engle-Granger two-step procedure, the study finds the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between industrial output and money. However, there is no evidence of long run equilibrium between CPI and Money. Further, using the Granger Causality test, it is found that industrial growth causes money growth and the reverse is not true. Similarly, Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) causes industrial and consumer prices and vice versa.

It explores the relationship between the colonial administration and the medical profession in the context of a colonial health policy that was predicated on a model of preventive medicine. The article argues that the introduction of malariology and its adoption as the key component of British India\\u2019s public health strategy was a crucial part of this policy. In this sense, the article reconsiders the role of colonial medicine in terms of its contribution to the emergence of modern epidemiology. At the same time, it also re-examines how the discipline of epistemology is intertwined with the practice of medicine and public policy, and how this was influenced by the political and economic context.\",\"the political economy of technological innovation in indian agriculture\\nAgriculture is the largest sector of the Indian economy. The sector accounts for about 15% of GDP, employs about half the workforce and contributes about a third of total exports. It is also the single largest source of income for over 60% rural households. Yet, the sector has been in a state of stagnation for the last two decades.\\nIn this article, we explore the politics of agricultural innovations in India. Innovations are essential to boosting agriculturally-led growth, which is a key policy objective in the country. However, in recent years, innovative capacity has declined. There has also been a fall in investment in agricultual research and development, and a decline in public funding of R\u0026D. This has had a negative impact on agricultury, especially on the small farmers.

Sharma\\nThe 1980s have seen a rapid growth in the production of scientific and technological knowledge in India. This growth has been accompanied by a growing interest in science and technology in both the public and private sectors. The growth of science is due to the increase in funding, and also to a greater emphasis on science education. There has also been an expansion in scientific research and development (R\u0026D), and in technology development. These developments have led to an increase of the number of scientists, engineers and technical personnel, as well as to increased attention to science policy issues.\\nSharma, A.

It contributes about 17% to the GDP, 45% of total exports, and 26% total employment. In addition, it provides food and nutrition security to 60% population of India. The agriculturists are the most vulnerable and hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemics.\\nAgriculture is one of those sectors that has been hit hard by COVID 9.

Oil prices are also a major factor in determining the economic outlook for India, as it is a large importer of petroleum products.\\nIn this article, we will take a look at the history of global oil price fluctuations and how it has impacted the Indian economy over the years. We will also discuss the factors that influence oil pricing and what they mean for the future of Indian oil imports. Finally,\\nWhat are the key drivers of change in oil markets?\\nThere are a number of key factors driving change within the oil industry.

The analysis is based on a review of literature on economic and cultural development. It examined the importance of culture in economic decision making and its impact on social, political and institutional development in India and other countries. A conceptual framework was developed to identify the role of values and institutions in the process of economic change. An empirical investigation was conducted to test the hypotheses. Data were collected from 2004 to 1998 for 30 Indian states and the Indian Union. Findings show that culture is an important factor in explaining the differences in state economic performances. In particular, the study found that the values of cooperation and consensus, which are prevalent in Indian culture, are associated with lower rates of growth. On the other hand, value of competition, associated in Western culture with high economic achiev\",\"asia before europe: economy and civilisation of the indian ocean from the rise of islam to 1750\\nThe world has long been familiar with the economic and cultural achievements of Europe and Asia. But the history of Asia before Europe has been largely ignored. The result is a skewed view of world history, which makes the discovery of America and the European conquest of India and China appear to be the most important events of their time. This book provides a new perspective on the civilizations of South and Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and East Asia from 600 to the present. It describes the long-term processes that gave rise to a distinctive civilization in each region, traces the development of a trading network that linked the regions, demonstrates the importance of this network in the growth of civilizational centers, examines the role of China in this process, shows how the network was disrupted by the advent of Islam, describes how this disruption was overcome by local innovations,\",\"the impact of macroeconomic indicators on indian stock prices: an empirical analysis\\nAshok Kumar and S.K.

In order to examine this relationship, we use the vector error correction model (VECM). The results show that the Indian stock returns are cointegrated with macro variables. The long-run elasticities of the stock return with respect to the macro indication are negative, implying that Indian economy is not in a position to absorb the shocks of adverse macro economic conditions. This result is in line with the findings of previous studies.\\nThe impacts Of macro Economic Indicators On Indian Stock Prices: An Empirical Analysis\\nAn Emprirical Study On The Impact Of Macroeconomics On Stock Market Of Pakistan\\nEmpirically Examining the Implications of Macro-Economy on the Stock Markets of Pakistan\",\"How infrastructure and financial institutions affect agricultural output and investment in India\\nJournal : Journal of Development Economics, Volume 85, Issue 1, January 2008, Pages 62\\u201379\\n- \\u0627\\u0631\\u0632\\u06cc\\u0627\\u0628\\u06cc \\u0633\\u0631\\u0645\\u0627\\u06cc\\u0647 \\u06af\\u0630\\u0627\\u0634\\u062a\\u0647 - \\u0628\\u0627\\u0632\\u0627\\u062a -\\nInfrastructure investments, Agricultural investements, Bazaar,\\nThis paper analyzes the relationship between agriculture and infrastructural development in Indian states.

It is an important macro economic variable which affects the economic performance. In India inflations has been a major problem for the last few decades. High inflatioon rate has resulted in many macro-econmic problems such as decline in the rate of savings, increase the interest rates, declining of investment, etc. This paper has tried to analyse the effect of high inflaton rate in India. Various inflatoin indices have been used to measure the inflatton rate.

It has been hit by a combination of factors: the financial crisis, the slowdown in the US and Europe, and a slowing domestic economy.\\nAmidst the gloom, there are some silver linings. The government has taken a number of measures to deal with the situation, including cutting interest rates, increasing liquidity, providing funds to banks, relaxing FDI norms and increasing the money supply. These measures have been effective in stabilising the economy and helping it recover from the shocks. However, they are not enough to revive the growth rate. India needs to undertake structural reforms to boost investment and growth. This will require political will and decisive action from policymakers. In the short term, India should focus on boosting exports, reducing its trade deficit, improving the infrastructure,\",\"the political economy of indian power sector reforms\\nThe Political Economy of Indian Power Sector Reforms: Implications for Policy Reform in Developing Countries\\nRajendra Prasad, Pramod Kumar, and Shikha Jha\\nThis paper examines the factors that explain the implementation of revenue-raising and expenditure-cutting regressive re-forms in India's power industry in the 1990s. The paper finds that the recessionary effects of the power refor-mations were exacerbated by the fact that they were introduced at a time when the Indian economy was experiencing a severe downturn. It also finds the presence of a large number of unreformed, inefficient, loss-making, state-owned enterprises that were competing with the reformed, efficient, profit-oriented private sector companies.

Raju\\nThe relationship between lighting activity, and the projecting change of climate is studied for the first time over Indian Sub-Continent. The relationship is analysed using the lightening data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall data. A significant correlation is observed between the number of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightnings and rainy days over India. It is also found that the CG lightings are more frequent during the monsoon season and during early post mono-soonal period. In the present study, the relationship of CG and CG-IC (intra-cloud) flashes with the raining days is found to be significant. However, CG flash density and IC flash densities are not found significant over this region.

It draws on a qualitative study conducted in 2009 in three Indian states, which sought to understand how climate information and adaptation practices were being developed, used and disseminated. This paper focuses on the persistence of uncertainty in the face of climate uncertainty, but also explores the way inwhich uncertainty is understood and acted upon, particularly by communities. In doing so, the paper considers the extent to which communities are able to identify, articulate and respond to the uncertainty that climate science has produced. The paper concludes by considering the implications for adaptation practice, in terms of how uncertainty should be understood, how it should inform adaptation planning and what this means\",\"Simulation of impact of projected climate change on wheat in India\\nAkhtar, A. and Bhardwaj, R.

Dash, Sushil Kumar\\nThis study presents a comparative analysis of mid-latitude winter temperature variabilities in two distinct regions, the south Indian region (SIR) and the southern tropical Pacific region, using proxy data from the last 705 years. The SIR is characterized by a monsoon circulation pattern and is influenced by the El Ni\\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), while the tropical southern Pacific is a region of persistent El Nino-like conditions. We have used a set of 22 proxy records to reconstruct the winter (JJA) temperature anomalies in these regions. These data were subjected to a wavelet analysis to estimate the power spectrum of the regressed temperature series. This analysis reveals that the Southeast Asian\",\"Calibrated simulation analysis for integration of evaporative cooling and radiant cooling system for different Indian climatic zones\\nThe present work focuses on the simulation and analysis of the evaporation coolers and the radiative panel system in the Indian context.

But the rain is not. The metaphors are important.\\nRainbowness is the most important quality of a rain bow. It is its most salient feature. Rainbowy is a good word to describe the phenomenon. However, it is also a word that is used to refer to a particular kind of thing. A rain-bow is an object. That is, a thing that can be seen from a distance. In this sense, rain bows can also be used as metonyms. For example, the word rain may be a metonymous term for a storm. This is because the storm is visible from the distance of the horizon.

The IM rainstorms are one of most important sources of monetary losses in India, and are a key component of agricultural productivity in many parts of India. It is therefore important to understand the nature of Indian IM precipitations and their variability under different climate scenarios.\\nIn the present study, we have used the outputs of 12 different global climate models (GCMs) to examine the changes in IM rain precipitations in a warming world. We have analysed the precipitative responses to climate forcing in 20 and 40 years from now, as well as in doubled CO2 conditions. In addition, the response of IM to changes\",\"The Indian Ocean dipole\\u2013the unsung driver of climatic variability in East Africa\\nThe Indian ocean dipoles (IODs) are among the most prominent modes of climate variabilities in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. However, their influence on climate in Eastern Africa has remained elusive. Here, we show that the IOD is the primary driver for the observed climate anomalies in Kenya and Tanzania. We used the 100-year reanalysis dataset to show how the Indian monsoon and East African rainfall are controlled by the strength of the dipolediabatic heating. The diabatically heated air is transported towards the equator and causes the atmospheric divergence, which drives the monopole diurnal circulation. This diversion of air masses in turn modulates the rains over East and Southern Africa. Our results indicate that while the East Indian Oscillation (EIO) is a strong driver\",\"Climate change and malaria in India\\nMarch 2014: Climatic changes and the spread of malarial disease in Bihar, India.\\nThe study was published in the journal Malaria Journal.

The monthly performance analysis is carried out using MATLAB and Simulink for a typical Indian location. A detailed energy analysis for each collecting element is performed and the results are compared with the month-wise energy output of the PV system. It is observed that PT collecter performs better than the photolume and PVC collecters. In case of PTC, the energy collected by the collective elements is stored in a thermal storage tank. Hence, it is used to produce the required energy in winter season. This helps in increasing the overall energy yield of a PTS system by 1\",\"A high-resolution, absolute-dated deglacial speleothem record of Indian Ocean climate from Socotra Island, Yemen\\nS. M. G.

Here we present new proxy records from the western Himalaya (Garhwal region, India) that extend the existing database, and which allow us to reconstruct the glacial mono-soonal variabil- ity in the region. We also present results from a series of climate model experiments that shed light on the potential causes of this vari- ability. Our results show that glaciers in this region are strongly sensitive to climate variations, particularly during the last gla- cial maximum. The model results suggest that the North African-Saharan desert was drier than today during glacio-evolutionary periods, which may have enhanced the moisture transport to South Asian mon- soon regions.

It is found that the SAM is strongly associated with the surface wind stress in all regions, with a particularly strong relationship in winter. This is associated in turn with changes in sea level pressure and the winds in these regions. The relationship is not linear, however, but is more complex and is characterized by two dominant modes of variability. These are associated respectively with positive and negative SST anomalies in each region. In the Atlantic and Eastern Indian, these modes are also associated, respectively, positive or negative,\",\"Palaeolatitudes and the age of Indian laterites\\nE. A. F.

The ITF is strongly influenced by seasonal and interannal variations in the strength of the trade winds. In this study, we investigate the impact of inter-annually varying ITCZs on the ITP over a 26-year period (1986\\u20132011) using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. We find that the intermittency of trade-wind-induced ITVs is not directly related to changes in surface wind stress. Instead, it is associated with changes of air-sea fluxes, which are governed by oceanic and atmospheric processes. Intermitentcy is controlled by a combination of processes that are associated to ocean-atmosphere coupling, such as ocean dynamics, ocean mixed layer depth, surface\",\"Theoretical energy saving analysis of air conditioning system using heat pipe heat exchanger for Indian climatic zones\\nV.S. Kumar, R. Ramesh, S. Senthilkumar\\nThe present work deals with the theoretical analysis on the energy savings of the air-conditioning systems using a heat-pipe heat exchange. The energy analysis is carried out for the different climates in India. In the present study, a theoretical model is developed to calculate the efficiency of a typical air handling unit (AHU) with heat pipes in an air distribution system. A theoretical study is done to analyze the performance of heat pump heat recovery system (HPHRS) in Indian climate. An HPHRS is a system that recovers heat from the exhaust air of an AHUs and uses it to preheat the fresh air supplied to the AU. To analyze HPHPR system, the temperature profile of exhaust and fresh streams is calculated using the heat balance method. For the Indian conditions, it is observed that the\",\"Impact of climate change on rainfed agriculture in India: a case study of Dharwad.\\nAuthor: S. B. Patil, Bharathi S., Suresh Bhat, Shrinivas K.

Rao\\nIn tropical regions, the thermal environment is characterized by high temperatures and high humidity. The human body has a limited ability to dissipate heat, and it is therefore necessary to provide cooling for thermal well-being. In this paper, a thermal discomfort model has been developed to predict the disconfort level experienced by a person in a tropical environment. This model is based on the psychophysiological and physiologically equivalent temperature concepts. A new method has also been proposed to determine the appropriate value of the equivalent thermal resistance (ETR) of a human. It is found that the physio-equivalent temperature (PET) is higher than the thermophy-siological equivalent temperate (TET), and the PET is also higher in the evening than in mornings. An ETR value (0.124) has therefore\",\"Supporting blue economy agenda: fisheries, food security and climate change in the Indian Ocean\\nSustainable fishing, marine conservation and food systems are key for a blue and green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the uncertainty in hydrogeological parameters, which is another important factor affecting the hydroenvironment, has been rarely considered in the literature. In this study, we use a Bayes' theorem-based method to quantify the parameter uncertainties in an integrated hydroeconomic model (IHEM) and assess the impacts of the unmeasured hydro geological parameter variations on the river discharge of major Indian rivers. The results show that the IHEMS can capture the overall trends in river flow, but it is unable to accurately reproduce\",\"Sensitivity analysis of a climate vulnerability index-a case study from Indian watershed development programmes\\nAshish Kumar Sharma, D.

The objective of this study is to assess the sensitivity of the indicative climate sensitive indications with respect to the vulnerabilty index. For this purpose, we have used the data of 1330 watersheds of Indian states of Haryana and Rajasthan. In the present study, four climate indices, viz. temperature, rainfall, runoff and evaporation, have being used to determine the impact of climate on agriculture. These indices have then been used for determining the overall vulnerablity index for the watersheeds. A sensitvity analysis has been carried out for these climate indicies. It is found that the rainy season rains have the maximum impact on the agricultural production, while the run off and temperature\",\"Variability of climate change in India: An assessment based on different climate models\\nThe authors present an analysis of the climate of India and the variability in the projections of future climate under different models. The analysis is based upon the CMIP3 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3) database, which contains 16 models and 21 ensembles of simulations for the period 00-099. A number of indices of temperature and precipitation are computed for different seasons, regions and timescales. It is found that the spatial pattern of changes in precipitations is more complex than that of temperatures, with some regions experiencing increases in rainfall and others decreases. However, the magnitude of change is not uniform across the country.

However, the extent to which climate concerns are addressed in spatial planning is not well understood. This paper presents an evaluation tool to assess the level of climate integration in the spatial development plans of Indian urban areas. The evaluation includes both a qualitative assessment of the plans, based on a set of indicators, as well as a quantitative analysis of plan-related information. It is found that the majority of plans do not include climate-sensitive indications. While the indication of miti- gation actions is generally weak, adaptation is more prevalent. In addition, it is demonstrated that adaptation indic- ations are more likely to be included in plans when there is a greater degree of stakeholder involvement\",\"Passive adaptation to climate change among Indian farmers\\nGajanan N.

The model has a 1.44\\u00b0 resolution in both the ocean and the atmosphere, and is forced by both orbiter and radiative forcing. The orbitor forcing is a combination of both precession and obliquity, while the radiati ve forcing consists of a CO2 forcing and an orbite r forcing that is similar to the orbitu r oblique forcing, but with a lower magnitude. Our model shows that the predominant effect of obliquit y is to increase the intensity of summer mon- soons, which is in agreement with previous model studies.

It is caused by an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, which traps heat and causes global warming. The earth's climate is changing at a faster rate than ever before, and this is having a significant impact on agriculture in India. Climatic changes have caused a decline in crop yields, increased frequency and severity of droughts, floods, heat waves, cyclones, etc. This has led to an increased demand for food security and adaptation measures. In this blog post, we will discuss how climate change has affected Indian agricultural practices and what can be done to mitigate its effects. We will also look at how India is responding to climate-related challengers in agricultures. By understanding these issues, you can better prepare for any potential future changes in climate that may affect\",\"Farmers' perceptions of climate change, impacts on freshwater aquaculture and adaptation strategies in climatic change hotspots: A case of the Indian Sundarban \\u2026\\nThe study explores the perceptual gaps between scientists and farmers regarding the impact of climactic change on the fresh water aqua culture.

The impact of global warming on Indian climate is evident in changes in rainy seasons, floods, droughts, and extreme heat. These changes have a cascading impact in terms of crop yield, livestock production, human health, food security, etc. In addition, the impacts of extreme weather events are exacerbated by the growing population, urbanisation, industrialisation and land degradation. Thus, India is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climatic variabilities and changes.

The present desert area of 200,040 sq. km. was formed in the Quarternary and covers about 80% of Rajastan. This paper discusses the late Quartenary vegetational and climatic history based on the evidence of pollen, macrofossils and lithology. It is concluded that the vegetal cover of this region has been very sparse during the Pleistocene and Holocen and that there has always been a desert-like environment. However, the desert has undergone a series of changes in its extent and vegetative cover since the last glacial maximum. At the present time, there is a gradual increase in vegetable cover and a change in desert type from sandy to stony.

The fleet consisted of nine vessels, each of one hundred tons burden, with five hundred soldiers and sailors. After a long and tedious voyage, they arrived at the mouth of a river, near the present site of St. Augustine, Florida, on the 29th of August, 627. They found the river filled with fish, which they called _ciguas_ from its resemblance to a snake. It was a beautiful country and well watered, but the inhabitants were hostile. A large\",\"Performance analysis of a 10 MWp utility scale grid-connected canal-top photovoltaic power plant under Indian climatic conditions\\nR. Venkataraman, S. Mohanraj, A. J.

This paper presents a conceptual framework to examine the Indian climate research landscape and analyses the gaps and challenges. The analysis suggests that the climate-related research in the public domain is primarily conducted by governmental agencies and academic institutions. While some of the agency-led research is policy relevant, it is not systematic or integrated. There is no clear-cut division between research conducted in South and North India, but the latter has a stronger focus on adaptation and local-level miti-gation. Research on mit-igating and adapting to climate impacts is often conducted with a sector-specific perspective, and there\",\"Realism of the Indian Ocean dipole in CMIP5 models: The implications for climate projections\\nThe Indian monsoon is one of few natural systems that can be reliably predicted on a seasonal timescale. The Indian ocean dipoles (IODs), which are characterized by the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the equatorial Indian and Pacific oceans, have been shown to be associated with Indian summer mon-soons. However, the relationship between IOD and Indian Summer Monsoonal (ISM) rainfall is not yet well understood.

Groundwater\",\"Climate model simulation of the South Indian Ocean Convergence Zone: Mean state and variability\\nK. S. Goswami\\nClimate model simulations of SICZ are performed using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model. The model is driven by the observed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies from 1982 to 2001. A 30-year mean state is obtained for the SST, winds, and currents in the model domain. It is found that the mean SSI is maximum in summer and minimum in winter, with the maximum SSSI occurring in May and the minimum occurrings in August. In the annual mean, the current is cyclonic, except in some regions. These results are compared with observations.\\nThe annual cycle of variabilities in SAT, SSE, SW, SSW, current, surface pressure, etc., are also studied. Results show that SAV\",\"Decline and poleward shift in Indian summer monsoon synoptic activity in a warming climate\\nThe Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) are a key feature of the South Asian summer climate, providing the majority of rainfall to the region. In recent years, the ISM has become more active, with an increased number of extreme rainy days and more frequent heavy rains. These changes are likely related to a shift to more moisture-rich atmospheric circulation patterns. However, it remains unclear whether the observed changes in ISMA are linked to changes of ISMC. Here we show that the frequency of synopses with ISMS-like features has declined over the last 60 years. The polewards shift of these synopse is associated with a weakening of an atmosphric circulatry pattern, which has a large impact on the Indian monnsoonal rainstorms.\\nTitolo: Declining and Poleward Shift in the Frequency of Indian Sum\",\"Air pollution, climate change, and human health in Indian cities: a brief review\\nInt J Environ Res Public Health. 2013 Dec;10(12):6657-72. doi: 11.3390\\u002fijerph1 06 6421\\nSudhir Kumar 5, Nidhi Gupta 3, Purnima Singh 4, Ajay Singh\\n1 Department of Environmental Studies, University of Delhi, Delh i-1, India.\\n2 Department Of Environment Science, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, 9, INDIA.

India, a developing country, is facing a number of problems due to climate-related issues. In order to understand the role of the media in climate communication, this paper explores the coverage of this issue in the print news media of India. The study is based on a content analysis of a sample of 144 news reports published in 40 Indian newspapers. A coding scheme was developed to analyse the discursive patterns in news coverage. This study found that the majority of news articles were published during the year 2015 and the most common source of information was the government. Most of these articles focused on the impact of extreme weather events on human life, while only a few articles discussed the issue from an ecological perspective. There was a lack of scientific information in these news stories, which may have contributed to the spread of\",\"The influence of the Indian Ocean dipole on atmospheric circulation and climate over the Horn of Africa\\nThe Indian-Ocean dipoles (IOD) are large-scale coupled ocean-atmosphere oscillations that occur over tropical Indian ocean. They are known to have a significant impact on the climate of East Africa and the region is prone to frequent droughts and floods associated with the IOD events. This study investigates the impact of IODI on climate and atmos-pherics circulations over Horn-of-Africa (HOA) and East- Africa. The analysis is based on monthly averaged sea-level pressure (SLP) fields and month-to-month changes in SLP anomalies for the period 1980-2010. IODi events are identified using the SST anomaly of 0\\u00b0C as a threshold value. Results show that IODis have significant influence on SPL anom-alyses over HOA.

The monopole mode is the dominant mode in its variabilities. In this study, we have found that the mono-pole mode dominates the variabilty of Indian summer mon-soonal rainfall (ISMR) over the past 200 years. However, the equator-ward propagation of ISMR vari-ability is weak during the period of 0-30\\u00b0N in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hem-sphere.

To understand how climate and land use change will affect water availabilities in this region, we developed a hydrological model for the Kaveri River basin in south India, which is the largest basins in southern India. We used the model to simulate the effects of climate, land cover and population change.\\nThe model was calibrated using a 20-year simulation, and then used to project the hydrologic impact of a range of plausible future land and water use scenarios. In the future, the climate is likely to become warmer and drier, but the exact nature of this change is uncertain. Using the uncertainty in climate projections, it was possible to assess the range and likelihood of hydro-climatic conditions that might be expected in future.\",\"Post-tsunami engineering forensics: Tsunami impact on infrastructure\\u2014Lessons from 2004 Indian Ocean, 2010 Chile, and 2011 Tohoku Japan tsunami field surveys\\nP.

Joshi\\nClimate change adaptation is a challenge for developing countries like India. A study of farmer's knowledge and adaptation behaviour was undertaken in four villages in Rajasthan, India to understand the role of knowledge in adaptation. The study found that the farming communities in the villages were generally knowledgeable about climate and climate variability. They had good knowledge of weather and rainfall and also knew about the effects of climate on their crops and livestock. However, they lacked knowledge about how climate affects their livelihoods and how it affect their decision making.

The study is carried out using a calibration model of EnergyPlus, which is validated with measured data. A cooling load simulation is performed with the model and the results are compared with those of non-cool roof case. It is found that the cooler roof reduces the air-conditioning energy consumption by 13.5%. The energy reduction is more significant in summer season.\\nAuthor(s): S.S. Rao, Saji Kumar, P.P.

Climate change as challenge and opportunity for diplomacy and development.\\nClimate change is a pressing global challenge. India is one of the countries most affected by climate change. It is also a country that has been active in the international climate regime and has an increasingly important role in international negotiations. This paper analyses the development of Indian climate policy, focusing on the role of diplomatic and economic instruments and the influence of domestic and international actors. The paper argues that India has gradually moved from a position of scepticism to a more active and cooperative role. However, the country's position is still strongly influenced by its domestic development and climate policies. In the future, India will be an important actor in climate negotiatios, but its role will depend on how the domestic policies and diplomats are able to balance the interests of its different actors and how it can successfully combine economic development with climate mitigation.\",\"The political economy of urban climate adaptation and development planning in Surat, India\\nMohamed, M.S.

The use of agricultural residues, which are otherwise considered as waste, for the production of ethanols is not economically viable due to the high cost of production and the low price of petroleum-based fuels. In this context, the Government of India, in 2009, announced the National Policy on Biofuelfor the promotion of second generation bio-ethylol.\\nThe policy has aimed at promoting the use and productionof bio ethylols\",\"A study of climate and weather variability over the tropical southwest Indian Ocean using a coupled model\\nA study was conducted to investigate the variabilities of tropical Southwest (SW) Indian ocean climate using an atmospheric couple model. The model is a 40-year simulation of the global climate system, with 300 km grid resolution and 60 vertical levels. It is couple to an ocean model with a horizontal resolution of 150km. This study investigates the climate variablities of SW Indian oceans. In particular, the role of Indian monsoon and the oceanic processes in the SWIO region are investigated. A number of climatological features were examined, including the annual cycle of surface air temperature and precipitation, as well as the interannual variabilites of sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure and rainfall.\\nAuthor: Liu, Jing, Xie, Shuyi, Zhang, Rong\",\"Climatic clusters of the Indian region\\nThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has identified six major climatic zones in the country, viz. tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, semi-arid and arid.

The sector contributes about 17% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 45% of total employment in the country. India is a food-deficit country and is dependent on imports for meeting its food requirements. However, in recent years, India has been able to meet its own food requirement. This achievement has come about due to a number of factors including the Green Revolution, the introduction of new crops, and improved farming practices.\\nHowever, with climate change, it is expected that the agriculturally productive areas of India will be shifted towards the north and east. Thus, there will likely be a decrease in agriculturable land in western and southern India. As a result, agriculturer productivty is likely to decline in these regions. In addition, rainfall is also likely t o decrease, which will further impact agriculturre\",\"Soil organic carbon storage changes with climate change, landform and land use conditions in Garhwal hills of the Indian Himalayan mountains\\nSoil carbon (C) is an important component of soil organisms, and is the most important C pool in terrestrial ecosystems.

Climatic changes are expected to affect agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, the extent and magnitude of these changes remain uncertain. The uncertainty is due to the complexity of the problem and its inter-disciplinary nature. A review of literature on the impact of climatic change on agriculturally important crops shows that a wide range of studies have been undertaken. These studies are based on various modeling approaches, which include statistical and mechanistic models. There is a need for a more coordinated approach to study the effects of global climate changes on Indian cropping systems, especially for croplands under rainfed conditions. This is because, in rainy regions, rains are the primary source of water for crop growth, and changes in the\",\"Mitigating climate change impact on soybean productivity in India: a simulation study\\nThe socioeconomic and environmental impact of climate variability on agriculture has been the focus of several studies.

This study investigates the representation of IWW in coupled atmosphere-ocean models. The results show that the IWM is well represented in models with both ocean and atmosphere components. However, the model results indicate that most models have problems in reproducing the strength of Walker convection. In models where the Walker cell is represented well, precipitable water (PW) anomalies are generally associated with the position of convec-tive activity in a given model. For the couple models, PW anomaly patterns are related to the location of low-level convergence in their model, which is associated to anomalous Walker-cell con-vective intensity.

We use the Hurst exponent, which is a measure of long range dependence, to quantify the nonlinearity of these time-series. The Hurts exponent is related to the fd-dimension of a time serie, and we find that the monitory time scale and that of climatoligical time scales have fracional dimensions of 0.89 and 2.02, respectively.\\nTitolo: Fracal analysis and monnetary time\\nG.

The EOS EOF1 signal was found to be the strongest in all CMIP models, followed by the Eos1-Eos2 and Eps1. Epo1 was the dominant EO signal in CESM1 and CNRM-CM5, while Eso2 was dominant in GFDL-AM3 and GISS-EM2.1, and the weakest Eo signal appeared in ESM1M. In the tropics, the annual cycle of ETS was evident in most CPS models. This is consistent with previous studies, which showed that ET is the most dominant signal among all EI signals in a wide range of CMS models over the equatorial\",\"Four climate change scenarios for the Indian summer monsoon by the regional climate model COSMO\\u2010CLM\\nFour climate scenarios of the future Indian mon-soonal rainfall distribution are presented based on the coupled regional atmospheric\\u2010oceanic model (COSMO-CL) for 2050 and 55 years later, 100 years from now. The model simulations are forced by global warming and two different global scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8. 6). The results show that the mono-soual rains will be less intense over the entire region in the year 3015, but the seasonal cycle will not change significantly. For the high-emission scenario RPC8,6, the summer rainy season will shift to the north and to a lesser extent to south.

This paper assesses the impact of these programs on farmers' adaptation strategies and their well-being. The analysis relies on a large-scale survey of farming households in India conducted in 2010 and 11. It finds that climate risk has increased in recent decades, especially in the rainfed areas of India. We find that farmer adaptations to this risk have been successful in reducing the adverse impacts of climate variability. However, we also find evidence of increasing climate-related uncertainty. Farmers' uncertainty has been increasing in part because of the changing nature of rains, which has led to increasing uncertainty about the timing and amount of monsoon rainstorms, as well as the amount and distribution of pre-monsoonal and\",\"Carbonate preservation and rates of climatic change: an 800 kyr record from the Indian Ocean\\nNicholas J.

It takes a narrative approach to analyze the politics of climate policy in India. In particular, the paper aims to understand how the narratives of the climate crisis and the need for a low-carbon economy are used to advance different policy agendas. The paper develops the notion of a policy narration, which is a storyline about a specific policy issue that is told to a particular audience in order to persuade them to support a certain policy. These narrations are then used by policy actors to legitimize their policy claims. By examining the use of these narrational tools, this paper illustrates how policy stories can be used strategically to create new policy spaces.\\nDive into the research topics of 'Policy storylmes in Indan climate politic: Opening new politcal spaces'.

In this study, we explored the diversities of the adaptation responses of women and men farming households to the impacts of climate variability and change in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with 10 women farmer-households and 9 men. Our results revealed that women are more vulnerable than men to climatic risks and their responses are gender-specific. Women farmed on a smaller scale, were more dependent on rainfall, and were less aware of weather forecasts and climate information. They also had less access to technology and finance. Their coping strategic choices were mainly in terms of crop diversification and cash crops, which were found to\",\"Climate change adaptation in Indian Country: Tribal regulation of reservation lands and natural resources\\nThe authors present the results of a case study of tribal adaptation strategies in the Pacific Northwest, which provides a unique perspective on the ways in which tribally-run governments are addressing climate change impacts.\\nAuthor or Affiliated User: Shannon Osaka\\nClimate change and the energy sector: the need for a new approach to risk management\\nThis article discusses the potential impact of climate risks on energy companies.

The present study is aimed at investigating the impact of anthropogenic forcing on Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) using the outputs of 20th century climate model simulations from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 05). The results of the study show that the models are able to simulate the ISM variabilities and the modelled ISMS drifts are in agreement with the observed ISMM drift. However, the simulated ISMP drifting is not in accordance with that of ISMA drifters. Further, it is found that ISMD variabil-ity is more sensitive to the anthro-pogenically induced forcing as compared to ISMC vari-ability and this is in line with findings of earlier studies\",\"Media attention for climate change around the world: A comparative analysis of newspaper coverage in 27 countries\\nRebecca Slayton, Aaron McCright\\nClimate change is arguably the most pressing environmental issue of the twenty-first century. This article compares newspaper reporting of climate issues in twenty seven countries over a six-year period. It focuses on the extent to which the media frame climate as a social problem and the level of attention given to climate stories. The results show that the framing of global warming as an issue is highly variable across countries, and that countries with high levels of framed attention also tend to have high rates of actual attention. However, the findings also indicate that frames do not always predict the attention that climate receives in the news. We find that there is no consistent relationship between the degree of media framings and attention to the issue. Countries that frame global climate war as social issue are not necessarily more likely to report on it. Instead, media attention is determined by a combination of\",\"Evaluation of cooling potential of passive strategies using bioclimatic approach for different Indian climatic zones\\nNidhi Chandel1,\\nSantosh Kumar Sharma1 \u0026\\nAjay K Chaudhary1\\nIn this study, cool roofs, vegetation and wind catchers were selected as passively cool strategic building components.

However, there is little empirical evidence to support this claim. This paper examines the migration decisions of households in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The data come from a survey of 147 households from three villages, with a focus on the impact of climate on migration. A multinomial logistic regression analysis is conducted to identify the factors that affect migration to different places. It is found that households are more likely to migrate to the urban areas of the state. Migrants are found to be better off than non-migrants in terms of income and assets. Further, it was found from the regression results that the main drivers of migration are income, age, caste and gender.\\nHouseholds in Rajathan\\nDive into the research topics of\",\"Dynamic forest vegetation models for predicting impacts of climate change on forests: An Indian perspective\\nD.P.

Bruskotter, University of California, Irvine\\nThe global climate change regime is notoriously unequal in terms of the responsibilities it assigns to different countries. As a result, the climate regime has been criticized for being too weak to solve the problem it seeks to address. This paper argues that the Indian state's emergent climate policy reflects the inequalities of this regime, but that it also creates the conditions for a more equal regime in the future. India' s climate policies have been shaped by the country'''s weak capacity, its limited bargaining power, and the lack of international support for its interests. In response, India has pursued a strategy of 'opportunistic compliance' with the regime. The paper shows that this strategy has had mixed results.

The impact of this change can be seen in the form of erratic rainfall, rise in sea level, change in seasonal pattern, increase in temperature, etc. These changes have a negative impact on agricultural production in terms of reduced crop yield, higher cash and food grain price, increased incidence of pests and diseases, and so on.\\nThis has led to an increase of 22% in food inflation in 1998-9 and 38% increase during 97-8. In 70% of the districts in North India, wheat and rice production has decreased due to climate changes. This has resulted in an increased dependence on imported food. It has also led farmers to switch to non-food crops.

In this study, the role of the atmos-pheres in warping the global ocean temperature field is investigated. The Indian ocean is simulated in three general circulation models (GCMs) with a variety of ocean and atmosphere configurations. All models show an increase in tropical ocean heat content, and the magnitude of this war-ming is related to the strength of zonal winds over the ocean. Two of these models, with atmosph-eres that are dynamically coupled with the ocea-n, show a significant increase of sea surface temperature (SST) in both the Pacific and Indian O-cean.

McBride\\nSouth Indian ocean climate is strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and the ENSO cycle. These two modes of variabilty are linked, with EOF analysis of SAM indices suggesting a relationship between SST anomalies in the Southwest Pacific and Indian Oceans. The SASMOD model is used to explore the relationship and to investigate the mechanics of this linkage. A simple model of tropical SOMC is constructed, which captures the dominant features of observed SOSC. This model uses a combination of linear and non-linear mechanisims to explain the observed relationship. It is shown that the model can reproduce the SAT anomaly pattern, and that ERA40 data are consistent with the linear model.

Design\\u002fmethodology\\u002fapproach \\u2013 This paper assesses the effects of temperature and precipitation on the major crops of India: rice, wheat, maize, soybean, sugarcane, cotton, and pearl millet. The study is based on a panel data of 29 years (1980-2008). Findings \\u2013 Increase in temperature leads to a decline in rice production, whereas increase in precipitations leads a rise in the production of wheats and maizes. In case of soya bean, there is a positive impact on production. However, the effect of change in climate is not significant for sugar cane and cotten.

The present study is an attempt to develop a safety attitude scale to assess safety-related attitudinal constructs among officers of Indian ships. A scale consisting of 28 items was developed after conducting a literature survey and a pilot study. Data were collected from 156 officers from Indian vessels and analysed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analaysis. Factor analysis revealed that the scale consists of three factors namely safety precautions, safety rules and safety measures. Convergent validity was established using a set of safety related variables. Further, a good correlation was found between safety rule scores and accident rates. Internal consistency of the scales was also found to be high. It is concluded that\",\"indian defence minister's visit to china: new beginnings or continuity?\\nThe Indian defence Minister\\u2019s recent visit China is a significant milestone in the bilateral relationship.

It is not a defence policy for India, but a study of the problems that are involved in the formulation of a policy. The problems are many, and the solutions are not easy to find. This is the first book on defence to be written by an Indian. There have been many books on the subject written in English by British and American authors, by Indians who have worked in defence establishments and by foreigners who are experts on Indian defence. But there has been no book written from the Indian point of view. A book of this kind is needed. In this book, I have tried to discuss the defence problems of India from an independent point-of-view. I am aware that I may be criticised for being too critical of our defence establishment. My criticism is based on a close study and understanding of defence matters, which I believe to have acquired during the\",\"themes in british policy towards afghanistan in its relation to indian frontier defence, 1798\\u20131947\\nby B.

Introduction The defence industry is a key sector for the economic growth of any country. In the context of India, the country\\u2019s defence industrial base has been characterised by a combination of imports and indigenous production. While the former has ensured the availability of a wide range of defence equipment to the Armed Forces, it has also led to a high dependence on imports. Moreover, a large part of these imports are from a limited number of countries, which in turn has resulted in a vulnerable supply chain.\\nThe defence policy of 2013 has, therefore, sought to promote indigeneous design, development and manufacturing of equipment by the private sector. The policy also encourages foreign collaboration and technology transfers for defence production, subject to certain conditions. This has led the Government to consider relaxing the existing FDI policy in defence. Recent policy announcements have, however, been met with criticism from\",\"growing india-south korea strategic synergy: the defence domain\\nIndia and South Korea have been strategically synergising their efforts since the last two decades.

The development of nuclear capability by China has been a major factor in determining India' s strategies and policies. It is not merely a matter of concern for the defence of India but also for its foreign policy. In the light of this, the author has attempted to analyse the various aspects of Chinese nuclear programme and the implications for India. He has also tried to draw some lessons from the past and suggest some strategically viable options for dealing with China.\",\"foreign military aid and the defence strength and policies of india and pakistan: a comparative study\\nSaira Ijaz\\nThis study is an attempt to evaluate the foreign aid received by Pakistan and India and their military strengths and defence policies. It also tries to compare the military assistance and military capabilities of the two countries. The study uses a quantitative approach and relies on secondary data.\\nThe study finds that India is the largest recipient of military equipment from the United States. India receives 40 per cent of all military sales from America. Pakistan is ranked second with 14 per cents of total military imports from USA. On the other hand, India\\u2019s military expenditure is 3.6 percents higher than that of Pakistan. Furthermore, the study reveals that Pakistan has a higher military-to-GDP ratio than India. This implies that the Pakistani military is more powerful than the Indian military. Moreover, it also shows that both countries have a similar approach towards\",\"india's defence policy in the 21 st century\\na strategy for indian defence\\nIn 1998, India became the only country to have conducted a nuclear test. Since then, the country has been under a lot of international pressure to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). In the past, there have been many attempts to persuade India to join the treaty, but to no avail.\\nIndia has always been reluctant to do so, and for good reason. The CTBT is a flawed treat. It does not provide for the verification of nuclear tests. This means that India would be able to conduct nuclear weapons tests without any international oversight. Additionally, it does nothing to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. India is not the first country that has refused to ratify the CBTT.

In recent years, the defence ties between the two nations have grown stronger. This is reflected in joint military exerises and training programmes.

The Indian Armed Forces is one of the biggest employers in Indian defence sector. According to a report by the World Bank, India has one the lowest military expenditures in Asia. This is because the government has been unable to meet its budgetary requirements and has had to rely on foreign loans to fund its military.

The programme, which has been in existence since the early 1980s, was officially announced in January 2003. Since then, there has emerged a plethora of reports in both the Indian and international media on the programme. There are also a number of studies and articles on BMD published in academic journals. Most of these studies are either purely technical in nature or focus on one aspect of the BDM programme without providing a comprehensive picture of its political and strategic implication. This study, therefore, attempts to fill this gap in knowledge by examining the political factors that have influenced the development of BM D in India.

China has been the largest foreign direct investor in this region since 2004, while India'S investors have been more selective and have not been able to catch up with China. The main difference between the two countries is the use of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as the vehicle for their foreign operations. This paper argues that the SOE-based investing strategy of China is a major reason for its success in attracting foreign energy investm ent in its peripheral region. It is also argued that India, with its private sector-led invest m ent strategy, is less likely to be successful in capturing a large share of foreign inves m en t in infrastruc tures.\\nDive into the research topics\",\"Decentralised urban governance in India: implications for financing of urban infrastructure\\nThe study examines the institutional structure of decentralisation in urban India and its implication for the finan...\\nLocal Governance and Decision-Making in the Urban Environment\\nThis paper explores the impetus behind decentrally-oriented urban development, and the potential challenges in a...\",\"The work of waste: inside India's infra\\u2010economy\\nAuthor: Lal, Ashish\\nJournal: The Journal of Peasant Studies\\nSubjects: Waste management\\nAbstract: 'Waste' is a key term in the literature on globalisation and development. It is often used to describe the 'wasteful' production of the global North, and the inefficiency of its recycling. In contrast, the waste of global South is seen as a valuable resource. This article argues that these opposing views of 'global waste' are both wrong. Rather than being a problem to be solved, waste is central to the functioning of contemporary capitalism. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Delhi, it shows that waste management is not just a technical problem of recycle, reuse or dispose, but a political one of how wastefulness is defined.

The private sector is an important source of finances for infrastruture, but it has been reluctant to invest in projects with high risks and low returns. This paper examines the possibility of using public private partnership (PPP) to attract private financse. It reviews the literature on PPPs and concludes that they can be an effective way of financing infrastrucutre projects in developing countrie. PPPS can help reduce the risky of investment in infrastrcture, and they may also help to reduce transaction costs. However, PPCs are not without their problems. They can lead to corruption and can also be expensive.\\nKeywords: infrastrcutre, public sector, private secto, partnershi, finace\\nJEL:\",\"Promoting low carbon transport in India: NMT Infrastructure in India: Investment, policy and design\\nJuly 2013 - The Indian government has made a commitment to promote non-motorised transport (NMT) in cities and towns.

The country is facing an infrastrucutre deficit of over $1 trillion.\\nThe Indian government is trying to address this issue by allocating over 30% of its budget to infrastruture development. However, this is not enough. In order to bridge the infrastrucre defict, India needs to invest more than $500 billion in infrastrcture over the next five years. This is where foreign exchnage resrves come in. Foreign exchange reerves can be used to fund infrastrure projects in India. There are a number of benefits to using foreign echange resves to fince infrastrcure. First, it will help to boost economic growth. Second, foreign currency reses will be able to help finace infrastrutcures that are not financed by the government.

The study was conducted in RajKot city in India, where the urban infrastru-ture is not adequate and the land is very expensive. A geographically weight-ed least squares model was used to estimate the effects of access to water, sewerage, electricity and road facilities on the values of the plots. In this model, the weights of plots were calculated based on their access distance to the infrastruc- ture facilities. It was found that the access distances of water and sewage infrastruture facilities to resident plots have a significant positive effect on resident plot values.\\nK. V. Ramana\\nRajkumar P.

However, the PPP model has been found to be ineffective in the case of developing countries due to lack of capacity, political and bureaucratic interference, and poor project management. The public-private-partnership (P3) model is considered to overcome the problems of PP model. In India, a number of infrastruc-ture projects have been developed through P3.

At the same time, infrastructure investment can have significant positive effects on productive capacity and human development. In this paper, we review the empirical literature on the effects of infrastructures and services on economic growth and income distribution. We find that, in principle, the literature provides strong support for the view that public investments in infrastruture can raise growth. However, empirically the results are less clear. The main obstacle to stronger growth effects is that the quality of public infrastrcture and public service provision is often poor.

Complex arrangements of actors, infrastructure, and practices in everyday water provisioning in a small town in India\\nCo-authored with: Nina P.

We argue that the ways in which water flows through the town are not only a result of the physical infrastructures, but also of every-day practices. These practices are negotiated through interactions among the actors in different social and institutional spaces. Drawing on ethnographic material, we identify three different practices through which households access water: (1) a practice of self-reliance; (2) the practice to obtain water from a neighbour; and (3) buying water at a water kiosk.\",\"Financing road infrastructure in China and India: current trends and future options\\nA new report by the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP) and the China Centre for International Economic Exchanges (CCIEE) explores the current financing of road projects in India and China, and offers recommendations for the future.\\nThe report, Finance and Infrastructure: China-India Comparative Study, examines the funding sources for roads in both countries, the challenges and opportunities for financially sustainable road investment, as well as the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs).\\nBoth China (30.8%) and Indian (21.4%) governments fund the majority of their road construction and maintenance.

Investment decisions in public infrastrruction are influenced by private and public actors. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of public and private investment for primary education in India. Using a panel data set of 14,895 villages from 2001 to 305, the study employs a two-step approach to analyse the impact of investments in infrastrucutre on primary enrolment. First, we analyise the determinants of primary infrastrcuture investement in the villages.

The China-led Asian infrastructure investment bank (AIIB), which was established in December 2015, is the newest multilateral development bank. Its main goal is to provide infrastructural development financing in Asia. In this paper, I argue that the AII Bank is an institutionalized version of the Chinese revisionism and a new form of Chinese power projection. It is a status seeking institution, which is meant to give China more influence in global economic governance.\\nhttps:\\u002f\\u002fdoi.org\\u002f10.1177\\u002f095712216X1461365307524\\n18051_1-s2.0\",\"Estimation of the potential changes in the social impacts of transitioning to circular economy for multiple stakeholders\\u2014a case of Indian transportation infrastructure\\nThe transport sector is one of those industries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

It is found that the Indian road system is characterized by poor network density. However, the network is not well connected. This is because of low road connectivity, which is a result of poor road design and low level of maintenance. Moreover, high traffic volume and poor traffic management are responsible for the high level road accident rate. In order to improve the overall performance, it is necessary to increase the level and quality of investment in road maintenance and safety, and to develop a systematic and comprehensive planning and design of roads.\",\"Eye care infrastructure and human resources for managing diabetic retinopathy in India: The India 11-city 9-state study\\nRavindra N.

This study examines the relationship between transport expansions and the country's ecopolitical performance in terms of ecology. The analysis is based on a panel data set of 20 Indian states for the period 1991-2102. A two-stage least squares (2SLS) method is used to estimate the long-run impact on India' s ef foot print. It is found that transport investments in roads and railways increase the state' e foot prints, while the invest- ments in airports reduce the states' foot- prints. Moreover, the results indicate that the growth rate of road and railway expan- sions in a state is negatively related to the level of per\",\"Quality infrastructure of India and its importance for inclusive national growth\\nIndia is the second most populous country in the world with a population of over 1.3 billion people.

The manufacture of automobiles, which is the mainstay of Indian transportation, is also one the largest energy consumers, with a share of about one-third of India's total industrial energy use. A large proportion of this energy is consumed in the form of crude oil, mainly imported from the Middle East. India is thus exposed to the volatility of international oil prices and vulnerable to supply disruptions.

However, little is known about how the provision of these services affects inequality in developing countries. This paper addresses this gap by estimating the impact on income inequality of the introduction of a large-scale infrastruture program in rural India. The results show that the program had a significant impact in reducing income and asset inequality, but the effect was not permanent.

However, there is a lack of research on the relative performance of private and government schools. This paper assesses the performance and costs of government and private schools, and compares the physical conditions of these schools with those of the public schools of similar economic status. The analysis is based on a sample of 2,217 schools from the 64th round of India's National Sample Survey. We find that private-sector schools are generally better equipped than government-run schools and are more likely to be located in urban areas. On average, government primary school teachers are less educated than their private counterparts. Private schools also tend to have higher teacher-student ratios, which may be explained by the fact that government school students are not required to pay fees\",\"Do infrastructure and quality of governance matter for manufacturing productivity?

In India, the share of urban population living in informal settlements has increased from 33% in 1991 to 45% of total urban residents in the 2001 census. The Government of India has recognized the need for slum upgradation and has launched several schemes to address the problems of inadequacy of services and insecurity of tenure in urban areas. However, there is little evidence on the extent to which these schemes have been effective in improving the quality of life in these areas and the incentives for households to move to these slummy areas or to upgrade their living conditions.
