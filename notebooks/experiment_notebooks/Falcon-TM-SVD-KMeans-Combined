We have used panel cointegration technique to find long-term relationship between two variables. This study finds a positive long term relationship, which indicates there is a cointegrating relationship exist between Government Size Index and GDP for the study period. Our results imply that Government expenditure is an important component of the economy and it is positively associated with the economic development of a country in the sense that the expenditure helps the development process. The results of Granger-Causality tests also support the long run and short run causal relationships.

Our model is estimated for two decades, 1951-80 and 1981 - 99 using annual data for a panel of 15 states in India. The results show that the share of growth in the capital-natural resource-labor input product (K) is 0.7% of GDP, while the labor-capital product is equal to 4.0% and total product to about 3.4%, implying that growth was mostly driven by capital and not labor.

In the present research, we have studied and analyzed the effect of oil price volatility shocks and oil-exporting-country shocks in a dynamic setting using the Markov regression models. Our findings indicate that the oil exporters have been experiencing the volatility in oil prices as compared to that of exporters of other major commodities. The oil export economy is more vulnerable to shocks of commodity prices. We have also found that shocks to the prices of non-oil exporting countries, especially the ones with high per capita income, are significantly higher than that to oil exporting ones. Thus, the policy makers should focus more on the non oil sector.\\n- Khandelwal, Vivek & Sharma, Sanjeev, 2013. \\\"Oil shocks, oil exports and macroeconomic performance of OPEC and non OPET exporters: A panel\",\"private defence under indian criminal law and the law of torts 3 volumes 1st Edition pdf.\",\"operationalising taylor-type rules for the indian economy: issues and some results (1992q3 2001q4)\\nAbstractThis paper presents the results of an econometric study of the Taylor type rules in an emerging economy like India.

The process of industrialisation in the Indian economy has its own special features, which are different from what is happening in most of the Western countries.

Data was gathered through questionnaire from 100 personnel in three different grades from an Indian company. Results indicate that job dissatisfaction is related negatively with organizational commitment and satisfaction. Organizational commitment was found to be an important mediator between occupational stressors and job stress. Occupational stressors are significantly related with job anxiety. It is found that the level of job demand, control and social support are found as the major sources of stress at workplace.

The study is motivated by the fact that India has the highest growth of per-capita energy consumtion, and is among the fastest growing economies with a per capital energy usage that was 0.2 percent of global energy demand in 2011. A long-run relationship is estimated with co-integration technique.

Explain this view'\\nAns:\\nThe Indian economy has been in the process of a gradual transition from a planned to a market economy - a shift from command to competition. This is the most significant and important change that has transformed the economy in a post-independence period. The process is gradual as the Indian state is still the dominant force in determining the direction of the economic policy, and the state remains the major employer in both the public and private sector. As the transition takes place the market and state continue to operate in parallel, but with increasing convergence. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between the two and also to appreciate the differences between them as this will help in understanding their respective roles and functions..

The objective behind the decision to demonitize notes of Rs. 500 and Rs 1000 was to curb the practice of Black Money.\\nThe decision of demonisation was taken after long discussions and deliberations in the parliament. In fact the idea of bringing black economy into the tax net was a vision of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had spoken about it even before his election and has been working for its successful implementation since his first tenure. But the implementation of this vision had become a matter of great debate. There were strong voices opposing it as it would affect the daily transactions of people.

The Indian financial market has evolved from the 1960s to today. Financial market liberalization in the form of foreign equity participation, and the creation of a secondary market through the introduction of trading system on exchanges have been a significant part of this process. A VAR model is estimated using monthly data for the period between 1980Q2 and 2007Q4. In addition, a VECM model with financial depth as proxy for financial intermediation has been used in order to assess the effects of financial deregulation on India's financial sector. Finally, the effect of de-regulation has also been assessed by the use of an ARMA model.

The authors find that the effects are highly concentrated: while there exist several policies which have had a positive effect on growth during the past three decades, others have clearly worked in the opposite direction. A large number of policies have been tried and discarded. The main policy conclusions are that, although the government's fiscal deficit did play an important role in promoting economic activity, its impact was limited. On the other hand, a well-targeted, pro-poor expenditure program can have a very significant impact, particularly when it complements private capital flows. This finding is especially important, since there is currently a tendency in many developing countries, especially in South Asia, to advocate a \\\"privatization\\\" of social and economic policy, as a means of\",\"the economic history of india, 1857-1947\\nR.N.

It is paid by consumers at the point of final consumption, and thus the burden does not fall entirely on producers. This makes it easier for the government to collect.\\nAs an effect, it reduces tax evasion, since tax collection is not based on physical delivery. Also, as it is levying on a product rather than a person, there are more chances of it being collected. However, the collection of GST is also dependent on how well the administration of tax works.

This has brought with it an influx of foreign direct investment. The industry is also growing as it becomes increasingly self-sufficient in the development of its own software products, and as more and more software companies set up operations in India. However, the Indian computer services industry still faces a number of challenges, including a lack of a formal education system and skilled labour, which is a critical issue that has led to the industry\\u2019 s inability to reach its full potential.\\nThere is an emerging need to look at the political-economy of this industry and its impact on the society as well as on other industries.

The results show that prices are not flexible in response to changes in relative prices but are flexible with respect to real variables. Price rigidities may explain the low responsiveness of the price levels to relative price changes. There is a negative long-term relationship between relative real wages and relative relative consumer prices. This suggests the existence of downward nominal rigidity. An explanation for this is provided on the basis of an investment function for real wage determination and the assumption that nominal wages are determined in terms of relative productivity.\\nDepartment\\nDescription\\ntext\",\"import intensity of exports: a case study of indian economy\\nDate2018-11-01\\nAuthor\\nPrasad, Suresh\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nIndia is an open economy which is dependent on exports as the share of imports in its GDP is 12.5% and 16.2% in the current and future year respectively. India\\u2019s share in world trade has been continuously increasing and is now at the 10th place after overtaking UK and Germany. It is interesting to note that Indian exports were only 1% of the world exports in 2000 which increased to 2.3% at current prices in year 2015. In spite of this growth there has not been enough attention given to the exports. The main aim of any economy is to improve the standard of living of its people and exports help in achieving that goal by creating employment opportunities and providing foreign exchange which can be used for import of capital goods.\",\"diversification, propping and monitoring: business groups, firm performance and the indian economic transition in the post-indeped\\nAbstractThe Indian economy has experienced dramatic economic transformation in recent years, moving from centrally controlled and regulated industries to a more market-based, competitive economy. This paper examines how firm behaviour and performance have changed during this period of rapid transition. Using data from the Business Group Survey Panel of the Reserve Bank of India, we find that firms belonging to the same group tend to be similar in terms of diversification, capital intensity and firm size. We find some evidence that the diversification behaviour of firms varies across the groups. The data also suggest that groups have responded to increased competition by increasing investment in capital goods and by diversifying into newer and more productive industries. However, despite these improvements in performance, many firms are not able to maintain their competitiveness.

A number of reasons account for this state of affairs. One, economic analyses of the Indian type, which could be used for the purpose of policy making, were not produced. There was a dearth of trained economists who could write on India. The other reason was the political economy of India which was in its formative stage. This meant that it had been the subject of much debate but had not yet crystallised as the science of economic development which it has since acquired. Finally, there has, in fact been an intellectual resistance to the study of economics in general and Indian economy in particular.\\nThe first reason\",\"American Indian students' perceptions of racial climate, multicultural support services, and ethnic fraud at a predominantly white university\\nAbstract\\nThe purpose of this descriptive correlational study was to describe the perceptions regarding multicultural services of American Indian college students at one public university in the Southwest United States.

Students also reported that they received support from staff and faculty in academic and non-academic areas.

The Indian economy is the seventh largest in the world in purchasing power parity terms. This paper presents the evolution and analysis of economic and population growth in India using data from Census of india, World Bank and National Sample Survey of Statistics. I have analysed the data on growth using Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the Granger Causality tests. For these tests, the variables selected as the dependent variable, namely the real GDP growth, are the most appropriate as they represent the performance of economy. India has made remarkable progress in economic, social and human development during this period.

Energy consumption also has a negative effect and a long run relationship on environment degradation. It is further observed that per capita energy use has an important impact on energy related pollution and environment. A reduction in energy per person leads to an increased environment related problem.

We find a negative relationship for all but two of the four periods. The negative coefficient suggests that women are not pushed out of labor by rising wages or rising employment opportunities for men, nor are they pulled out by increased educational opportunities. Rather than being pushed into a job by economic growth, women appear to be pulled in because they have the opportunity to work. This is consistent with the view that economic expansion in the developing world provides the opportunities women want.

Our main result is that the model predicts a reduction of total consumption and of the share of high price fuel for low income households. However, for high income groups the substitution reduces total fuel consumption but it increases the shares of both fuels. The model also shows that fuel switching can be beneficial if it is preceded by a price increase.

Today, with the use of mobile phones, internet and digital devices we have become a part and parcel of this technological revolution. With the advent of internet, digital media, social media and mobile communication, the world of marketing has seen a tremendous change and it is also a known truth that the digital world is the place where we are all connected.

The raw materials are drawn from the land and from other natural resources like forests, water sources and the like.\\nThis stage is also called as the primary stage because here the main concern of the people was to survive and there was very little attention to the growth and development of economic activity.

We argue that the recent increase of non-agricultural informally employed population should not be seen as a sign of worsening economic performance, as some recent studies suggest. Rather it should be interpreted in a context in which informal sector is increasingly seen to be a source for positive growth effects through the creation of new job opportunities, and its positive impact on growth in terms of productivity, income and inequality reduction is growing. Our results show that, although informal labour share is increasing in Indian economy, the positive effects on economic development of this employment growth still prevail.

The analysis suggests that growth is determined by long run factors, such as capital, labour, physical capital and total factor productivity. In the analysis, the authors have used the standard longrun relationship of Solow (1957) with a Cobb-Douglas production function. A long term growth model has been developed to capture the effect of longterm investment and growth. Convergence between the states is also tested with standard statistical tests.

The impact is likely to be greater than in developed countries due to several factors. First, the developing countries are in a process of rapid growth and have high savings rates and hence, a higher multiplier for capital. Second, capital account liberalization has been a major factor, making the emerging economy capital accounts more transparent and stable. Third, many of the countries that have received significant capital flows also have large domestic markets, which are relatively less affected by the influx of capital from abroad.\\nKeywords:\\nForeign Investment\\nDevelopment\\nGrowth\\nEconomy\\nIndia\\nGDP.

However, in 1972, the then PM of India, Mrs Indira Gandhi introduced a uniform national tax that brought together the state taxes into one national levy. The GST will also ensure the tax collection is uniform across all States and that the same rate is applied to each commodity. It will be the world\\u2019s largest tax reform since World War 2.

As a result, they can also help in reducing the unemployment level as it provides more employment opportunities to many. The government of India is also working on the policy of encouraging SMEs through various programs. It is believed that if the SMEs grow, then India will develop faster and more efficiently.

The results indicate that there is an unidirectional and negative relationship among crude, interest rates and real economic output. Also we have found that an increase in real interest leads to the growth of Inflation. Moreover, the results also confirm the fact that inflationary expectations play an important role in inflation and output growth, and the effect is stronger for inflation in India. Therefore, a decrease in the real rate of interest and a rise in oil prices are the two major factors behind inflation: 109-119\\nReferences listed on IDEAS\\nPlease report citation or reference errors to, or |.\",\"goods and services tax: a milestone in indian economy\\n- Author:\\nn\\u002fa\\n-.\",\"the indian economy in global context a textbook in macroeconomicsDownload Book The Indian Economy In Global Context A Textbook In Macroecomics in PDF format.

It argues that India's agriculture has been characterised by a \\u201cdual technological structure\\u201d - a combination of imported and indigenous technologies. In spite of significant state intervention in agriculture, this dual structure remained intact. The article traces the emergence of this structure and its consequences. A new model of agricultural development, based largely on imported technologies, was introduced from the early 1960s. However, the state continued to play a crucial role in the development of the agricultural extension system, which promoted the adoption of new technologies by small farmers. This model proved incapable of providing a sustainable development path, however, as it was based on an unsustainable pattern of production which relied heavily on external inputs. As a result, by the mid-1990, India had become highly vulnerable to international fluctuations in agricultural prices\",\"on prices and economic power: explaining recent changes in intersectoral relations in the indian economy by rajkumar singh. 3 \\u2022 a recent study of the effect of trade on the distribution of income has shown that the share of gdp generated by industry in india was 17 per cent in 1996 and 22.

The growth of industrial production and commercial activity, the expansion of foreign trade, and above all, agricultural transformation, are seen as fundamental in the process. This chapter will examine some issues involved in interpreting the nature and significance of these trends. These issues arise out of a consideration of their social context: the changing structure of society and of class relations, in particular. It will be argued that these transformations are best seen both as consequences and as agents of change in India, which in turn is best interpreted as an integral part of nineteenth and twentieth- century capitalism.\",\"Infrastructure development in India: post-liberalisation initiatives and challenges\\nAuthor:\\nKapferer, Fran\\u00e7ois\\nSeries: Working Paper - World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU\\u002fWIDER) No. 2005\\u002f70\\nPublisher: Helsinki, Finland: UNU \\u002f WID.\",\"in defence of the fragment: writing about hindu-muslim riots in india today, in a new collection of essays edited by prabhat mazumdar and rajesh kaul, the eminent scholar and journalist arundhati roy, writes, \\\"i was once told by a journalist that the hindus are not good at writing essays - they're not used to it..\\nEssay on my school in sanskrit language, research papers on database management systems pdf viewer essay on criticism pope epistle 1 zip dissertation proposal presentation structure essay outline template for college admission essay introduction about yourself zumba dissertation fellowships social sciences youtube essay writing.\\nA hindoo and a moslem, a hindoostanean and moslum are different races, different languages, and different religions, as different as a tigers cub and an englishman (p 2) he says the british government in 1927 has made a mistake when they gave the moslems the franchise\",\"Infrastructure: its development and impact on agriculture in north-east india\\nAuthor(s)Bhandary, Dinesh Chandra\\nOther Contributors\\nLeaders, innovators & change makers.\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThe study is a case study of the impact of infrastructure development on the growth of agriculture \\u002f food processing - related industries and rural economy in the North East (NE) region of India.

In order to achieve this objective, various data series such as GDP data, inflation data etc. were used. It has been observed from the time series of GDP that the economy has faced a negative shock to growth due to various reasons. However the effect due the negative shocks has not been significant. The analysis also showed that a rise in inflation has led to a reduction in economic activity in India. Thus in order not to face the impact of negative growth shocks and to increase the rate of growth in the near future, the government has to reduce the level of inflation in a sustainable manner.

Foreign capital investment in one's economy is called capital influx. If the economy of one particular country experiences capital outflow, it is said to be capital deflows. It means there is a capital movement of money from a high yielding economy to another economy with lower yielding potential. In other words, a flow of funds from one capital account to the other capital accounts. Capital inflations and outflows are the most important factor which affects a nation' s economic condition.

The per capita income rose by 2.7% per annum. But, the employment growth rate has been very slow, especially in recent years. In 1998-89, there was a decline in growth of per capital income as the GDP growth slowed down to less than 4%. At the same time, growth in employment slowed considerably and the unemployment rate rose from 7.2% in 1983-84 to 11.5% by March,1999. This is despite the fact that the labour force participation rate increased from around 35% to more than half during this period.

The panel data method estimates an aggregate production function for manufacturing. Our results show that investment has a significant effect on productivity for Indian manufacturing firms.

The analysis of this paper is based on the assumption that the access of rural households to banking and microfinance institutions can improve the living conditions of poor households by providing them with financial services. In particular this study aims to identify the impact of micro financing on income generation and poverty reduction of households. For this purpose, a regression model for the poverty status of a household is estimated. A two-stage least squares estimation procedure is used to test the hypothesis. Empirical results reveal that access and use of financial service by poor farmers has positive and significant impact on their income and on household poverty.

The estimates suggest that the rate of change in technical intensity of the Indian industry is 3.7 percent per annum, which implies that technical progress is being made at a relatively fast rate in Indian industries with the exception of textiles and food processing industries where technological improvement is slower.

However, the rapid growth of this industry has not benefited the labour force in terms of higher wages, better working conditions and job security. In fact, labour in India, as elsewhere in South Asia, remains relatively undervalued and under-employed. The current industrial and economic policies have been shaped by the dominant global market-oriented ideology. As a result, workers are often seen only in economic and political terms. This paper focuses on one of India`s most vulnerable sectors, namely, textiles and clothing, to demonstrate how the state has been unable to protect the interests of workers and ensure decent employment.\",\"india's political economy: the gradual revolution (1947-2004)\\n- Introduction\\nThis is about the history of political, economic, social, and cultural changes of India from the period of independence until recently. This is not about a history which is based on a linear development, rather a historical development which has changed in its structure, direction, or form of development.\\nIt is important to distinguish between the'slow process of change' in the political and economic sphere, as well as in other spheres, such as the social sphere. In the case of economic development in particular, the development has not always been linear. Sometimes there have been periods of stagnation and periods with rapid growth. For example, from 1980 until 1990 the Indian economy grew at an average of 5.5 percent. The average annual growth rate in 2007\\u002f2008 was 8.2 percent.

We find that, in the short term, there is a negative association between liberalization of economic activity and acquirers' and targets' returns on the day of the takeover announcement. However, this negative relationship is not sustained over time. Our findings suggest that the initial negative impact of liberalizing reforms on acquire 2006-02.\\nLength:Length is 28 pagesLength in Tabular form:\\nDate of creation: 01 Feb 2010\\nReferencesNo references listed on IDEAS\\nYou can help add them by filling out this form.\",\"the middle eastern question, or some political problems of indian defence. by valentine chirol.(london: murray, 1903.) this little book contains an account of recent political developments in the middle east and some reflections on the future, from the point of view of an englishman who had travelled extensively in that region and knew the people and the language. in its day this book was well-known, but it is now rather forgotten. it contains a lot of detail of the sort that might have interested me when i was younger, though i am not sure that the author's style is easy to read. but the book does include a list of arabic words and an index.\\nthe author also published some books of travel in africa, asia, and europe. i don't think i have read anything else by him.\",\"an analytical view of crude oil prices and its impact on indian economy\\n- Oil price hike has been the cause of the high increase in the price of commodities and the rising prices in India.

There are three broad scenarios that could materialize. The first scenario is the worst of them - a collapse of the government and a return to political chaos. This will be a disaster for the economy as it will mean a loss of credibility and confidence among foreign and domestic investors. A government collapse would also mean the end of all the reforms that have taken place in recent years and an immediate return of protectionism and cronyism. If this is avoided the second scenario, which is not as bad as the first one, may emerge. Under this scenario the current government may survive, but its ability to push through the needed structural reforms may be severely\",\"impact of fiscal policy shocks on the indian economy 1 introduction fiscal deficits and fiscal balances are two of the most important economic variables (the other.

This paper examines why this is so. We argue that two factors are most important: the rapid increase in India's stock of knowledge - the result of an educational investment programme that was begun in 1973 [1] and the adoption in that same year of a'market friendly' macro-economic policy. These two features have led to rapid growth of the manufacturing sector, and with this growth has come a rise in productivity and a substantial increase is labour skills. The second part of this paper discusses the implications of these developments for a race-relations theory of economic development. Our analysis of Indian data indicates that the increase of India in economic performance and labour productivity has taken place at the expense of labour and income shares of China. While this suggests that India is not on a similar path to East Asia, the data also indicate that,\",\"The investment climate in 16 Indian states has improved in a short period of time, but the country still requires long term structural reforms to boost the growth momentum and create more jobs.\\nA report by PwC, a global consultancy, said the overall investment sentiment in the states increased significantly during the first half of this year after the Modi government came to power in May.

However, the report noted that \\u201cthe investment momentum is still slow due to a range of factors like poor infrastructure in many states and a lack of skilled workers\\u201d.\\nThe report, which covered the investment sentiments of 18 states including the national capital, observed,.\",\"culture and institutions as public goods: american indian economic development as a problem of collective action\\nThis dissertation examines the problem that American Indian reservations experience, the collective nature of the challenge, and the role of American government institutions to address this challenge. American Indians experience a lower level of living than the non-Indian population. The reasons for this lower standard of life are not simple and can be attributed to a combination of factors such as low human capital, a lack of access to land and credit, limited economic diversification, as well as the legacy of Indian policy and culture. This work uses the theory of public choice to develop a model that explains how American reservations can experience low standard living and why this is the current situation.\\n- Kuk, Hyung-Joon (Author)\\n-.\",\"an interdiciplinary approach to american indian economic development: proceedings of a conference (2005)\\n- \\\"The 21st Century Challenge: Economic Development in Rural America,\\\" Proceedings of Rural Development Conference 2002, USDA, Economic Research Service, Washington, D.C..\\nOther Publications\",\"Do ethical climates impact trust in management?

Using a cointegrated VAR model, results from this study indicate that financial deepening in the economy has a significant positive impact on real GDP, which has improved over time.\\nThe results also indicate the existence of a long term relationship between real financial depth and real output in both the short term and long run. Further results indicate financial development to have had a positive effect in reducing the volatility of Indian output and to a small extent in curbing the variability of inflation. Financial depth has also had some influence in increasing the rate at which the real per capita income increased. This study also finds evidence of financial develoment in contributing positively to the reduction of unemployment. The results of this research also find some support for a '\",\"a study on demonetisation and its impact on indian economy\\nThe impact of the decision by the Government of India to demonitise high-value currency notes in November 2016 on Indian economy has been the subject of extensive discussions and analyses in the Indian media and academic circles. While there has not yet been sufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusion, a few facts and trends, based on publicly available data, suggest that the economic impact so far has largely been negative. In particular, there appears to be a sharp decline in bank deposits, and this is likely to translate into further contraction in credit to the private sector. These developments are also affecting the overall economic growth and the fiscal deficit of both the central government as well as state governments. Further, the recent decline, which was sharper than anticipated, in exports has also adversely affected foreign exchange reserves. The impact is further compounded by a rise in global oil prices. This has led to an increase in overall\",\"an index of coincident economic indicators for the indian economy - (pdf 3mb)\\nThe Reserve Bank of India [RBI], as the regulator of the Indian banking system & the custodian of monetary policy, provides the most comprehensive set of macroeconomic \\u2013 monetary and financial data \\u2018in a single window\\u2019 ().\\nThis dataset provides a measure of Indian \\u201ceconomic well being\\u2019 which comprises of 16 indicators of economic activity \\u002f performance covering different areas of activity such as Agriculture, Industry, Services, Trade, Prices, Consumption, Credit to Private Sector, Industrial Production, Inflation, Investment, Interest Rates, Exchange Rates etc.\\nData is available from 1984-87.

We find evidence of structural break in India's real trade balances in both the short-term and long-terms. A break appears to be associated with the introduction of economic reforms in 1991 and also with a rise in oil prices during the mid-1990s. These results imply that the sustainability hypothesis that has been used to argue for liberalization in other developing countries is not applicable to India. The results also suggest that trade liberalizations, such as the WTO negotiations, may have been delayed because of concerns about the long run sustainability (2008)\\n- New Economics Papers: this issue\\nMore about this item\\nKeywordspopulation; trade; unit roots; cointegration; structural Breaks;\\nStatisticsAccess\",\"india: economic development and social opportunity: chapter i: the political, social, and economic environment -- chapter ii: a country with a billion dreams - part 1 (part 2)\\nchapter ii. a nation with billion dreamers part one\\na nation of a \\u201cbillion dreamer\\u201d\\nIndia has 300 million people living under \\u2018poverty line.\\u2019 40% of the population is under the age of 25!\\nThe median age is only 24!

Using state-level data covering the pre-liberalization and post-liberization periods for major crops, the study examines whether the benefits of liberalizations in terms of higher growth and employment are being fully realized by different states or if they are concentrated in particular regions. We find that the growth of gross value added (GVA) per worker is significantly associated with agricultural reform measures, implying that agricultural growth is being stimulated by policy reforms; however, it is not uniform across states. This is corroborated by the results of the regression of GVA per farmer on agricultural reforms, which show that reforms have not significantly increased the productivity of farmers. The results are robust to the inclusion of state dummies in different regressions. In general, agricultural policies in India have been more liberalized in states with relatively higher levels of industrial\",\"Patterned pogroms: Patronage networks as infrastructure for electoral violence in India and Indonesia\\nThis paper studies the effects of patronage networks on electoral outcomes in two cases: India, where a \\u201cwinner takes all\\u201d electoral system allows the creation of a winner-take-all patronage structure that is highly conducive for the perpetration of electoral crimes; and in Indonesia which uses a multi-seat district system that makes such networks less effective.

This study explores the impact of two different types of ethics climate on the employee commitment and the effect of ethical practices on these climates. It also studies how these two dimensions of climates interact with job performance in the Indian bank sector. The results show that in an Indian context, an ethical culture with high levels of fairness and integrity is more beneficial than a culture that is less ethical, in terms of job and personal commitment. A strong ethical orientation also has an impact on organizational performance. Further, results indicate that the two types interact in different ways on commitment; fairness climate has a positive impact, whereas honesty climate is negatively impacted by ethical climates that are less honest. In sum, the findings indicate an interdependency between an organization\\u2019s ethical and ethical commitment climates on job satisfaction and performance outcomes, thereby supporting the argument that an employee\\u2019 willingness to remain with the organization is an outcome of both an individual\",\"does the indian economy support wagner  s law? an econometric analysis\\ndo you have the same view? do you think the Indian economy is a good candidate for wlg law as per the model?\\n1 Answer | Add Yours\\nI will need to see your model.

It plays an instrumental role in the overall development of economy through efficient mobility of both goods and services. In this regard, the role of transport infrastructure is of paramount importance in any developing nation. The present study investigates the long-run relationship among the transport, industrial and energy variables. Using cointegration approach, a three-variable system is tested. Co-integration, vector error correction model and Granger causation test have been employed in order to investigate the causal relationship between the variables in short-term and long term. We find strong causal linkage between energy, transport and industrial variables for India. Moreover, we found a unidirectional causatory relationship from energy to industrial output and from industrial to transport output. This finding supports the hypothesis of Koop et al.

In this paper we examine if the changes in stock index have an impact on real GDP (GDP growth). The study uses quarterly data over the period 1994-99 for 12 countries. The result is that there is a negative relationship, meaning that an increase in the stock price increases the real gross domestic product. There are two possible interpretations of these results. One is the fact that stock prices have a leading role in real economic activity. Second, there might be a lag in economic activities.

The analysis is based on a newly constructed panel of firm-level data from 1978 to 1990 for manufacturing, and 1981-1992 for services. Using a \\\"non-parametrized\\\" approach for estimating the productivity equation, a strong and statistically significant decline in the manufacturing sector is found. This decline is more pronounced and longer lasting in services, but it is not statistically different from the decline found in manufacturing. However, in a second stage of estimation, the effects of economic reform on efficiency are also estimated. In both manufacturing (for 2-digit SIC) and Services ((for the ISIC4-classification of 7-digits), the reforms are found to increase efficiency\",\"dissecting the ramifications of consumer defence legislation on e-commerce enterprises: an indian context\\nThe e commerce business was in the beginning established in United states but it has now unfold its branches to all the countries.

For this purpose, a comparative approach is adopted in which data from the South Asia and East Asia Survey of Public Service Motivation (2007\\u201308), which includes a survey of 1,700 civil servants in Korea and India, are used. The findings show that the level of public service motivation varies between the agencies. In contrast to the public sector, the motivation of Indian irrigation staff appears to depend much more on their own initiative, and is therefore less affected by the motivational level in their department, which in turn is affected negatively by promotions. Korean irrigation department staff are more likely to be motivated by their pay and to have been transferred to another agency than Indian staff in a similar category. This suggests that in Korean public organisations, there is less of a tendency to promote staff within their agency, whereas in Indian organisations the\",\"role of startups on indian economy\\nStartups: The Role of the Indian Economy.

This relationship is studied for various sectors, over the period 2001-2006, using the Balassa-Samuelson effect, energy productivity and energy labour ratio. The findings indicate that a positive, significant and increasing relationship exists between energy usage and productivity for the entire Indian economy. In addition, the relationship between the energy use and output is found to be more significant in case -of manufacturing sectors than in primary sector, while for both manufacturing and primary sectors it is negative at the early stage of development, but turns positive after a lag of 3-5 years.

Inflationary Effect of Oil Price Shocks: The oil shock of1973 and the oil shocks of1980 and 1988 had a significant impact on the economy both in terms of short term and long term impact. In 1974, the price of a barrel of crude oil was around $6. This price increase was due to oil exporting countries raising their prices to the United States to help pay for its war in Vietnam.

We also examine the contribution of each sector to the total output growth during the recent period. The model provides an explanation for the uneven distribution of income within the country and among different regions. While the share of agriculture in total employment has been declining, in terms of output contribution it has remained constant. In addition, while agricultural productivity has risen, output share in agriculture has declined. It is also observed from the model that the manufacturing sub-sector has contributed the maximum to both growth and employment in India. Among regions, Maharashtra has emerged as the most productive state in both absolute and relative terms in all the years since the early 1960s, with Tamil Nadu second.\\nBibliographical Information:\\nAdvisor:Majumder, S.C.; Gh\",\"india working: essays on society and economy\\nWorking class, the term used to describe manual laborers who worked at low-paid or menial jobs and who had no or only rudimentary education.

policy in India: what shapes international, national and state policy?\\nAbstract\\nClimate change is considered by most governments to be one of the most pressing issues facing the world. Climate change policy involves a number of complex issues, with the interaction and coordination of international and national governments as well as state governments, and with a range of other sectors and stakeholders. This paper examines the climate policy process in Australia and the USA (which have similar policy frameworks for climate change) and India - a developing country and one that is not party to the Paris Agreement. The research is exploratory in nature, using a qualitative method based on the analysis of documents and semi structured interviews.

Roof area constitutes a major proportion in the built environment and the roof plays a vital role in protecting the building and also in regulating the internal thermal comfort of the buildings, thus affecting the indoor climate. In the present study, the effect of using cool roofs to reduce the heat transfer into and from the structure, was investigated using a calibrated simulation tool developed based on a simplified energy model. The study was carried out using the calibrated cooling simulation model and validated it with the actual data of a typical building of India. Results obtained from this validated model were found to be in excellent agreement with field data. This model can be used for assessing the energy efficiency of buildings with different climatic conditions and can serve as an important tool for decision making of selecting the suitable materials for the roofs in different parts\",\"Policy innovations for pro-poor climate support: social protection, small-scale infrastructure, and active citizenship under India's MGNREGA\\n- From:\\nPart of the India Policy Series series\\nPolicy and Institutions\\nSynopsis \\u2018active\\u2019 citizens, the MPLAD scheme, as a key component of a new model that can be implemented at scale, is also presented.

It is estimated that 8.1% of all global anthropogenic \\u201cgreen house gas\\u201d [GHGs] emissions are from cement production. Thus, it is imperative to identify and implement climate strategies to mitigate GHGs. A literature survey has been conducted to assess the GHG emission levels of cement industries in India. The research findings have revealed a significant difference from the earlier reports in terms of GH G emissions and their mitigation strategy implementation. This work focuses on analysing the impact of climate strategy adoption for climate mitigation in the cement sector through systematic literature review and Delphi survey, and an integrated decision-making tool \\u2013 Analytic Hierarchy Process -DE\",\"Implications of climate change for sustainable water resources management in India\\nAbstract\\nThe Indian subcontinent is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate and climate-related hazards, including floods, droughts, landslides and heat waves. These hazards threaten the lives of millions of people, damage agricultural and forest resources, and cause billions of dollars in economic losses. Climate change, the increase in global temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions, will further aggravate the impact of these hazards. This is why the Indian Government has taken climate vulnerability assessments seriously, in order to inform policy development and to identify areas in need of adaptation action. In this paper, we examine what the results of such assessments might mean for managing water and other natural resources in a country like India. We find that the impacts of floods and drought are likely to increase as global warming continues, while the effects of heatwaves are projected to diminish. The effects on agriculture are also likely be severe,\",\"Carbon emissions, climate change, and impacts in India's cities\\n-\\nCarbon dioxide emissions from cities are expected to double by 2030, making them one of the fastest growing sources in the world.

The method is based on genetic algorithm which is used to optimize thermal and energy efficiency of buildings. In present study, the genetic optimization algorithm \\u2013 GA is applied on retrofits and building systems to maximize energy savings. GA based optimization method was applied for different retrofitting measures and combinations on a building with 10% heat gain reduction. It is found that 15.1% increase in energy reduction is achieved by integrating all the possible retrofit measures. This method can be used for other building types also, but in this study the method has been applied only on multi retrofitted building and the building in focus is an institutional building.\",\"Can the distribution of sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.) shift in the northeastern direction in India due to changing climate?\\nBy\\nSukanta Bhattacharjee\\non\\nAbstract\\nSal is one of the most important plantation crops that is cultivated by the people belonging to tribal communities of India, particularly in Assam.

The Indian monsoonal rainfall regime is strongly influenced by climate in the Indian Ocean, the North Atlantic, Pacific Ocean and East Asia.\\nHowever, there are some discrepancies and uncertainties in climate reconstructions of the ISM over the last several millennia and in particular over past 1000 years. This is mainly due to the lack of direct climate proxies (e.g., pollen) and the paucity\\u002funcertainty of other proxies. In this paper, recent studies from both direct and indirect proxies and models will be critically evaluated to address this issue.\",\"Role of Arabian Sea warming on the Indian summer monsoon rainfall in a regional climate model\\n- 1National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, Colorado 80301, USA\\n-.\\nThe Indian Ocean monsoons have a crucial role in the climate of the Asia-Pacific region, with their variability affecting the monopole and dipole regions of Pacific Ocean SST anomalies (see Fig. S2, available online) and their impact on global sea level variability.

The heat is generally attributed to the strong monsoonal winds, which push hot air from India into Pakistan. This wind then blows over parts the Himalayas, creating a temperature drop on the western slopes and warming of the air on its way down over Pakistan, leading to high temperatures in Pakistan in late May to mid July, and also over Northern India (see figure).

The vulnerability of this community is further amplified by its social characteristics such as a high dependence on natural resources, low income level, large household size, female-headed households, poor education levels, high illiteracy rate and low access to information. These factors are considered as drivers for climate-induced displacement and vulnerability.

A monoslope and multidomain regional ocean\\u2013atmosphere modelling experiment is performed to study how monolithic and monomodel responses to changes in sea-level pressure, temperature, and precipitation in East and Western Pacific are altered through the inclusion of a topographic uplift in the Himalayas. Two different versions are used, where the topography of the Tibetan Plateau is either modelled by using the \\\"topography-only\\\" approach or by including the effects of topographical uplift on sea level through a dynamic topogra- phy (DT).

Our study uses a combination of survey data gathered from 2005 to 2010, and weather data (rainfall, temperatures, wind speed, etc). Using these data, climate change impacts have been estimated, which in turn are expected to be compounded by other stressors such as market volatility and increasing cost of inputs like fertilizer. The impacts of these compounded stressors, on smallholders are also estimated. We find that the compunction of stressors is greater for the farmers, particularly, women farmers. These farmers are found to face higher costs of production and lower yields compared to other farming systems.\",\"Engendering adaptation to climate variability in Gujarat, India\\nDate2011-06-09\\nAuthor\\nGhosh, Anjanee\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThe Indian State of Gujarat is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and variability, owing to its coastal and deltaic nature and its high population density and agricultural dependence.

This paper presents the results of a survey of the impact of climatic variables on the rice yield in south India. It also provides an analysis of how climate variability may affect rice cultivation in future. The survey reveals the following. There is a clear increase in rice productivity during the period 1959-1979. During the same period, there was no significant change in rainfall or mean air temperature over the state of kerala. However, the number of rice cropping seasons increased from 2.5 in 1980s to 3.25 in early 1990 s. In contrast, it was noted that the rainfall pattern and temperature have changed in keralam. Thus, rice may be less sensitive to the current change of temperature but more sensitive towards rainfall patterns in coming decades.\",\"SinoIndian Climate Cooperation: implications for the international climate change regime\\nThe paper examines the implications of China\\u2019s increasing cooperation with India for international negotiations on climate protection and discusses some of the challenges that may arise.\\nClimate Protection and the UNFCCC\\nThis paper is part of an overall UNEP study to examine the effectiveness of multilateral environmental agreements in addressing the climate challenge.

Climate change and its impact on water resource availability has been a cause of concern across the world. There are several reports on the impact of climate change at global, regional and local scales. However, in India the assessment and monitoring of impact at local scale is not very common, except in certain regions like the Himalayas where water is already in shortage, and in some coastal areas where sea level rise and cyclones have been impacting the water availability. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology and approach that can assess the effect of climatic change on different water sources like surface water, groundwater, etc. In this chapter an attempt is made to develop an approach, methodology, tools and indicators to assess and monitor the climate impact and associated changes on surface and groundwater resources. The chapter is an effort to understand how climate impacts water bodies, how\",\"Farmers' perceptions of climate change, impacts on freshwater aquaculture and adaptation strategies in climatic change hotspots: A case of the Indian Sundarban (Bangladesh) and the Peruvian Manu River Basin\\nDate2017\\nAuthor\\nBhattacharya, Ayan\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThis dissertation aims at identifying and understanding farmer's perceptions on climate-change and its impacts and strategies for adaptation in a freshwater ecosystem.

This article addresses the emergence in recent decades of a \\u2018climate institution\\u2019 in New Delhi, India\\u2019s political capital. It is shown that this process of institutional emergence is not the product of an unproblematic and linear process, as is usually assumed in institutionalism; rather, it is fraught with difficulties and ambiguities, and it was achieved through the negotiation and contestation of multiple, often conflicting, visions and interests. We argue that the climate institution is, in a way, the (unintended) outcome of the particular way in which climate change has been understood in the Indian political context. Its uneven and ambiguous emergence, we argue, is due in large\",\"Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities\\nThe paper argues that migrants\\u2019 participation and inclusion in climate related decision-making are necessary if climate adaptation strategies are to succeed in protecting vulnerable communities and improving urban resilience. This will not be possible unless migrants are recognised as urban residents and their contributions in the face of climate change are formally recognised. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the experiences of and contributions of urban migrants to urban adaptation and climate resilience, particularly in South Asia.\\nThis paper is based on a research project that investigated the contribution of informal migrants and marginal workers to the resilience of low income and informal settlements in three Indian metropolises. We found that informal migrant workers and other marginal groups (such as waste workers, recyclers, street vendors, and small traders) in informal urban settlements are disproportionately impacted by climate induced changes. These groups are also excluded from the formal city governance and urban planning processes. The research suggests that a significant number of migrant households living and working in low-income settlements face extreme vulnerability\",\"Green strategies: Response of Indian banks to climate change\\n-\\nThis study examines how Indian commercial banks are responding to the risk of climate-related financial losses due to their exposure to energy and other infrastructure sectors that have a direct impact on the climate. It is found that most banks have yet to take any action to manage climate related risks to any material extent. However, this is likely to change rapidly as banks recognise the material impact of the risks and the growing expectations of stakeholders and regulators. The results also suggest that the Indian government should consider taking steps to incentivise banks in managing climate risks.\\nContents\\nIntroduction\\nClimate change and India\\nWhat is bank exposure?\\nBanks in India: climate risk factors and climate finance\\nThe climate and energy risks that banks face\\nWhy do banks not manage risk?

In the next thirty years, the climate is expected to warm by 2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit in many parts of North America, with the most dramatic temperature increases projected for the far northern reaches of Alaska, Canada, and the Arctic. As this climate shifts, communities in these areas will be impacted by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. These changes will have impacts on the economy and environment. Climate adaptation is necessary for communities to survive and thrive into the future. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reports that adaptation will likely be more cost effective than mitigation, particularly for rural communities. However, there are barriers that prevent some tribes and indigenous communities from adapting to climate changes. This study will address two main questions.

In the present paper various factors are considered which affect the Himalayan flora-fauna in a bid to predict the effect of changing climatic conditions on this unique ecosystem of biodiversity. It has been found that Himalayan Flora and Fauna are likely to be adversely affected with increase in temperature as the alpine plants are expected to suffer most due to increased temperature, while the lowland plants would be able to survive.

A literature review shows that the impacts of environmental and climatic change can be expected to increase women\\u2019s vulnerabilities as compared to men in different contexts and regions, but there is little research on this area in Indian context. Women are more vulnerable to water, food, health, shelter and livelihood issues. There are several reasons for this. Some of these are that women are mostly engaged in agricultural production and are involved in household food production as well as in livestock rearing. In rural areas women play a major role in food preparation, storage, processing, marketing and distribution. Their role is much more than that of men. They are also the ones who take care of children and household tasks and\",\"Delivery of Himalayan sediment to the northern Indian Ocean and its relation to global climate, sea level, uplift, and seawater strontium isotopes\\n- By:\\n-.\\nAdditional Publication Details\\n-)\",\"The impact of Indian Ocean mean-state biases in climate models on the representation of the East African short rains (May-June-July) over the period 1948-2015\\nView\\u002f\\nOpen\\nAuthor\\nLiu, Xiaohua\\nZhang, Jin\\nDate of Issue2017-07-28\\nSchool\\nClimate Change Research Institute, Sustainable Energy and Environment Institute\\nAbstract\\nMean-State Bias is a common error source in atmospheric models.

To explore the impacts of mean bias on East Africa, we use the ERA40 Re-Analysis data to investigate the relationship between the mean state bias and the climate variables over East Afica for 1961-1990. We found that mean biases over central and southern Africa significantly affect rainfall variability over Eastern Africa\",\"The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change. We used a model of the global dispersal of mammals to estimate the impact of climate warming on the spread of this species. Our results show that the species is unlikely to expand outside its range unless the climate warms by at least 2.3oC. Climate warming beyond these values would cause the mongose to reach areas with suitable temperature but the lack of suitable prey would limit its expansion further. This is the first time a species has been assessed for its climate suitability by combining global climate and prey species distribution data. The results suggest that climate is a better predictor of range expansion than prey availability in this invasive species, a finding that highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in the assessment of global change impact.\\nIntroduction\\nThe global distribution of species and the processes that control the extent of their range are key questions to address in order to understand the potential impact that global warming might have on species\",\"Simulating impacts, potential adaptation and vulnerability of maize to climate change in India\\nDate2009\\nAuthor\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nClimate change is expected to have a significant effect on agriculture in coming decades.

The present paper aims to understand and explore the perceptions, adaptation strategies and the coping mechanisms adopted by the forest-fringing communities of the Eastern Himalayan Region, India. For this study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the villages of North and South Sikkim, which are located in close proximity to the Tsomgo Lake and Nathula Pass, respectively. Using a mixed method approach, 500 households were surveyed by administering a self-administered structured questionnaire. A total of 300 household were also subjected to a focus group discussion. Analysis based on both quantitative and qualitative responses was undertaken and key themes were identified to explore adaptation and coping strategies. Findings of this research showed that, majority of respondents were not aware about climate related changes and were unaware about any adaptation measures undertaken by them or their forefathers.

The Indian subcontinent is the most affected by global climate change, particularly, the increase in temperature, which is predicted to rise up to 2.0-3.5 degrees C in the next 20-50 years, causing an increase of 5%-10% in global mean temperature by the year 2100.

We demonstrate that the intensity of the summer rainfall over the north-eastern Eurasia and the Arctic Ocean is controlled by climate change on the Asian continent and that this climatic signal is well preserved in sediment isotopes, which are also influenced by regional climate processes. In the last 40 k years, the monsoonal precipitation in north eastern Asia and in Arctic increased during summer, while it decreased in Eurasian high-latitude areas. The decrease of monosonal summer precipitation over Eurasians high latitudes was probably caused by increasing arctic sea ice.

In 2014, Australia was the largest exporter of coal globally and the third-largest exporter in 2002. Australia is also one of the highest emitters of carbon dioxide in the industrialised world (IPCC, 1993). Australia has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian Government has a number of international obligations to limit its greenhouse gas emissions in order to help curb climate change. This includes a commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below \\u2018business-as-usual\\u2019 levels by the year 2020. It is expected that the current Australian emissions profile will be in excess of 50 million tons of CO2-eq [1] by that date.

The study has attempted to establish a correlation between malaria and the climate and to study the influence of temperature and rainfall on malaria transmission at different seasons. Correlation between the climatic variables has also been established. A significant correlation has emerged between temperature, rainfall and incidence rate of the disease and a strong inverse relationship has developed between rainfall, and minimum temperature during summer months and disease incidence and between precipitation and temperature in winter, spring and fall months. It has further been observed that the mean temperature at a higher altitude shows a stronger relationship and that rainfall at lower altitudes shows more impact on the transmission than the rainfall in high altitudinal area\",\"The Indian Ocean dipolethe unsung driver of climatic variability in East Africa.\\nAbstract\\nThis study is aimed at understanding the role of Indian ocean dipole in the climate variability of East African region by examining the relationship between SST, sea level pressure and sea surface height anomalies, the ENSO phase and the Indian Pacific SSTA.

It is also the most important natural fiber for textile and clothing in China, India, and many other developing countries. Climate change and variability are likely to influence cotton productivity in these regions in future. The objective of this study is to simulate the potential impacts on the production of cotton, based on a global gridded data set of temperature and precipitation, which was developed as part of a previous project. For this purpose, the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the Noah-MP land surface model were used.

Explaining issue attention in Australian, German and Indian print media from 1996 to 2010\\nThis paper investigates the media coverage of climate issues in Australia, India and Germany over the 15 years of 2000-2014. We analyse how issues are framed by the print press, how the coverage varies over time and whether the climate debate influences media reporting on other environmental issues. By using a quantitative text analysis of all climate articles in three national newspapers over a period of almost two decades, we find that the frequency of coverage and the framing of the issue differ markedly from one country to the next and that media reports on climate in Germany have become increasingly prominent. However, our analysis shows that coverage in India is relatively stable and Australian media report on the problem of global warming at a similar rate as before. The paper highlights the fact that while climate is a topic of growing concern worldwide, the reporting of it by print newspapers varies substantially.

In this contribution, I show that this high variability can be explained by two different mechanisms: First, the annual monsoon circulation has been affected by the western branch of South Asian monsoons which have a more pronounced influence in this region because of their origin in Western Tropical Pacific, where the sea surface temperature and the monoswell amplitude are the highest in that region. The second mechanism is due to the interaction of this westerlies with the South India low, which is located in a narrow band in northern India. It is found that during the winter monomonsol, this interaction creates a region of high pressure in peninuslar India, called the Peninsulat India high,\",\"Climate change and threat of vector-borne diseases in India: are we prepared?\\nThe World Bank estimated the cost of climate change in 2005 for India to be $10-20 billion per year by 2030.

The results from the participatory survey show that the small-scale farmers in this region have adopted agroforestry (AGF), conservation agriculture, mixed cropping, intercropping and inter-seasonal cropland management practices. These farming practices, when practised collectively, can contribute significantly towards adaptation to climate shocks. This is because these practices have the ability to improve crop yields in droughts and floods and protect against soil erosion in floods, and to maintain soil moisture and fertility in dry spells. Moreover, the farmers' participation in various agricultural development activities such as agro-foresty, conservation agricultural farming, integrated farming and farm mechanization have improved their adaptive capacity\",\"Mapping socio-environmental vulnerability to climate change in different altitude zones in the Indian Himalayas\\nAbstract\\nThe main objective of the study was to assess and understand the vulnerability of different socio ecological zones of Garhwal Himalaya with respect to Climate change with special focus on water, soil and forest resources in a participatory way.

The effects of land use change have attracted much of the recent scientific attention, but the effects on the functioning of wet ecosystems have remained relatively poorly studied.\\nIn the present study, the influence of a changing vegetation structure and its effects are examined on wet meadow ecosystem in the Himalayan foothills, India. Wet meadows in this area are dominated by species of Carex and Juncus, which are typical aquatic wet species. In the wet meadowe studied, a gradual shift from a wet to a dry meadow can be observed. This shift can have implications for the ecosystem. We hypothesized that the vegetation composition of this wet site has been altered by anthropogenic activities, such as land clearance for cropping and shifting cultivation, and is now closer to what it would be in drier conditions. To examine how vegetation and environmental variables affect the functional characteristics of an aquatic ecosystem, we conducted\",\"Understanding farmers perceptions about climate change: a study in a North Indian State\\nAbstract\\nClimate change, being one of the important issues of today\\u2019s world, is also an issue of importance for the agricultural community.

The research objective of this paper is to study the farmer perceptions on climate changes in Uttar Pradesh (North Indian state) of India. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was administered to 100 farmers. Results of study show that farmers perceive a change in their farming conditions due to climate variability, which may be caused by climate-change. This perception is more for those farmers who have more education and experience. Farmers have perceived that climate has changed their agriculture conditions. However, they have not perceived the change due climate warming.

The results suggest that the mortality impact of heat waves is larger than that of droughts. This result holds for both the rural and urban villages. However, mortality from floods has a larger impact than does drought on the urban sample. A larger share of the increase in total population in villages is in low-rainfall areas during extreme events than during drought. In general, the impact on rural villagers is much larger for high temperatures than for drought, and for floods than drought; and vice versa for urban villagers. For rural areas, heat wave mortality impacts are larger in states with high levels of population density. Flood mortality increases faster in areas with higher population densities.): 8 (\",\"Orbital insolation forcing of the Indian Monsoona motor for global climate changes?\\nAccessinfo:eu-repo\\u002fsemantics\\u002fopen access\\nDate2021\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThe global atmospheric circulation is driven predominantly by two different kinds of insolarforcing: the meridional temperature gradient and the zonal temperature gradients. These two types offorcing can be either directly derived from the insolaion or can indirectly arise by changes in the atmospheric heat content and moisture budget caused by the solar irradiation. A recent paper has shown by using a simple coupled model that the orbital insolareforcing, in combination with the tropical sea surface temperature forcing, can lead to a global change ofthe precipitation over the tropics, which is a result of changes induced by both meridianallocation and changes of atmospheric water content. In this paper, the authors aim to examine the role ofmeridionalliation and atmospheric humidity changes as an insoleroading mechanism\",\"Four climate change scenarios for the Indian summer monsoon by the regional climate model COSMOCLM and their implications for climate impacts\\nAbstract\\nThe regional coupled climate models COSYCLONE-CLM, CCL and CLOUDY are used to study the impact of climate scenarios by 2060\\u20132089 on the climate of the Asian monsoons.

This variability appears to be connected to the variability of Indian winter mon Soons, which are associated with the El Nio Southern Oscillation, or E NSO. A strong E nSo relationship was reported to exist from 1939 to 2001, but the strength of the E So relationship varied significantly from year to year, especially from the 1960s onwards. In the recent past, the relationship has weakened, and in fact the onset of monSons during the past 50 years has become increasingly earlier. There are several factors associated to this weakening. The first is global warming, caused mainly by increasing greenhouse gases and the second is associated directly with changes in Indian monSon rainfall.

A few studies have assessed these impacts in the Indian context, but most of them are focused on the rural areas. This paper provides a review of air pollution and climate-sensitive health issues in urban areas of India. It is found that air pollutants in cities pose significant risks to the health of Indian population with the increasing number of vehicles and rapid urbanization. Air pollution has been shown to be a significant risk factor of a number health outcomes, including premature deaths (mainly from cardiovascular disease, stroke), hospitalizations, reduced lung function, decreased respiratory health & lung cancer.

The impact is studied using the model, the \\u201cCrop Yield Gap Model\\u201d. This model is a hybrid crop model that is based on the process based crop modelling system \\u201dPOWER\\u201d. A hybrid model approach was chosen as it combines the advantages of a mechanistic crop growth model and a stochastic crop water model. For the study, daily precipitation data and monthly mean maximum and minimum temperature for the crop seasons in the period 1981 to 2010 were used. We used 2 sets of precipitation \",\"harnessing leaf photosynthetic traits and antioxidant defence for multiple stress tolerance in three premium indigenous rice landraces of jeypore tract of odisha, india\\nThe study was aimed to identify the potential sources of stress in the field conditions and to understand the role of antioxidant defense in alleviating the stress conditions on three traditional rice cultivars of Jeypure region of Odisha. For the study, three land races of rice namely, Kshamal, Pundari, and Khandia were subjected to different types of abiotic environmental stresses such as salinity, drought, high temperature, submergence etc. The results of the present study revealed that the landrace Khamal showed the highest yield under drought stress condition, followed by Punda and khandi. Salinity induced severe reduction in grain yield and other agronomic traits in all the three indigenous land rases of khamil, kunda, an Pundi.

The extent to which these impacts occur, however, will depend on the exposure of vulnerable coastal communities. A major challenge is the lack of information regarding the relative impacts, and thus relative vulnerability, on a spatial scale for many coastal nations. We develop a method to map the extent and relative magnitude of the potential impacts for coastal settlements in India, based on their exposure and sensitivity to the combined effects of sea level rise, storms, drought, extreme temperatures and flooding. These are the same variables used in our earlier work to estimate global-scale relative risks to coastal infrastructure and settlements. To map these variables, we use gridded global climate data from the NASA Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase III. For a sample of coastal Indian settlements we then estimate seaward and landward displacement probabilities under climate\",\"Impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: a review\\nAbstractThe impact of increasing climate variability and climate changes on food security in the country has been discussed in this study.

The monologue nature of this climate can be explained as the strong influence of solar insolation and atmospheric dynamics on the regional circulation of monoclonal climate. In order to investigate the role of climate change in future monoclone climate, one needs to have a better understanding of its variability and predictability. To understand the climate variability, the model should be able to produce realistic monocal climate and its associated extreme. However, it is difficult to model the monoclimte accurately due to the complex atmospheric flow, land-atmosphere interactions, and strong coupling of atmospheric and land surface parameters. Therefore, to predict the future climate under climate changes, an understanding and simulation of natural and anthropogenic variability of Indian Summer Monsoon is a must.

The study aims to develop a method for local climate zone classification (LCZ) in Nagaur to improve the climate modeling of future climate change impacts in India. A combination of methods based on the temperature and humidity data from meteorological stations were applied to identify different climate zones. These methods included the cluster analysis method and the K-Means clustering approach to find the most homogeneous groups of stations. Subsequently, the results were validated against the World Climate Map developed by NOAA\\u002fNCDC. This was achieved through the application of an expert-based method, i.e., the expert committee was asked to review and select the best groupings of climate stations from the identified zones by the method of cluster and K \\u2013 means. Finally, this resulted in a classification with six zones for Naguar.

This is expected to affect the river flows which in turn could affect hydropowering. To estimate the projected change in the power output, this study has used a global hydrological model and a hydrotechnical model. Projection of rainfall under various climate scenarios has been done using two climate models, HadRM3.1 and HadCM3, with the period of 1950\\u20132035. The hydrologic model is used to simulate streamflow using the calibrated parameters for the selected sub-catchment, which is considered as a reference catchment for comparison.

The glass industry in India has come up with some new technologies in manufacturing glass, such as insulating glass to reduce heat transfer, low iron and low E glass for solar control etc.\\nWith a wide spectrum of glass options available, it is essential to select appropriate glass in order to achieve the desired performance for the application. In order for a particular glass option to perform optimally, its energy efficiency, thermal performance should be taken into consideration. Thermal performance of a building is one of the essential factors for achieving energy saving and sustainable building, and hence energy ratings is given by the government of India. This study aims to review the various energy rating systems for different kinds of glazing, glass types, thicknesses and spacings. It also includes\",\"Climate adjustments over Africa accompanying the Indian monsoon onset\\nAbstract.\\nThe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a natural oscillating pattern of the Atlantic Ocean. It is the strongest atmospheric pattern in Africa that is associated with large-scale climate variations such as the African monsoons. NAO is also a dominant pattern over Asia and Europe and thus has strong impacts on global climates, including the East Asian summer monograph. However, its impacts of African climate have been scarcely investigated.

The study used the time-frequency technique and wavelets transform to analyse tuna landings time -series of the western Indian ocean, from 1972 to 2001. Using the wave-let analysis, two dominant modes were extracted from the data. From the first mode, the annual cycle is identified; and from second mode the monthly cycle and subannual cycle are identified, and are found to be the dominant oscillators. Then, an autocorrelation analysis was applied to the second harmonic of this oscillator. Finally, a Granger causality test is applied in order to check the causation between two series. It was shown that the fishing activity is affected by climatic conditions.\\nKeywords: Wavelets, Fishery data, Granger Causality,\\nLanguage: English\",\"Climate change, sustainable development and India: Global and national concerns\\nThe global concern about climate change has been growing and it is now widely accepted, that it poses an unprecedented challenge to humanity.

The passive adaptive capacity among the Indian rural populations has been found to be relatively higher than the global average. However the passive capacity is found relatively low among those in the rural poor and vulnerable group. This implies that the vulnerable populations may face more severe impacts of climate shocks due to their relatively less ability to deal with climate variability. It is observed that rural households which are vulnerable, are more passive in their coping and adaptation strategies and the coping ability declines with increasing vulnerability. A higher passive coping capacity of Indian poor is attributed to greater household savings and access to social safety net.\",\"Integrating blue-green infrastructure in urban planning for climate adaptation: Lessons from Chennai and Kochi, India\\n- Source:\\n 3(4): 1063-1076\\n-.\",\"Impact of climate change on the Indian economy: evidence from food grain yields and prices, 1986\\u20132013\\nBy\\nRavi B.

The mon soons have a direct impact on agriculture through the distribution of nutrients from the ocean to the land, but also through floods, erosion, or waterlogging. Monsoons are a key component of climate change. As the climate changes, monosons may become more common while the length of the dry season becomes longer. This would have an impact in agriculture, as the duration of rice production in southern India is already 5 months.

This is done by applying a stochastic simulation technique to estimate the yields and yields variability of major crops in India under current climate and projected climate scenarios. We find that a significant reduction in mean and range of crop yield is possible by the end of this century, due to climate warming in the future. However, the magnitude of impact depends strongly on the climate model used for projection. The impacts vary from crop, region, climate scenario, and model. For example, for wheat, yield decrease due temperature increase is highest in models with high temperature sensitivity, while it is very low in other models.

In this study, a method of analysis by means of multivariate clustering was used to assess the impact of this phenomenon on surface-water circulation in all the three ocean basins in question.

The Caribbean vertebra fauna is dominated by the large herbivores such as the tapirs, the glyptodonts, proboscideans and mastodonders, but it contains a significant proportion of small carnivorous mammals which are absent in modern West Indies. These mammals probably originated in South America. They were not present in the West African zoogeo-graphy during the Oligocene, so that they must have been present during a climatic period that was warmer than now. This warming is suggested to be a response to a northward advance in polar ice.

The rice yield is strongly related to climate change. This study estimates the impact of climate variability and change on rice production in six agroecological zones of the Indian states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Assam. We use the 1980s-based National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting climate data and the MODIS 3-monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from June 2000 to May 2010. For this time period, we use a set of remote-sensing- and weather-model-driven methods to estimate and compare the effect of temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. Our estimates show that rice is highly affected by the temperature increase.

In the future, forests will face increasing threats from changing climate, including:\\n- Droughts and fires\\nDrought is a natural phenomenon in the dryland areas of India and is exacerbated by climate. Increasingly severe droughts, and the associated heat waves, will threaten forests and forest resources. The forests may also be susceptible to fire, as climate and temperature extremes increase and cause an increase in fire intensity. This could threaten forest ecosystems, the wildlife and human livelihoods that rely on them. It could also increase the spread of invasive and non-native plants and animals.\",\"Prospects of hybrid photovoltaicdiesel standalone system for six different climate locations in Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\\n-\\nPublication Date\\n2013\\nAbstract\\nThis paper investigates the prospects of Hybrid photovoltaics-dieseland standalone systems at different locations of India in general and TamilNadu state in particular. The paper has studied various aspects of a Hybrid Photovoltaic-Dieseland Standalone system like, solar PV generation, diesel generation and the integration of two systems. In this paper, a detailed analysis of different climatic condition has been done to estimate the solar and diesel energy availability. For the study a 100 kWp grid connected solar photovoltaically- diesel generator based hybrid system hasbeen proposed for a remote village. Simulation has also been carried out to assess the system reliability, availability and dispatch capability using Power World. It is also found that the proposed solar- hybrid-grid connected system is feasible and reliable at all the locations. Finally, it is seen that, the cost of the hybrid systems are less than the grid based photovoltaichydrogen systems for the\",\"European climate leadership in question: policies toward China and India\\nThe European Union has long been an environmental policy role model.

The mountain glaciers, the cryospheric components, have been declining in number and area since the beginning of 20th century. This is because of the anthropogenic activities, like deforestation, forest fragmentation, mining, construction and other anthropocene stressors. There is no dearth of literature on the impacts of climate change in Himalayan regions. What is more worrisome is that the glaciers in high altitudes are declining at an alarming rate, causing floods and landslides in lower regions, affecting lives, livelihoods and property. In addition to this, it is also affecting the agriculture of these regions in a negative way due to climate variability and change. Thus there is need for urgent action to save the Himalaya and its cryogenic components.\",\"Interannual climate variability over the tropical Pacific Ocean induced by the Indian Ocean dipole through the Indonesian Throughflow\\n- 13 Downloads.\\nThe Indonesian throughflow (ITF) plays a key role in the climate system by affecting the thermocline depth in both the equatorial Pacific ([1]) and Atlantic oceans and by providing a pathway for heat and salt to move from the western Pacific to the eastern tropical Atlantic [2, 3,5,6]. The ITF has strong interannual variability - both in terms of the magnitude of heat flux through it and in its strength and spatial pattern. The strength of ITFs varies on decadal timescales, and the interdecadal oscillation of strength, which has been termed the Indo-Pacific inter-decal variability, is thought to be due to variations in Indian and Pacific basin sea surface temperature forcing (). The magnitude and direction of ocean-atmosphere heat coupling associated with the variability of these basin-scale heat transports have important consequences for climate change and variability. Recent observational studies have found a strong\",\"Failure of CMIP5 climate models in simulating post1950 decreasing trend of Indian monsoon rainfall\\n- 1Department of Mathematics, IIT Kanpur, KanPur, 208016, India\\nAbstract. Indian rainfall is a highly complex hydrological phenomenon, influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. The Indian summer monsoons are highly variable, and the variability is influenced primarily by large scale atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections over the tropics. These are the primary drivers of the Indian Monsoon. A number of climate model simulations have been made to study the influence of external forcing such as greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol radiative forcing on the hydrology of India. In this paper, we compare observed data and simulated rainfall over 1951\\u20131996 for the 16 CM1 climate simulations from the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). We have also performed statistical tests for these simulations. We find that, except for some of these CM simulations, all CM IP5 simulations do not reproduce\",\"Simulation of impact of projected climate change on wheat in India\\n- From:\\nAbstract: The authors of this paper attempt to simulate the impact on the wheat crop of climate scenarios for the next 30 years, with an emphasis on temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration.

The Indian subcontinent experiences extreme variability in temperature, precipitation, and wind fields. It is also the centre of origin of several climatic regimes of global significance. This variability is largely influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the South-Asian monsoon \\u2013 the two major climate systems. However, the nature and intensity of these climatic systems are still not well understood in the context of IOD and monsoons. In the present study, we use the fractal properties of the IDFI and MDFD datasets, to quantify the dynamical complexity of climate. We find that the MDR has an intermediate range of spatial scale, while the IDDR is at a fine-scale. Furthermore, MDA has the highest range in its time scale.\\nBased on the time-space properties, it is evident that MDP and MPD are at the intermediate and fine ranges\",\"Climate implications of large warming by elevated aerosol over India\\nDate2011-12\\nAuthor\\nSiddique, H.\\nShah, J.

The country is prone to floods, cyclones, drought, landslides, earthquakes, and epidemics. In the recent past, the country has been hit by severe climate disasters like cyclone Aila (2009), cyclonic storm Fani 2019 and the earthquake in Jammu and Kashmir in 2005. This paper focuses on the perceptions, awareness, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, practices and perceptions of the community towards climate variability, climate hazards and climate predictions with respect to agriculture. It examines the role of indigenous cultural values in adaptation to climate and disasters in rural communities. For understanding the issues around climate prediction, 20 households from three villages were interviewed using semi structured questionnaires. Findings indicate that most people had a good knowledge regarding the causes of various climate events. However, a majority of them did not believe that climatic changes would affect their agriculture in future\",\"TRNSYS simulation of flat plate solar collector based water heating system in Indian climatic condition\\nDate\\nAuthors\\nJournal Title\\nConference Name\\nEvent Location\\nSource URI\\nAltmetrics\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nFlat plate collector has been extensively used for heating domestic water for many years in the developed as well as developing countries.

It shows that climate season-time-related knowledge is a complex phenomenon which is influenced by many factors including: cultural context; ecological and meteorological conditions in a particular location, social context and historical factors. The article also explores how time-seasonal knowledge can help us understand the dynamics of the local climate in relation to cultural and ecological changes as well as to climate impacts and risks. Finally, the study illustrates how the knowledge about seasonal and temporal variations in weather and climate can be integrated into climate and disaster management plans.\",\"The Rossby wave as a key mechanism of Indian Ocean climate variability and predictability\\n- 1Climate System Research Group, Max Planck Institute, Hamburg, Germany\\nAbstract.

We interpret the data in the context of changes in precipitation and temperature, based on the 18O and 17O records. During the last glacial cycle (~ 20 kyears), the southward expansion of cold air from northern mid-latitudes led to the formation of an ice sheet over northern India. The resulting climate amelioration was followed by a shift in monsoon rainfall to more southern latitudes. This resulted in higher rainfall over the southern ghat region, but with a pronounced shift to earlier and drier monsoons, which were probably related to a change in sea surface temperature - in particular, the warming of tropical waters.\",\"Observing climate impacts on tea yield in Assam, India\\nThe research project 'Impact of climate change on yield of tea in the Assam district of India (2012-2016)\\u2019, is part of the project Climate-Smart Agriculture in India, and is carried out in partnership with the Indian partner organization Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.

The heat rejection of the air-conditioner is done by a fan that drives the indoor air flow rate. It is observed that the heat load of any air conditioner system increases when the ambient temperature of a zone increases. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the theoretical energy efficiency for air cooler using evaporating and condensing heat pipes. This system has the ability to reject heat to any external zone and to absorb heat from any internal zone. A theoretical analysis for the performance and energy savings of heat-pipe based system in a single zone has been presented.

These effects can be either direct or indirect. The direct effects, mainly through variations in solar flux, are responsible for changing the atmospheric circulation and hence affecting the climate of various regions. On the other hand, indirect effects of solar variations can also modify the circulation in the atmosphere, through changes in stratospheric circulation, or the tropospheric heating, both of which can influence the weather and climate at the surface.\\nIn this study, we attempt to examine the possible impacts of sunspot activity, sun activity (UV flux) and interplanetary magnetic field \\u2014 which are three main factors responsible [directly or indirectly] for solar activities \\u2013 on Indian monsoon, winter and summer weather.

The climate of India is generally characterized by a wide variability in temperature and precipitation, resulting in wide range of agro-climatic conditions. In addition, the country is also experiencing a rise in temperatures and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. Climate changes, particularly the increase of temperature, have a strong effect on crop development, which in turn affects the crop growth parameters. Climatic changes can influence the productivity of crops by either increasing or decreasing their growth potential. This review also discusses various adaptation strategies such as changing cultivars, changing growing practices, shifting the cropping seasons and developing new crop varieties that can withstand the adverse impacts of changing climate.\\nKeywords: Climate Change; Adaptation; Climatically Induced Stress; India\\nIssue\\nSection\\nOriginal Research\\nAuthors retain the copyright of\",\"India and the global climate governance: between principles and pragmatism\\nThis paper presents a brief historical overview of India\\u2019s engagement with climate change negotiations and international law making in the context of a changing geo-politics.

It is based on secondary analysis and draws from a comprehensive set of studies on agricultural impacts. We present evidence suggesting that, due to the increasing severity of water deficits, the production of major food crops (cereals, rice, wheat and pulses) will decrease significantly in the near future. The most vulnerable crops to climate variations seem to be rice and wheat. A decline in rice yields may reach up to 40% by 2075 due primarily to water scarcity, although climate variability is expected to increase. Wheat production may decline by up 30% over the same period. Our analysis reveals a strong association between temperature and crop yield variability, as well as between water deficit and yield variation.\",\"Perceptions of climate variability and livelihood adaptations relating to gender and wealth among the Adi community of the Eastern Indian Himalayas\\nDate2022-08-30\\nAuthor\\nKumari, Poonam\\nMishra, Manas Kumar\\nSingh, Rajesh\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nGender roles and perceptions of gender are important for sustainable adaptation to climate change among mountain indigenous communities.

Climate models of global scale are able to simulate the large scale patterns and dynamics of oceanic circulation but have been found to overestimate the strength of Indian and Atlantic Oceans (AO) Walker circulations. It is proposed here that these errors are due to the inability of model to properly represent the strong winds that form the surface boundary layer in the subtropical gyres and are crucial for the ocean to be a strong heat engine. This is supported by a direct comparison between the wind speed and sea surface temperature at the 200 hPa level for a range of locations in both hemispheres. The results show that the models simulate strong eastward winds at ~ 1000 hpa and these winds are responsible for transporting water from equatorial and tropical latitudes to lat. 45\\u2218N and higher.

The Himalayan region is projected to be one of the most vulnerable regions, and cities are likely to bear the brunt of extreme climate events. This paper seeks to contribute to understanding of adaptation processes in Himalayan urban environments. Households living in two informal settlements in Shimla were studied to understand their adaptation strategies, decisionmaking processes, vulnerability and coping capacities. A mixed-methods approach was used to elicit information through a semi-structured questionnaire, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a household survey. Results indicate that adaptation to climate hazards is not yet well understood, though some households have been able to identify and implement adaptation responses. Vulnerability and capacity analyses were conducted to assess the vulnerability to and the coping capacity of households and community groups. These analyses indicated that the capacity for households to cope with climate-change impacts is affected by gender, education level, income level and household size.\\nDownloads\\nReferences\\n\",\"Links between large-scale modes of climate variability and synoptic weather patterns in the southern Indian Ocean: a multi-decadal perspective\\nAbstract\\nThis study aims to examine climate modes associated with interannual variability of large sea surface temperatures (SST) in a region of particular interest in terms of its climatic impacts, the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. The Indian Sea plays an important role in modulating the large scale circulation, including its role on global climate and weather pattern. This study examines the linkages between inter-annual sea level pressure ((TLS) pressure) teleconnections and SST variability in order to understand the interrelationships between these large climate patterns. These large modes are identified using the principal component analysis, where the first mode of inter annual variation of 30 year smoothed TLS is identified as a proxy for a large SSTA event, and the second mode is a representation of a local scale weather system.\\nThe study reveals strong connections between the sea-level\",\"The impact of climate change on Indian agriculture\\nThe Indian agricultural sector contributes to a significant portion of the country\\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), and also provides livelihood to over half of India\\u2019 s population.\\nIt has been estimated that the average growth rate of agriculture in India is around 3% per annum.

This study explores how the media in each of these languages presents the issue of global climate in a manner that reflects the cultural and ideological background of each nation. The analysis reveals significant differences between the way these issues are addressed and framed in these three languages. While English has the least amount of coverage, this is due in large part to the fact that this coverage is often in specialized magazines. In addition, there are significant discrepancies in how climate is framed and discussed in Hindi and English. Finally, a comparison of how issues such as climate are discussed across all three newspapers reveals that Malayali newspapers are more likely to discuss the political dimensions of this issue than the Hindi or English newspapers.\\nKeywords\\nGlobal warming; Media; English; Malay; Hindi;\",\"Future climate change: Implications for Indian summer monsoon and its variability\\nAbstract\\nThe current study examines future climatic trends in the summer Indian monsoons. The study is carried out by using a coupled general circulation model (GCM) with the atmospheric component driven by a 20 year control 1961-80 simulation. Two scenarios of future climate have been considered in this study, the first scenario represents an idealistic scenario and the second represents a realistic scenario. It is observed that in both scenarios the Indian Summer Monsoon will be affected. However, there is considerable difference in their intensity, and their impacts. Under the ideal scenario, both the intensity and frequency of the mon Soons decrease. Whereas, under the realistic scenarios, intensity of summer rainfall is predicted to increase and monSoons will become more frequent and intense. These findings indicate that the changes in summer climate will result in changes to the seasonal mon soons, leading to a significant impact on agriculture, water resources management, energy demand and supply and other human activities in Asia.\\nKey Words\",\"Equatorial convergence of India and early Cenozoic climate trends and its implications for India\\u2019s tectonic evolution and geologic development\\nAbstract\\nWe show that the present geotectonics of western India, especially the northward migration of the continental margin, can be explained by an equatorial migration (EM) of Africa from the T-T boundary during the Late Cretaceous.

By adding more heat energy into the atmosphere, a warming planet would tend to intensify the circulation around the pole and weaken it at the equator, where the monosons blow into land masses (in the southern hemisphere, of course). This would cause a stronger poleward flow that would lead to a more intense Indian Monsoon during warm periods and a weaker polewards flow in cold periods, with less rainfall and fewer monson events. The authors tested this hypothesis with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model with and without this effect: the model without the extra heat showed the \\u201cnormal\\u201d monsson patterns. But with the addition of extra energy the climate became more variable, and the\",\"Effect of preconditioning on the extreme climate events in the tropical Indian Ocean during summer 2002\\n- 1Atmospheric and Hydrospheric Research Center, Graduate School, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan\\nAbstract.

In 1980, India' defense allocation was 1.7% of the GDP and increased to 3.9% in 2009. India has a huge potential to increase its defence spending to about 5% or more. The government will have to allocate at least 4% to meet the increasing threats to its security. 10% will be necessary to maintain the existing force size.\\nThe total defence expenditure of India in the year 2030 is estimated as $ 600 billion.

The question whether it is really necessary for the defence of a country like India or the funds could be used for other development purposes like health, education etc. has been debated for a long time.

This has been evident in recent years as the bilateral defence ties between the two countries have grown. The two governments have concluded two landmark defence cooperation agreements since the end of the Cold War, and have been actively engaged in joint training and exercises. India is now the largest importer of US arms. Moreover, as part of a larger trend across the Asia Pacific, US and Indian military forces are increasingly engaged bilaterally through the 'two-plus-two' ministerial dialogue and other military-to-military initiatives.

This programme was first announced in 1940, by the then prime minister of Independent India, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. The aim was to make India totally self-reliant on the manufacture of defense products and systems. It was a very ambitious plan, as at that time, there were no manufacturing industries for defense goods in India. In 1957, the programme became a law in parliament. Since then, this law and many others have enabled the government and armed forces to procure defense equipment from India-based industries. However, since India is a big country, with a large population, and with many different regions, climates and terrains, it is difficult to equip all parts of the nation equally.

It has also seen an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in its defense sector. However, the defense industry has been considered to be a strategic sector, and therefore, a significant barrier has remained in the way of foreign investments. This has not only hindered growth of Indian defense manufacturing sector but has created a gap in technology and capabilities in comparison with the developed countries. The present paper attempts to review the present status of FDI in defense in India and its trends, requirements and the forecast. A critical review of available literature, reports and data has enabled the authors to identify the factors responsible for the low F DI inflows into defense and to understand that there is a strong case for allowing F I DI in certain categories in Indian defence industry.\",\"what should be the next steps as india moves to be a defence exporter\\nwhat is the process of making a product as defence export product and how much is needed to get in to the defence market\\n1 answer\\nAnswers (1)\\nThe Government of India has a very strong focus on \\u2018Make in India\\u2019 which means that the Ministry of Defence is trying to increase the manufacturing content of defence equipment.\\nIndia has started the first phase of Make in Defence programme, which is focused on creating the infrastructure in the form of a Defence Manufacturing Zones and Defence Industrial Corridors.

The decision to acquire a nuclear weapons stockpile came after a series of incidents in which India was forced to rely on other countries to defend it from Pakistani nuclear attacks.\\nAt the time, there were few options for India. India did not have the financial resources to develop its own nuclear technology, nor was India capable of building nuclear warheads without the help of an outside country. This was due to the fact that a significant percentage of the country\\u2019\\u2019 military equipment was manufactured in the United States at the end of World War II, making India reliant on Washington. In addition, India relied upon American technology to help develop nuclear weaponry. Finally, since the 1950\\u2019\\u2019, India had maintained an agreement with the U.S to buy its nuclear fuel.

The Indian government has been pursuing an ambitious \\u201cMake In India\\u201d policy to encourage domestic defence production and reduce dependence on foreign defence firms.. In the 1950s and 60s, India's defence requirements were supplied by indigenous manufacturers such as the Aircraft Factory at Nasik. This will enable India to build its own defence infrastructure and capabilities, rather relying on the foreign suppliers for the entire spectrum of military requirements. It was also felt that in the long term, such an arrangement with Russia would enable Indian firms to acquire the requisite technology to produce sophisticated weaponry. A large number of countries around the world are seeking to modernise their Armed Forces through the acquisition of the best available technology.

It has been an issue of concern for the government and for many decades there have been many initiatives launched to curb the trend of increasing attrite rate, which has not yielded results. The Indian Air Force, is an integral part of defence forces of India, the armed force is known for its strict recruitment process. But the high rate of attritions in this force has created a problem in the organization.\\nThe purpose of this study was twofold. First, to identify the factors causing attritic in IAF and to find the solution to the problem. Second, this article will discuss the effect of emotional quotient on attritis in Indian armed forces in general. A survey of 500 I.A.F personnel was carried out by researcher and questionnaire was used.

This transition is a product of a number of historical factors which include a combination of factors such as its geography, demography and economic development which have shaped its security environment - a factor that has played a significant role in determining the nature of its foreign policy and national security priorities. In addition, the transition process has had a bearing on the way security issues have been addressed, with the military playing the major role.

India is on the threshold of an economic transition where economic growth will accelerate to the next level. The country also stands poised to take a leadership role in global growth for the first time in its history.\\nWhile it is true that India has become a much stronger defence and strategic partner to several nations, its defence budget is still very small when compared to that of the US, Russia and China. It is therefore important that this is seen as a long-term goal, and not a short-cut. A larger defence outgo will not only have a negative impact on economic prospects but also on social and political goals of national development. This will also impact the country' s ability to meet its foreign aid commitments.

The paper began by reviewing the history of Indo-Australian Defence Relations, with particular reference to post 1990. In the first 30 years of bilateral relations, Australia had been a major provider of military assistance to India, particularly following Independence in 1947. However, after 1972, when India's relations with the USA were normalised, the bilateral military ties began to deteriorate as Australia became a close ally of the US and its military links with India diminished. Following the end of India?s nuclear tests in May 2008, Indo Australian bilateral defence ties were revived and the relationship has grown steadily.

India'a indenigenizing efforts began in the mid-1950s with the formation of the Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) and the Indian Ordance Department. However, these entities were primarily intended as research and development organizations rather than as manufacturing entities. It was only following a 1974 Cabinet resolution that OFB began manufacturing. Over the decades, the program has been a significant contributor to the development of a domestic defense industry in addition to providing critical capabilities to India.

The Defence Minister said India is a major defence market in the world. As part of this, India will also be able to participate in joint exercises, exchanges of personnel and joint research and development with the US. He also said that he has asked the Army chief General Bipin Rawat to look into this issue. India's defense budget in US dollar terms has more than doubled since 2002.

In order to address and handle these complex and dynamic situations there is a requirement of a holistic view of security.\\nWith the changing scenario, it is imperative that the Indian Armed Forces be made to respond in a manner in which they are able to meet the challenges of present and future scenarios.

A high defence manager is the one who has a broad vision of how the armed forces should be organised, trained and equipped; and who is able and willing to provide a lead to the system to evolve and improve itself.

This requires a clear vision of how the policy is to be implemented with appropriate institutional mechanism. The objective of this paper is twofold: to analyse the current status of the technology flow in the context of transfer of military technology from developed nations to developing nations; and to examine the possible avenues of technology development for India to become a technology provider country. To achieve this, the paper will first briefly examine why technology transfers are not happening, and then look at various options for technology acquisition. Finally, it will examine what the future holds for the Indian military in terms of future defence needs and technology.\",\"indian defence industry: an agenda for making in india\\nThe Indian Defence Industry has come a long away from the times when it was considered as an afterthought. The Indian Government is now giving it priority, by setting up the Defence Acquisition Council in 2001, and has made a series of policy announcements and measures in the last decade which have helped the industry. However, much more can be done for it, in terms of making India self-reliant, which will not only save valuable foreign exchange, but also make the country\\u2019s military more potent. This is especially so in view of the growing strategic competition with China and its allies, as well as the continuing terrorist threat from across the border in Jammu and Kashmir.

This could be done by using an electroplasma generator. This device is made from the body' s own cells and can be used to make batteries for your car, laptop charger, etc.. I am sure that there are many ways to harness this power and make them into something useful, like making batteries.

These steps include (1) identifying the needs and opportunities to develop,, and. 2. Developing the products and services and their capabilities and testing them on field. Finally, these products should be deployed in the market with the right marketing techniques.

This vision has been largely supported by US allies and allies-in-arms in Europe, North America and Asia. But the US-India alliance has become a test case for this vision in recent times. The two countries are seen by many as natural partners in the quest for global liberalism, with their shared values of democracy, pluralism and secularism underpinning their respective visions. However, the relationship has not always been an easy one. In fact, it has seen some of its worst days since the end of World War II.

It was launched after the Pokhran-II nuclear tests by China in 1995 when there was a serious concern that the Chinese nuclear arsenal was expanding at a much faster pace than the Indian nuclear deterrent.

It is premised on the notion that a nation\\u2019s foreign policy is determined by its domestic political culture and interests.

This means that a 1% increase in defence spend reduces per capita income by 0.1%. This relationship is found for both India, and for Pakistan, even though the former has higher economic output. Further, this result is robust to different sample specifications and estimation techniques. This result holds for all the sub-periods and all specifications examined.

The DDP is the most important defence procurement procedure and the main document which governs the defence acquisition process. The Defence Procurement Manual 2013 : A Guide for Procurers is a compendium of the policies and guidelines relating to defence procurements by the Ministry of Defence. Defence acquisition is responsible for procurement of various items required for military operations. This is done by procuring these items from the Indian private sector and foreign suppliers. Procurement of items through this process is also done through the Defence Public sector undertakings. In the recent years, India\\u2019s defence forces have been facing severe shortages of a variety of weapon systems and platforms.

These are the reasons for the rupees fall, but the question which arises is why has the dollar appreciated. Is the appreciation a result of higher demand and supply of currencies. The answer is not quite correct, for it is the demand for dollars that causes appreciation of dollar and vice versa. This is because dollar is used as a benchmark for pricing commodity prices. It is therefore, the increase in demand of commodities for which the price has increased. In other words it means that there was more demand. As a currency it has its value. And the more the value of a particular currency, it will be more attractive for foreign investors and traders.

The poor people are not able to access primary health facilities due to poor infrastructure, lack of human resources, inadequate supplies and poor referral mechanism. A poor health infrastructure can be defined as the \\u201clack of adequate physical resources and human resource to provide adequate health services in a given population\\u201d [1]. The health system should be able not only to ensure health of all but also to promote healthy life \\u2013 long and productive population. Health care facilities should not be restricted to hospital based services and should reach the community through primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. In this context health is defined in terms of physical, mental and social dimensions.Health should promote social justice.

Nair*\\nRural Infrastructure Development\\nThe concept of infrastructure was given a new lease of life in the early 2000, in response to the globalisation and market liberalisation, which is taking place in India and the world in general. Infrastructure is defined in its broadest form as \\u201cphysical infrastructure\\u201d that provides the essential services for people to sustain life, including housing, sanitation, water, transportation, education and health. (World Bank 1998).\\nIn rural areas, infrastructure is a vital component of development as it is an essential prerequisite for development activities. For example roads, power, communication and drinking water facilities are some of the infrastructure which are essential for economic development.\\nHowever, these essential infrastructure facilities need to be provided at affordable prices and at a sustainable scale to all. There are three main reasons for the failure of rural infrastructure development\",\"Material circularity potential for construction materialsThe case of transportation infrastructure in India by S.R.

However, few studies explore the impact of public infrastructure on private school choice and school quality. Using a unique dataset with a detailed geographic information system for the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, this study estimates the effect of infrastructure development around private and public schools on the probability of students achieving the minimum level of primary schooling. In addition, it investigates how the infrastructure around schools may influence the quality of the private education offered. This paper shows that students living in low-infrastructure areas are 2.1 times more likely to drop out of school. Moreover, the presence of higher education infrastructure is negatively related to enrolment in private primary schools. The proximity to public primary, secondary and tertiary education facilities also influences schooling outcomes, especially in terms of dropout rates in public and private private schooling and enrolments in primary education.\\nKeywords\",\"Feasibility analysis of electric vehicle charging infrastructure deployment in India\\nThe present study evaluates the feasibility of deploying Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations across various Indian cities with an objective of providing an energy source for electric and plug-in hybrid cars.

It provides a platform to connect people and businesses and enables trade to flourish. This study aims to analyse the economic benefits to rural and regional development from the improvement of infrastructure by assessing the impact of different categories of roads. The study focuses on the road infrastructures of rural areas. In the Indian context there was the need to assess the benefits accruing to agricultural growth in rural India. Hence the study also focused on agriculture in general and the role of agriculture to improve the quality of life of the rural people as well as on its role in the economy. For these reasons a study is carried out to examine the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth of two states, Karnataka and India, and to evaluate their performance in infrastructure. To this end, an attempt was done in this study to measure the performance of these two countries in terms of various\",\"Railroads of the Raj: Estimating the impact of transportation infrastructure on economic growth\\nThis study investigates the relationship between transport investment and economic performance using a new data set on the investment, performance, and geography of rail and roads in the British Raj. The data are based on annual reports of railway companies, government surveys, official censuses, local gazetteers, land ownership registers, censorial records, court documents, railway timetables, passenger and freight tariffs and receipts, maps, correspondence, photographs, newspaper advertisements, architectural drawings, engineering drawings and reports, etc. Using panel data regressions of 1870-1945 and spatial econometrics for 1910, this paper finds strong positive associations between investment in transport infrastructure and GDP per capita growth across regions of all scales. This relationship is strongest in areas where the population was least mobile, where transport costs, especially in terms of time, were highest. It is not clear whether or not these associations are spurious. If they are not, transport may have been the key to British economic success\",\"Sanitation in Mumbai's informal settlements: State,'slum', and infrastructure\\nDate2016-11\\nLanguageen\\nTypeJournal Article\\nAccessibilityOpen Access\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nCitation\\nNarain, M. 2017.

With the advent of globalization, it is necessary for the infrastructure in the country to be upgraded, expanded and developed with more efficiency and effectiveness. Automation of infrastructure projects can be a very effective solution to meet this demand. However there are several challenges that face the implementation and adoption of automation in these projects. This paper discusses the key challenges in automation of these infrastructure sectors and suggests a framework for addressing them.\\nKeywordsIndia, Automation, Infrastructure, Challenges, Framework\\nI. INTRODUCTION\\nToday\\u2019s world is witnessing rapid growth in all sectors like industrial, commercial, agriculture, and infrastructure, which have a direct or indirect connection with the use of information & communication technology (ICT) [1].

The econometric analysis is based on the system GMM model using panel data of 14 South American countries. It has been found that the level of income per capita in a region has positive correlation with the amount of road infrastructure and the number of kilowatts of electricity produced. However, the effects of these two types of infrastructural development on economic growth are different. Road infrastructurally developed regions show higher rates of growth in income but the effect of electrical infrastructure is limited.\\nKeywords\\nReferences\\nAnwar I. and Razzak S. (2003).

The PBSS are a combination of bicycle, docking station and a management system for a bike-rental service. There are different types of docking stations, which include fixed docking, free floating, and smart docking systems. PBRS can play a crucial role in improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion, providing a viable alternative to private automobile ownership, encouraging exercise, supporting local and national tourism and improving the quality of life in cities by providing an additional transportation option. This paper discusses the existing infrastructure of PBST in the global cities. Then the PB systems are analyzed based on the parameters of cost, efficiency. And finally, the conclusion is drawn that the current PB infrastructure is very less in India when compared to the other countries.

However, in the aftermath of the project' completion, the road network was unable to meet the expectations of users and has failed to achieve the level of traffic it is capable of supporting. To address the issue, this paper uses a large-scale survey of over 1000 households on the GQL and a road-network travel cost model to assess the role of road infrastructure in household travel decisions. A number of factors are found to be important determinants of household' choice of travel mode, which are also found in a previous survey.

This fast growth has created the need for more infrastructure. According to the estimates, India needs to invest US$ 1 trillion in next 15 years.

Second is that the infrastructure should be able to cater to rising demand in services like transport, health, education etc. Third, it needs a large investment\",\"Infrastructure, externalities, and economic development: A study of the Indian manufacturing industry\\nAbstractThis paper analyzes the impact of government infrastructure on the location choice of manufacturing firms, the role of transport and infrastructure in the transmission of external spillovers of pollution and the relationship between the development of infrastructure and regional industrialization. We use the Census of Manufacturing Industries in India to study the determinants of location and capital structure, as well as the effects of regional differences in infrastructure quality on industrial location. The results confirm that there is a relationship of causation between infrastructure investment and industrial growth. However, there does not seem to be any direct relationship in terms of a positive impact on manufacturing employment. Furthermore, it seems to imply that the quality of roads is the most significant determinant of industrial development. Finally, we also show that infrastructure has a strong impact in reducing the level of environmental pollution generated. This implies that investment in roads may be a more efficient way of improving the environment rather than investment to improve the efficiency of production: 111\",\"India infrastructure database 2005-2006\\nExpand view\\nThis is the fourth edition of the India Infrastructure Database.

The data are taken from a household survey in 1998. A multinomial logistic regression model has been adopted for the analysis. It is found that the demand for and utilization of primary care has increased with age, female gender, urban residence and higher education. Demand for hospital services has also increased over the period of the survey but has declined over time. Provisioning has improved over a period and has reached the rural communities as well. Female gender and urban residency have had a positive effect on the use of modern health facilities. However, the level of education and rural or urban resident status have not had any influence on health services utilization. Finally, this paper concludes that in the absence of adequate supply of infrastructure the need for health provision will be met through out-of-pocket expenditure or private health): \",\"Evolution of Financing Needs in Indian Infrastructure Industry\\nBy Suresh Reddy\\nIndia is a country with a population of over 1.3 billion people which is growing rapidly.

It examines the extent to which infrastructure investment is an important determinant of growth at state level. The analysis shows that states which invest more in physical infrastructures are likely to see higher rates of economic growth, but that the impact of infrastructure on economic development is not uniform across states, with some states being more responsive than others to infrastructure-induced growth. Further, the analysis reveals that infrastructure investments are more likely in states whose growth rates have been higher, indicating a \\\"catalytic\\\" effect.

The recent turn to financial markets to finance infrastructure projects has resulted in a proliferation of new financial instruments such as Public Private Partnerships, Public-Private Partnership Bonds, Social Investment Bonds and Special Purpose Entities. These new financing mechanisms and financial intermediaries such the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank have been used to attract public funds and mobilize private investment through the use of innovative financial structures. However, these new mechanisms have not been accompanied with the political reforms which would allow for the development of a public infrastructure market. This paper explores the implications of this turn, focusing specifically on three countries: India, Kenya and Colombia. It draws on case studies to explore the ways in which the financial turn has affected the politics of infrastructure and public debt.

This study analyzes the investment decisions and the capacity development of India's airport operators in post privatization era in order to ascertain the impact of privatizing and regulating the Indian air cargo industry. The study also examines the effects of macroeconomic factors on the airport investment in India over the period of 1995 -2010. Using co-integration and error correction modeling approaches, the study examines various determinants of airport capacity and investment by airport operator and identifies the factors responsible for the growth in airport investments in this period. Further, we also identify the sources and magnitude of the macro factors that affect the airline industry and in turn affect airport capacities and investments. We find that the privatized airports are more likely to invest in their infrastructure and increase capacity in response to economic growth.

The study sought to examine different factors that have contributed to poor development of human habitation in urban and rural areas. This has been done through an analysis of factors such as lack of access to land, inadequate infrastructure, high cost of land and housing, and poor access for water, drainage and waste facilities. It has also sought answers to questions such, as why some settlements have developed at faster rates than others, why there is still a large disparity in the provision of services across regions and urban areas and why infrastructure provision has remained a constant issue in rural and small urban settlements despite government interventions over the years. To address these questions, the research has employed a mix\",\"Impact of infrastructure on productivity: case of Indian registered manufacturing firms\\nAbstractIn the present paper I try to examine the impact of infrastructural facilities on labour productivity for Indian manufacturing industries. The paper uses data from the Annual Survey of Industries and the National Sample Survey Organisation for the years 1999-2001. I examine two dimensions of the productivity of an input, that is, labour and capital, and find that the infrastructurals are very important inputs for manufacturing units. A unit which has better infrastructuring has higher labour as well as capital productivity.

The study is based on the theoretical arguments on which the European Union\\u2019s Structural Funds are based. It uses a set of econometric models to test the effect of capital accumulation on GDP growth. Empirical evidence for this purpose is extracted from 18 European countries for the period 1970-1997, with the aim of investigating the relationship between growth and investment. An empirical investigation of this relationship is carried out by means of a system of panel cointegration and vector error correlation models with structural breaks. This is a challenging task because the empirical literature on structural change has been largely neglected. Results reveal the existence of an inverse relationship in all countries studied between total infrastructure capital stock and GDP. These empirical results are robust, even after controlling for various macro-economic variables, and can be explained by a combination of two mechanisms: direct and indirect ones.

While a growing number of studies document the environmental impacts of infrastructure on land and ecosystems, little is known about the ecological effects of highway transportation on marine ecosystems. This study investigated the impacts on benthic macrofaunal communities of a marine embankment built along State Road A-1-A (SR 1) in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The study included two sections of SR - 10 miles each, with one section built over the 1992-1993 period and the control section not built until 2001. Both sections were sampled during low tide in the summer of 2012. We compared the assemblages and abundances of bivalves, gastropods, crustaceans, nematodes, echinoids and other marine organisms from the two embanked sections to the nearby controls to determine which section of Highway \\\"A-I\\\" has the greatest negative impact\",\"Reengineering urban infrastructure: how the World Bank and Asian Development Bank shape urban infrastructure finance and governance in India and Vietnam\\nAbstractThe World Banks and the Asias Development Banks (ADB) 2005 Asian Urban Development Report [ADR] argues that the Asian urban crisis is rooted in the poor governance of urban services. It is the governments failure to invest in urban service provision that is at the heart of the problem - governments in Asia are not investing the necessary amounts in infrastructure, especially in cities. As such, it advocates increased investments in city infrastructure to support rapid and sustainable urban growth. This chapter explores how these institutions shape the urban agenda and support the reengineering of infrastructure and services in Asian cities through investments and policy.\\nThe chapter is divided into four parts. In the Introduction, the role of international financial institutions 1 2 is examined. Part two explores the relationship that exists between the two institutions: ADB, in its various incarnations 3 4 5 6 and World 7 Bank\",\"Infrastructure For Agriculture & Rural Development In India Need For A Comprehensive Program & Adequate Investment\\nThe 2nd International Conference on Agriculture, Nutrition and Food Security for Sustainable Development (ICANFS \\u2013 2017)\\nIn 2006 Government of India [GoI] launched an ambitious program for infrastructure development in agriculture and for rural development.

A review of current adaptive design and construction practices in higher eduction institutes was carried out to assess the state of adaptation in this area. These practices were then evaluated based on a set of indicators to identify gaps in adaptive capacity in Indian educational infrastructure design practice. The identified gaps were assessed for current practices, as well as for future adaptation requirements. This analysis was followed by a discussion of potential adaptive pathway opportunities in urban India and suggested measures for improving disaster resilience. It is concluded that adaptive educational practices are still nascent in many parts of India. Current and emerging practices require greater attention from educational stakeholders as part of an adaptive strategy for infrastructure for the disaster risk and climate change era to develop.\\nKeywords\\nDOI:\",\"Governance Issues in GIS Infrastructure in India\\nAbstract - GIS technology was introduced in the Indian scenario as a part of the Government Information Infrastructure (GII).

Despite its popularity, there is limited empirical evidence on the performance of PPPs in terms of their ability to deliver high-quality infrastructure and services and achieve development goals. A review of existing studies indicates that the PPP model has not always delivered the promised outcomes of highquality infrastructures, reduced costs, enhanced efficiency, and increased service availability. This study aims to identify the factors that may be constraining the ability of the public and private sectors to achieve these objectives through PPP in the context of India.

An empirical analysis for India\\nAbstractThe main objective of this paper is to study the impact of governance qualities and information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure on the performance of tax collection in the country of India. It is argued that the quality of political institutions is the key determinant of the overall tax performance. In particular, it is believed that a better and more responsive governance structure and stronger accountability are the main preconditions for successful tax mobilizations. The empirical tests show that in general, higher tax revenues are achieved by better quality political environment. On the other hand, ICT infrastructures seem to play a very important role in tax administration and collection systems of various countries. A significant and positive relationship between these variables is revealed by the study. Thus, we conclude from our empirical findings that ICT can play the crucial role by increasing the collection of revenues. We believe that our results can help the Indian Government for the effective and efficient collection and utilisation of public taxes.

We find evidence against the null hypothesis of long run cointegration of these variables. The result implies that infrastructure development, in turn, enhances economic development and foreign investment. However, the effect of foreign influsions on domestic investment is insignificant. Moreover, we test the significance of the causal relationship between investment-GDP and between FIRD and growth and find significant long term relation between the two, implying that foreign FIPs have a significant and positive impact on economic: 1257-1261\\nContact details of provider:\\nWeb page: in: Empirical Economics \",\"Post-tsunami resettlement in Sri Lanka and India: Site planning, infrastructure and services\\nDate2004-07\\nLanguageen\\nTypeJournal Article\\nAccessibilityOpen Access\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nCitation\\nKulatunga, N., Kariyawasam, P.K. & Kulkarni, A.S.P.A.M.D.V.G.J.W.R.B.C.T.O.N.H.F.L. et al.

The model takes account of technological progress, population, and environmental degradation. These variables are related to the production functions, the demand for infrastructure and their prices. In a national system, it is assumed that a country is a homogeneous unit and the infrastructure supply is determined by the prices prevailing in the economy and technological change. A regional system takes into account the regional nature, i.e., the spatial nature of infrastructure requirements and its demand. It is shown theoretically, as well as empirically that the model is capable of capturing the dynamic interaction of factors affecting infrastructure demand and supply and hence provides a useful model for the analysis of long term infrastructure planning. Further, a simulation analysis is carried out to study the interaction between infrastructure, technological advance and population\",\"Globalisation and the changing face of port infrastructure: The Indian perspective\\nAbstract\\nThe paper examines the impact of economic liberalisation on port and port-related infrastructure in India, with specific reference to port capacity development and management, port governance and regulation, and private investment in infrastructure.

We use a unique, comprehensive, and nationally representative survey (National Family Health Survey-four, NFCS-IV) to analyze the coverage of various immunization services, access to public hospitals with emergency services and the quality of public health facilities in these rural regions. In the analysis, we also control for the state of health and demographic characteristics of people to capture the heterogeneity of the region within India and to isolate the impact of these facilities from the other determinants. The key findings are that the states with low human capital and poor demographic outcomes have low coverage and quality in terms of immunization programs. Also the access, quality and cost of care in public sector hospitals is better in states which have high human development. Thus health service infrastructure is a critical determinant of coverage, accessibility and health outcomes\",\"Syndication of VCPE investments: Evidence from the Indian infrastructure sector\\nWe analyse syndication transactions in the Infrastructure Debt segment, one of the largest segments of Indian corporate debt market.

This is in part because the larger syndicated loans tend to be allocated to banks based on their relative performance \\u2013 in terms of profitability and size. In the absence of such performance-based allocation, syndicator banks are more willing to share risk.\\nThe analysis shows that there is a strong relationship between syndicability and the relative size of each bank.

As a result urban governments in many developing cities have begun to take an interest in poverty\",\"Constellation design of remote sensing small satellite for infrastructure monitoring in india\\nAbstract\\nThe infrastructure system in India, is a major contributor of GDP and is also a critical factor for the overall development of the country. The development and maintenance of an efficient infrastructure is of utmost importance and it has been a subject matter of research for quite long. A lot of technologies and tools have been developed to help the infrastructure managers in this regard. Remote sensing satellite technology provides a cost effective way to monitor the condition of infrastructure and also helps in the identification of possible threats in an early stage. In order to meet the ever growing demands of this field, the remote sensor systems need to evolve continuously. India's own remote satellite is the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS). IRS has a long history and in recent times has also been playing a significant role in monitoring the national infrastructure. This thesis deals with the design and development on an advanced remote observation system based on the IRS. It is intended to be an all round monitoring system for national level infrastructure in a\",\"Infrastructure and public works in colonial India: Towards a conceptual history of the British Raj\\nAbstract\\nColonialism in the subcontinent of India was accompanied by a large-scale expansion of modern public and civil infrastructure, as well as an extensive public building programme, including the establishment of an Indian Public Works Department. In the context of British rule, public infrastructure was a key element of political power, and the building of colonial infrastructure became a major instrument of imperial policy. However, little has been written about public architecture and infrastructure from a historiographical perspective. The present chapter will therefore examine, from an analytical perspective, both the nature of public buildings in Colonial India and their role as symbols of power and colonial rule. It will be argued that, although the buildings were often impressive in terms of architectural design, they were, in reality, an inadequate symbol of a modernised state and a civil society. They represented the colonial power's control over the local population rather than its political and\",\"Urbanization in Asia: governance, infrastructure and the environment\\nDate2019\\nAuthor\\nMukherjee, Arundhati\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nRapid urbanization (URB) in the Asia Pacific is often seen as the key driver of economic, social and cultural change. In this thesis I explore the implications of this phenomenon in three Asian countries - India, China, and Bangladesh. I look at the challenges of infrastructure development, governance issues of land and environment, gender and class dynamics and their implications on urban growth. These issues have been explored in a historical perspective in each country. The focus is on the last two decades as a period of URB in these countries. India has undergone a rapid growth of urban population from 30% in 1991 to 37.7% 2011. This has brought along its own set of challenges, particularly for the poor. China has experienced the largest scale urban URM in any country in history with urbanisation reaching \",\"The Role of Development Finance Institutions in Infrastructure Development: What Nigeria can Learn from Bndes and the Indian Infrastructure Finance Company\\nAbstract\\nThis paper examines the development finance institutions (DFI) in general and infrastructure development financial intermediation specifically with emphasis on the Brazilian National Development Bank \\u2018BNDE\\u2019 in particular. It examines DFIs role in the infrastructure value chain from the perspective of infrastructure funding in Brazil and India.\\nThe paper argues that DFEs can play key role as catalysts of economic growth in developing countries through infrastructure financing. This can be done by providing financial guarantees or by directly funding the construction of projects. DFAs provide financial guarantee to private and public investors for financing infrastructure projects in a country where there is lack of institutional financing or a weak credit rating system. In addition, the paper shows that infrastructure investment can create employment and increase productivity. The paper also suggests ways of promoting infrastructure in Nigeria in order for the country to benefit from such projects as is the case with China and South Korea. These countries are the most successful\",\"Towards a comprehensive understanding of public private partnerships for infrastructure development in Sub-Saharan Africa\\nPublic Private Partnership (P3s) are widely recognized as a key mechanism for financing and delivering infrastructure projects in low- and middle income countries. However, they have not had the desired effect in Africa. To date, only a small number of P3 projects have been successful. This is despite several countries, such as Ethiopia and Ghana, developing a robust legal and administrative framework to facilitate P2s. Despite this progress, many governments in sub-Sahara Africa are still reluctant to develop their own PPs.\\nThis paper aims to provide a holistic view of PPPs by looking at PPS in the subSaharan region, from conception to implementation, with the aim of identifying the barriers to successful implementation. It provides a conceptual overview of the PPP framework, the role of private investors and financing institutions, and outlines the main legal, contractual, financial, operational, political and regulatory issues. Drawing from empirical evidence gathered in a\",\"Dynamics among banking penetration, transport infrastructure, and regional growth: an empirical note from Indian states\\nThis paper analyzes the relationship between transport and bank branches in 36 districts of India from 2001 to 2011. We investigate whether there is a link between the two at the aggregate, state, or regional level. The data set contains 2,300 districts. At the regional scale, we use the district level distance to the state headquarters as a proxy for bank penetration. Transport infrastructure is proxied by distance of the center of district to state capital. Our empirical analysis shows that transport does not impact banking, but banking impacts transport. In contrast to earlier research, the effect of banking is more significant on rural than urban areas.\",\"Factors affecting the success\\u002ffailure of road infrastructure projects under PPP in India are examined.

It focuses on the challenges that PPP projects are facing due to Covid-induced economic slowdown and lockdown. This analysis is based on primary data collected from the stakeholders and government officials who are involved with PPP models in India. The challenges in PPP project due COVID -2019 are identified on different parameters such as project funding, project implementation and operations and maintenance. Based on these challenges, the paper highlights the need of restructuring of PPP model to ensure that the projects can sustain and provide long term benefits for the society. In order to overcome the financial hurdles in project development, it is suggested that government should introduce PPP policy with a focus on financing and debt management. Government should also provide incentives for investment in infra.

Using a vector error-correction method, we investigate the role of infrastructure in the growth of output in different regions of India, and the contribution of the different components of capital input to the output of different infrastructure sectors. Our findings reveal that the elasticity of growth in infrastructure to its output is higher for capital and less so for labor. We find that there is a strong positive relationship between growth rates of regional GDP and infrastructure. Further, the regional differences in infrastructural inputs for a given level of GDP indicate that infrastructure is not equally important for every sector in all the regions. This finding is particularly true for the power sector; in fact, infrastructure investment in this sector is much less important in certain states. In contrast, there seems to be a significant and positive role for infrastructure for manufacturing and agriculture. These two sectors are more capital intensive in nature, indicating\",\"effect of water borne diseases on indian economy: a cost-benefit analysis\\nThe study of health-economy nexus has become more prominent in the last decade. The objective of the present paper is to estimate the health loss in terms of present value (in crores of rupees) due to waterborne diseases, which are caused by the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. A model is used to analyse the effects of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis, jaundice, malaria, dengue, encephalitis, typhoid, and tuberculosis. In the model the total health expenditure of a country is divided into two components namely the direct costs incurred on the treatment of patients and loss of productivity of healthy people. Direct health expenditures on treatment are estimated based on data from WHO and the World Bank, whereas the loss due of lost productivity is estimated using data on productivity loss from the National Commission on Population.\\nWe find that choleramainsl cause an expenditure\",\"Logistic management-a case study with special reference on physical infrastructure, logistics & transportation (with special emphasis on transportation management) 1 \\u002f 5.

The study focuses on the provision of access by private companies and households to the water sector. It examines whether the poor have been helped and whether access is sustainable. Access to safe water has increased in all districts except two. Water quality has improved and the number of users has grown in most cases. Private companies have played an important role in providing access for some groups, especially the urban poor. However, in other places, the state, NGOs and community organizations have provided a larger proportion of the infrastructure. This shows that there has not been a clear shift towards the private sector in the sector as a whole. Households have benefited from microcredits in terms of increased access, improved sanitation levels and improved quality of water. There are a number factors that explain why the results of micro credits do not translate into access.\",\"Transforming the nation's logistics infrastructure with 'intelligent' technology.\\nAerospace and Defense\\nInfrastructure\\nManufacturing\\nLogistics\\nAutomotive Manufacturing\\nHealthcare\\nRetail and Consumer Goods\\nOil and Gas\\nUtilities and Energy\\nTechnology\\nEducation\\nGovernment Services\\nFinancial Services and Insurance\\nTransport and Logistics\\nPublic Sector\\nThe world is becoming more complex with each passing day.

There is a strong consensus that the infrastructure development in the country has been lagging behind in comparison to the global scenario. It is observed that there has not been much investment in infrastructure, in spite of high growth rate witnessed in recent years. In this context a detailed analysis of Indian infrastructure sector has become necessary. This paper is an attempt to study the political factors behind India\\u2019s infrastructural development. The analysis reveals that political factor is one of major factors influencing the growth in infrastructurals in Indian scenario; however, the extent of political influence varies with infrastructure type and its sub-type.

It focuses on the investments in grid and non-grid infrastructure, as well as on their impact on electricity consumption, agricultural growth, and poverty. The results show that infrastructure spending has a positive effect on per household electricity demand. Infrastructure investments also have a strong impact in terms of their multiplier effect, both in the electricity sector, which is the focus of the analysis, but also on agricultural productivity and rural poverty reduction. These results are consistent with the notion that electricity generation, in turn, leads to the creation of productive uses of labour and thus increases economic activity.\\nThe study concludes that investment on energy infrastructure can improve the living standards of people in rural areas, while generating employment in urban areas. This has been achieved by a significant increase in agricultural output and a decline in poverty levels. Overall, the benefits of these investments outweigh the costs, even if one considers\",\"Feasibility of implementing IPD approach for infrastructure projects in developing countries.\\nAbstract\\nThis paper provides an assessment of the feasibility of applying the IPDP for developing nations.

It is found that the growth in all infrastructure measures has been positive during the entire period considered. The average growth rate in 1998\\u002f99 to 2004\\u002f05 was 2.1 per cent. There has not been a consistent pattern among the regions of the country.

Second is an infrastructure quality gap which, they say, may explain as much as 25% of India's growth performance.

The traditional public funding model for infrastructure projects is being questioned by the global recession. A number of countries have started to use innovative financing methods such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), tolling and congestion charging, or user fees \\u2013 such methods could be used to help finance infrastructure more cost effectively and reduce the fiscal pressure on public finances. At the same time, new financial products, such those developed by international financial institutions, are being used by governments to finance projects.

We find that the infrastructure performance of the least-developed states increases when political parties change and the number of coalition governments falls, while it declines when the political system remains stable. The results suggest that coalition parties and stable government may increase the risk of corruption and lead to more political rents for politicians, which in turn may reduce public investment. These results are robust to a variety of specifications and empirical strategies. They also remain significant after controlling for economic factors and other institutional differences such as land use regulation, and after the inclusion of lagged and lag-squared infrastructure indicators in the analysis.\",\"Comparative analysis of profitability of real estate, industrial construction and infrastructure firms: evidence from India\\nPratap Chandra\\nThe main object of this study is to find the differences in profitability among real-estate, infrastructure, and industrial and construction firms operating in India with respect to the various financial variables that affect financial performance.

We employ the Bayesian spatial autoregressive model for the spatial transmission of coronavirus disease, as well as a time trend model to analyze the role of social structures and the government response in mitigating its impact.\\nWe find strong evidence that the size and density of urban population are significant predictors of infections and deaths in cities and towns in 2020. In terms of mortality, the effect of density on infection is twice that of population density. Moreover, our estimates reveal that cities with large populations and a low density, like Chandigarh, Delhi NCR, and Mumbai, had a higher infection and death rate compared to cities like Lucknow,\",\"Place-based public investment in regional infrastructure, the locational choice of firms and regional performance: the case of India\\nThis paper examines the impact of public investments in infrastructure on the location choices, firm performance as well as the economic performance of regions. The empirical analysis focuses on India, a developing country which has witnessed a surge in public infrastructure investment, particularly in the transport sector. This study examines three main aspects of infrastructure provision: (i) the level of the provision of transport infrastructure across the country, \\u2018place-making\\u2019 infrastructure that is, transport links that are not only of high quality but also connect different regions and cities;,and 3) infrastructure as a locative asset.

Yet, to date, research has largely failed to address the issue of power inequalities, which can be seen as the key driver behind the rapid development and expansion of renewable energy systems. In India, the state government has been implementing renewable projects across the country to meet the growing demand for electricity. Kerala is at the forefront of this development in the south, having installed more than 3,800 MW of grid solar in just over ten years. The expansion has led to a surge of new projects and a proliferation of land acquisition in order to access sufficient land for development. But the local communities are often not consulted and their views disregarded in planning. This paper investigates the social, environmental and economic impacts on communities in two different districts. It highlights how power inequality is reproduced as land rights are not protected; how communities\",\"Productivity and technical efficiency in Indian states' manufacturing: the role of infrastructure, size and location\\nThis paper examines the technical, physical and social infrastructure and productivity levels in the manufacturing sector in 28 Indian States in three different industrial classifications: large, medium and small. A non-parametric approach of data envelopment analysis is used to derive the production frontiers and measure the productivity of manufacturing establishments. The data covers the period between 1997-98 and 2001-02. We also use panel regression analysis to examine the effect of these infrastructure indicators and size of the establishment on the level of production. Finally, we estimate the total factor productivity, its components and decompose it into its labour and physical components. Our findings show that there has been a marked improvement and convergence in all the States, as evidenced by the significant improvements in total and labour productivity. Productivity gains were also found to be higher in large and medium sized firms and in those located in urban areas.

It is difficult in such areas to get immunization for children under the universal immunization programme. A study of immunizing facilities and immunization status of children of slum dwellers of Kolkata has been undertaken to determine the availability and accessibility of such facilities. Materials and methods: The study population included 3000 mothers (50% males and 50 % females) of age 0-5 years from 12 slams of 6 wards of North, South and Central Kolkata. All the mothers of these children were interviewed to collect data. Immunization status was also ascertained through the immunisation cards of all the children. Results: Out of a total population of approximately one lakh slummers, only 25% of them had access to health facilities available under universal immunizations programme, 10-25 %.

In addition, there is evidence to suggest that a 1 percent increase in the ratio between the capital and the GDP is associated with a decline in real GDP of 0.7 percent. However, it may also be argued that an increase of capital spending of one unit increases GDP by about two units for every unit spent as an input in capital-intensive manufacturing industries.

Increases in power and water supply per capita lead, on average, to population increases of about 0.2 and 1.5 per annum respectively. These findings are robust to various robustness checks.\\nS.Suresh & V.Krishna, 2004. \\\"The effect of public infrastructure on economic growth: Evidence for developing countries,\\\" Applied Economics, Taylor &\\\\; Francis Journals, vol.34(13), pages 1497-1503.

It also investigates if these perceptions differ depending on whether communities are members of the dominant Aruna tribe, the indigenous Gaddi tribe or the Bodo tribe. We argue that the nature of perceptions differs for communities that are differentially located on the same land. Using 24 in-depth interviews of people from all three communities, as well as 11 focus group discussions, we found that communities differed in their attitudes depending whether or not members were from the Arna tribe; Arunas are more likely to be supportive of infrastructure. This is because the project has direct benefits for the community. In contrast, Gadis and Bodos are less supportive and more opposed to the development. However, Bodes are also likely beneficiaries of this infrastructure as a\",\"India's charging infrastructurebiggest single point impediment in EV adaptation in India is charging.\\nThe report, authored by a team from the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, a US-India think tank, said the country'a.\",\"JUE insight: Infrastructure and Finance: Evidence from India's GQ highway network\\nInfrastructure development in India has been a top priority of the government of late.

We find that in general the average venture capitalists get 2 to 3 times of his\\u002fher money back, though a few firms do extremely well. In terms of returns, we see that exits through trade sales or initial public offerings are more profitable than through buyouts. However in terms investment returns venture funds do poorly, since the portfolio firms are mostly in growth phase. There is a clear correlation between the size of venture capitalist\\u2019s commitment and the investment made by him.

This paper analyses how governance mechanisms have been used to structure PPPs to facilitate their success and the relationship between the institutional and structural mechanisms and project performance. It examines the PPP arrangements in 13 large-scale road projects across India from 2000 to 2010. The study found that there was no direct relationship with the governance arrangements and their influence on project success; rather, the success of PPP projects depended on the quality of the contracts, project design, and government commitment and oversight. In addition, it found a relationship that is not expected with governance structure and contract structure, namely, that PPP infrastructure contracts are generally more complex and more expensive than non-PPPs. As such, government intervention and control over PPP contracts and projects are required and are the key to success in PPP): 4 ()\\nPages: 549-566:4\",\"Electric vehicles charging in India: Infrastructure planning and policy aspects (Part III)\\nThis is the third article in a series.

This paper investigates the role that games might have in strengthening institutional frameworks in this context, by designing experimental games to assess the impact of a range of institutional measures. We test the effects of different types of water governance on the performance of common infrastructures by conducting an experiment in 10 rural water and sanitation schemes. The experimental design allows us to estimate the effect of governance types on a variety of measures such as water availability, cost, quality and quantity of service. Our results suggest that, when water is managed by a self-help group, water supply and service quality are better, while cost and water quantity are worse. When water management is through a panchayat, service quantity, supply costs and quality of services\",\"Medical oncology in India: workload, infrastructure, and delivery of care in three hospitals\\nAbstract\\nBackground: In India, cancer is the second most common cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for 6.0% of the global disease burden.

The urban population living more than one kilometer away from public transport, public health, education, and water supply facilities is significantly higher in the larger cities. Further, we find an increase, rather than decrease, in inequality in service delivery across districts. Our results provide empirical support for the argument that local governments should be allowed to expand and provide more services to the population of their jurisdiction in a more decentralized and devolved environment, thereby reducing inequality.\",\"Innovative civic engagement and digital urban infrastructure: Lessons from 100 smart cities mission in India\\nDate2016-10-13\\nAuthor\\nMandal, S\\nGhosh, A\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nSmart city mission is an ambitious plan to transform Indian cities by using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and other digital technologies to improve city services.

The impact has been estimated through the simulation of alternative scenarios of future road infrastructure. We use the model to explore the impacts of increasing road investments on growth, employment, productivity, and energy consumption. Our findings suggest that improving road quality is crucial, especially for improving transport efficiency. This implies that investments in roads need to be made with more consideration paid to the quality-adjusted costs and benefits of investments. Moreover, the positive link between infrastructure investments and GDP indicates the importance of investing in new transport systems.

The financial health assessment of the projects can be conducted by using a number of methods, some of them are: traditional debt to equity ratio, debt coverage ratio, interest coverage, return on equity, and profitability ratio etc. However, all these methods have their own shortcomings. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive model is developed based on the stochastic simulation technique to assess the financial risks of a highway project. An example model of an investment based highway PPP project is used to analyse the effectiveness of this model by simulating the project for a period of fifteen years. Simulation results suggest that the developed model can help to predict and understand the various parameters that affect the overall performance of financial aspects of any highway based\",\"Financing India's urban infrastructure: Current practices and reform options -- World Bank\\nIndia' s Urban Development Sector\\n- In India urban areas are home to 31% of the total population and to over 55% and 75%of the economically active population in manufacturing and services, respectively. The sector has grown rapidly in the decade of nineties; in 2000, urban population was 340 million, or 21% (World Bank 1998).\\nUrban Infrastructure\\nA major challenge for governments of developing countries is to expand the capacity and quality of their cities' infrastructure. This requires large capital investments in transport and other infrastructure services.\\nIn India, the need for urban development has intensified in recent years, in particular in large metropolitan areas, as the rapid growth of its economy has resulted in rising demand for housing, transportation infrastructure, water supply and sanitation, and basic social services. In order to meet this demand and provide basic services to their\",\"The competitive effects of transmission infrastructure in the indian electricity market\\nThe authors examine the effects on competition in Indian electricity markets when transmission investment is increased, and the implications for efficiency and welfare when the transmission cost of generation and load is unbundled. They find that unbundleing transmission increases efficiency but reduces welfare, especially in regions with high-voltage transmission, where the cost advantage of load-serving entities over independent power producers in accessing the system is large. The authors find a significant welfare gain to unbinding if the unbonding cost is 1% of total cost, with gains to load from a lower cost system and to generators from access to new customers.\",\"Impact of transportation infrastructure on development in East Africa and the Indian Ocean region\\nInfrastructure development for transport has been a major driver of economic growth and poverty reduction.

However, the adoption of EVs faces a significant challenge in terms of the absence of an EV ecosystem. This study evaluates the viability of EV charging stations and assesses the performance of 10 charging companies operating in three different regions. The study finds that 3 out of every 4 charging facilities do not break even. It suggests that companies have to focus on reducing operational and infrastructure capex costs to reduce their charging cost and improve profitability.\\nThe study also found that charging facility capitals are highly concentrated and the market is dominated by a few companies, indicating a potential for consolidation in future.\",\"Financing infrastructure projects in India will become easier as the government will now allow 100 percent foreign direct investment (FDI) in road construction, a senior official said.\\n\\u201cThe Cabinet has given its nod to increase the sector\\u2019s FDI limit to 74 percent from the existing 49 percent, as announced in the Budget.

Critical infrastructures are an integral and essential part of the national and global information and communication (IC) infrastructures. They are the life-support systems of our nation, without which our economy and social life can be crippled or stopped. These include power generation, telecommunications, transportation, health care, food and agriculture, law enforcement, financial institutions, etc. In the United States, critical national infrastructure was defined in 198\",\"Removing poverty and inequality in India: the role of infrastructure\\nAbstract:The infrastructure development in rural India is an issue of great concern. The rural population is still facing a number of problems that include poor roads, lack of water supply, inadequate drainage systems and poor health services. In the present paper, we try to identify the impact of rural infrastructure on the level of poverty in villages. We estimate the relationship between the infrastructure and the income of families in 50 selected villages of Uttar Pradesh. Our findings suggest that rural households in these villages spend more time on income generating activities due to better road connectivity and improved health facilities.\\nKeywords: Infrastructure; Income; Poverty in Rural India; Village level analysis\\nDocument Type: Research Article\\nDOI:\\nAffiliations: 1: Department of Rural Development, Institute of Social Studies, Post Box No. 11, New Delhi 110 012, India\\nPublication date: April 15, 2013\",\"An empirical investigation of the link between infrastructure development and poverty reduction: The case of India\\nDate2019-05\\nAuthor\\nBajaj, Anjali\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThis dissertation empirically investigates the causal effects of infrastructural development on poverty in India. Using a unique panel data set of 1,000 Indian states, over the period 1993 to 2010, I investigate the effect of various types of infrastructure and their combination with the level of poverty on household consumption and expenditure. I find that infrastructurally developed states have lower poverty rates than the infrastructually underdeveloped states. This suggests that poverty can be reduced by developing infrastructure. Infrastructure, particularly roads, has a significant positive effect on income generation and hence has an impact on the poverty level. The results also indicate that the impact of road infrastructure is stronger than that of irrigation infrastructure in reducing poverty. However, the results show that irrigation and power infrastructures do not have any significant impact. In addition, while there are significant gender differences in the effects,\",\"Health infrastructure and economic development in India \\u2013 a case of Maharashtra\\nAbstract\\nIn the recent years, the health sector has been witnessing a significant growth, especially in the public health services.

Furthermore, it highlights the crucial role that local self-governments play to improve service delivery and financial sustainability of their infrastructure and services.

This study investigates the impact on rural-urban inequality of two different types of infrastructures in rural India during the last two decades. Our main focus is on electricity, irrigation, roads and transport. In rural areas, we find a positive and significant relationship between the number of electrification projects and inequality. A negative and insignificant link with the rural\\u2013urban distribution of irrigation projects was found. On the contrary, road and rail projects were negatively related to inequality at the village level. The main explanation for this is that roads are more likely to benefit the better-connected rural households in more developed states, whereas railways benefit all rural residents, including those who live in less developed areas.\",\"Engineering modernity: Water, electricity and the infrastructure landscapes of Bangalore, India, 1880\\u20131940\\nThe paper argues that the water, electric and gas infrastructure that came to be associated with the modern city of 'Bangalore' (also known as \\\"Bengaluru\\\" and \\\"'Garden City') was in fact the result of a complex process of appropriation and contestation of public and private resources.

In this study, we analyze the time overrun and its various dimensions in 25 mega infrastructural projects. Our analysis is based on a data of 3,200 mega projects undertaken over a period of more than 50 years since 1961. The findings suggest that there is a wide range of delay in infrastructure delivery across various mega-projects and the projects with higher delay also tend to cost more and vice-versa. We found that the cost over-run is directly proportional to the delay. Further, the analysis suggests that project size, project complexity as well as project location and climate are important factors for project cost and time-overrun.\\nNo References\\n No References declared.\",\"Infrastructure and core quality practices in Indian manufacturing organizations: Scale development and validation\\nIn the recent past, the government of India has given top priority to manufacturing sector by launching various policy initiatives. These initiatives are directed towards creating an environment conducive for industrial and technological development as well as for achieving self-reliance in the country. As part of a wider research program, this paper investigates the scale development of the core infrastructure and quality practice of manufacturing companies. The data were obtained from a cross-section of 500 Indian companies belonging to the manufacturing sectors of textile, chemicals and automobile. Data were collected in 2007, 1 year post the launch of National Programme of Technology Initiatives (NPTI) for the development in infrastructure, training, research, innovation and entrepreneurship [Rajan, R. and Kumaraswamy, T., 2013].

The rural households in this study are selected from a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 households that is representative of India's rural population. Banking outreach is defined as the number of branches per 1000 people residing in a district. It is found that a 10% increase in the banking coverage in districts leads to a higher probability of having a formal bank account for the households. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that banking services are complementary. However, the study also reveals a significant impact of branch density on formal savings. These savings are found to be positively correlated with branch densities as well as with banking penetration in rural India.\",\"Divided infrastructure: legal exclusion and water inequality in an urban slum in Mumbai, India\\nDate2014\\nAuthor\\nAbstract\\nThe urban poor face the most acute water poverty in India, with many lacking piped water. In response to this, they have developed a system based on self-supply of water through private wells and cisterns, often located in shared spaces. The study uses ethnography and participatory mapping to examine how the urban water system has been organised and governed through the private sector and by local government, in a poor neighbourhood. Drawing on the theoretical concepts of legal geographies, the study reveals how water infrastructure and the water service are divided between public and private sectors in informal settlements, and how this division is a result of the exclusion of public infrastructure in these communities.\\nDescription\\nCitation : Goggin, S. and Sridharan, K.

This paper examines the impact of the quality of transport infrastructure, and electricity generation capacity on the growth of per capita income in 12 South Asian countries using annual time series data. The paper first estimates the effects of different components of capital stocks on economic growth and then examines how much of these effects can be explained by infrastructure. A structural model is used to identify the relative importance of each component of growth-infrastructure and the other factors such as labour, land, human capital and capital. It is found that the infrastructure stock explains a significant portion of economic performance: on average 22 percent of annual real GDP growth over the last three decades can attributed to infrastructure and 14 percent to the stock of physical capital in the economy. These findings indicate that developing Asian economies can improve their growth performance through better infrastructure development.\\n- R.

However, there has not been a corresponding growth in road networks in urban areas and the existing roads have not seen much maintenance. The construction and maintenance of the roads in a country like India is one of its most significant development issues, but little attention has so far been paid to the impacts of roads on local communities living nearby. In India, many people are affected by road construction projects, and a growing literature shows that the environmental, economic and social impacts are not well managed. This paper examines the issue of environmental injustice from the perspective of those who are directly affected. It analyses the case of a proposed road development in Delhi, India that was to be built in an area with low economic status.

It uses a nationally representative data set on households from India's Rural Household Survey (RHS). The empirical results indicate that households residing in the tropical zone are poorer and have lower access to sanitation, education and improved health facilities as compared to households in other climatic regions. However, the results of the multinomial logit analysis show that the association between the climatic zone and poverty depends, to a large extent, on the nature of household housing - i.e. whether the household is urban'slum' dwelling or rural dwelling. The results suggest that rural \\\"non-slums\\\" and slums are the poorest, and urban dwelling is the richest.

They also charge higher tuition fees and the quality of education appears to be higher. It is also found that the cost structure of private schools makes them vulnerable to fluctuations in their financial inflows. Finally, it is argued here that, despite the higher quality and lower costs of the private sector\",\"The impact of infrastructure provisioning on inequality: Evidence from India\\nThis study investigates how the impact on income inequality of public provision of basic infrastructure (schools, roads, and irrigation) may vary across states in India and between rich and poor households. Using a panel data set, the study analyses the effect of these public interventions on the distribution of income among rural households in a sample of Indian states and among households of different wealth groups over the period 1973\\u20132000. The results show that, although the overall distribution has become more unequal, provision and investment in basic public infrastructure have reduced inequality among rich households, but not among poor ones. Public infrastructure investments have been more beneficial to poor people in states with high levels of per capita income in the pre-reforms era. In contrast, there is no impact at all on poor families in high-performing states.\\n- S. V.

It accounts for nearly 70 percent of the GDP. The government spends a major part of its revenues on Interest payment and Debt servicing. This is because of a very large public debt, which is about 60 percent - 65 percent. Of the 5 percent, 3.6 percent is the share of Debt service.\\nInterest Payment and debt servicing have grown by 4 percent and 8 percent respectively every year. Debt and Interest payments constitute an average of 15 percent share in the total budgetary allocation of all Ministries. 20 percent budget is earmarked for Interest Payment. In 1993, Debt Service and interest payments together accounted for less than 2 percent expenditure. As the economy has grown and the government has increased the amount spent on interest payment\",\"Japan's export of infrastructure systems: pursuing twin goals through developmental means\\nAbstract.\\nAbout the author\\u002fs:\\nNatsuki Kato\\nUniversity of Tokyo\\nJapan\\nProfessor Natsukie KATO was born in Osaka, Japan, in 1956.

This paper examines the ways in which policy making in urban areas has been influenced by, and has influenced, the workings of this institution. The paper begins with an exploration of how policy makers in Delhi, India have attempted to negotiate and co-opt the Bank\\u2019s policies to serve their political agendas and economic priorities. It then turns to the way the institution itself has shaped the policy process in post colonial India, through its influence on the state.

As such, this paper argues that understanding and analysing the complex and often contradictory ways that development finance institutions influence policy is essential if we are to understand the processes\",\"Health infrastructure in rural India is abysmal and a major hindrance in providing quality healthcare to the population.

The transformation of the industrial sector from a labor-intensive one to a capital and technology intensive sector is underway. With this shift, the role of ICT has become important for the growth of industrial efficiency and productivity, and in reducing inefficiencies that arise from the fragmentation of physical infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a two-sector model and examine the effect of infrastructure and ICT on productivity in both the services and manufacturing sectors. Using the data of manufacturing and services sectors for years 1998-2000, for a panel of 30 industrial clusters and a control group of non-industrial clusters, our results show that the productivity growth in manufacturing is positively associated with the development of road and power infrastructure in the manufacturing clusters whereas, in case of services sector, both infrastructure development and use of technology increases the level of productivity.
