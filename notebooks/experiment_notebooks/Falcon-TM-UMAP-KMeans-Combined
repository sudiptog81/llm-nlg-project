Over the past two decades, there has been growing interest in the analysis of climate trends at the global level and at regional scales. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) has an important influence in modifying the climate of the subcontinent. Climate variability is characterized by decadal scale variability. This paper reviews the existing studies of decennial climate change for the period 1900\\u20132000 and the first decade of 21st century, which are based on a variety of sources of data, including the gridded climate data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction - National Centers for Climate Prediction, USA, the Indian Meteorolgical Department \\u2013 Indian Climate Analysis Research Program, and other data sources.

The hybrid air system is composed of a solar collector and a vacuum insulated tube collector. Solar collector was designed and manufactured using parabolic trough concentrator, which consists of 2 parabolae and 5 reflectors. Vacuum insulated air tube was manufactured by vacuum insulation technology, and the collector has 1.2 m internal diameter and length of over 30 m. A detailed mathematical and physical analysis is conducted for the solar collectors. In the life analysis, all parameters are estimated from a literature search and from manufacturer data. Thermal and electrical energy requirements for heating air and pumping hot air into the tubes are considered. Heat transfer coefficient, air density, temperature difference and tube wall temperature of the air are determined from literature data for different conditions of Indian climate. It was found that solar air heating has a maximum coefficient\",\"Assessing the vulnerability of socio-environmental systems to climate change along an altitude gradient in the Indian Himalayas\\n-\\nPublication Date2014\\nPublisher\\nAbstractThe Indian Himalayan region is the most sensitive region in terms of climate and environmental changes. A better understanding of the potential impacts of these changes on socio environmental systems in this region would enable the development of appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The present study assesses the vulnerabilities of different socioenvironmentally important systems along a height gradient to the climate changes in Himachal Pradesh. For this purpose, the spatial distributions of temperature, precipitation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were extracted from 20km resolution MODIS satellite images for the period 2001\\u20132010. These were then used to generate monthly and yearly maps for temperature and precipitation for four different altitudinal ranges. In addition to this, for two locations in different climatic conditions (\\u003c 1500 m and \\u003e 4000m), the NDVI values were calculated by using Landsat TM images at a spatial resolution of 30 m.

As the death toll increased with the passage of time, media coverage of the disaster increased and it became clear that the deaths were largely attributable to the effects of extreme heat and not of any other cause. A heatwave, which is a period of unusually high temperatures, has been associated in some studies with mortality, but the causal relationship is not fully understood. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the national weather forecasting agency has now published an analysis of a heat-death cluster that occurred during a 10-day period in mid-April 2106. This heat cluster was found to have been linked to climate and the IMD has also linked the cluster to extreme climate. They have published a special bulletin in their bulletin series which provides a comprehensive summary.\\nThe cluster of deaths occurred in\",\"Impact of climate change on forests in India\\nThe Indian climate is very diverse, from the tropical monsoonal forests of the Eastern Ghats to the snow-clad mountain ranges.\\nThese forests are also highly sensitive to climate variability and climate extremes.

Increasingly severe droughts, and the associated heat waves, will threaten forests and forest resources. The forests may also be susceptible to fire, as climate and temperature extremes increase and cause an increase in fire intensity. This could threaten forest ecosystems, the wildlife and human livelihoods that rely on them. It could also increase the spread of invasive and non-native plants and animals.\",\"Future climate change: Implications for Indian summer monsoon and its variability\\nAbstract\\nThe current study examines future climatic trends in the summer Indian monsoons. The study is carried out by using a coupled general circulation model (GCM) with the atmospheric component driven by a 20 year control 1961-80 simulation. Two scenarios of future climate have been considered in this study, the first scenario represents an idealistic scenario and the second represents a realistic scenario. It is observed that in both scenarios the Indian Summer Monsoon will be affected. However, there is considerable difference in their intensity, and their impacts. Under the ideal scenario, both the intensity and frequency of the mon Soons decrease. Whereas, under the realistic scenarios, intensity of summer rainfall is predicted to increase and monSoons will become more frequent and intense. These findings indicate that the changes in summer climate will result in changes to the seasonal mon soons, leading to a significant impact on agriculture, water resources management, energy demand and supply and other human activities in Asia.\\nKey Words\",\"Conflicting signals of climatic change in the Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan: a case for more data!\\n- By:\\n-.\\nAdditional Publication Details\\n-)\\nFull text not available from this repository.\\nCitation\\nKumar, P., Sengupta, R., Khan, M.A., Ahmad, A., Khar, Z.K. and Khanal, D.

As a result, Gujarat\\u2019s population is highly dependent on natural resources, especially on the state\\u2019 s water resources and on agriculture. This study assesses the adaptation strategies of a smallholder farming community in the coastal district of Saurashtra, which are currently being employed to respond to and reduce their vulnerability to a changing climate. Using an integrated social-ecological system perspective, the study examines the adaptive capacity of the community to reduce the vulnerability of smallscale farmers through changes in their livelihoods and in natural resource use. The community is engaged in multiple livelihoods, including farming, fishing, livestock raising, and forest-based activities. Their adaptation responses fall under four broad categories. They\",\"Impact of climate change and other factors on emerging arbovirus diseases and vectorial capacity\\nAbstract\\nEmerging Arbovirus Diseases (EADs): Aedes albopictus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Zika are considered to pose a growing risk to human and animal health worldwide. The increasing number of people moving between regions carrying the pathogens that cause them is likely to increase the spread. Climate change is a major determinant of the transmission of these diseases. This review aims at identifying and assessing the impact of various factors including climate on EADs. A search of peer-reviewed publications from 1964-2013 was undertaken in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation databases using the following key words: climate, vector, arboviruses, disease, dengue, chikengunia. We also searched the literature for the impacts of temperature on mosquito vectors in order to assess the influence of changing climate.

The region is endowed with 12 major biogeographic regions. This study deals with the impacts of climatic changes on Himalayan biodiversity with a special focus on the impact of global warming, and provides an overview on climate and climate related parameters affecting flora and fauna. In the present paper various factors are considered which affect the Himalayan flora-fauna in a bid to predict the effect of changing climatic conditions on this unique ecosystem of biodiversity. It has been found that Himalayan Flora and Fauna are likely to be adversely affected with increase in temperature as the alpine plants are expected to suffer most due to increased temperature, while the lowland plants would be able to survive.

Its circulation is driven by the monsoons, which are the dominant mode of tropical ocean-atmosphere interaction. The monsoon circulation can be strongly modulated by external forcing, for example in response to changes in the atmospheric circulation due to greenhouse warming. In a recent study we have shown that the circulation in model simulations of the twentieth century is modelled realistically, but that there are large deviations from a realistic circulation that occur on multiyear to centennial time scale, and can only be explained by a non-\",\"Soil moisture droughts under the retrospective and projected climate in India\\nAbstract\\nClimate variability, including drought events, is expected to intensify in the future in South Asia, which is home to a fifth of the world population.

The impact on climate variability, which is often considered to be the most critical source of uncertainty for the projections of global mean climate, has attracted considerable attentions. However, the impact, so far, is not well quantified, especially for regional climate. To explore the impacts of mean bias on East Africa, we use the ERA40 Re-Analysis data to investigate the relationship between the mean state bias and the climate variables over East Afica for 1961-1990.

It shows that climate season-time-related knowledge is a complex phenomenon which is influenced by many factors including: cultural context; ecological and meteorological conditions in a particular location, social context and historical factors. The article also explores how time-seasonal knowledge can help us understand the dynamics of the local climate in relation to cultural and ecological changes as well as to climate impacts and risks.

We use an error correction and cointegration methodology to identify the long-term equilibrium relationship for the variables and also to check the existence of a long run relationship. The empirical results indicate that rainfall is a leading indicator of agricultural activity in India. This implies that agricultural development in the country is highly dependent on rainfall variability. Our analysis also indicates that India\\u2019s agricultural economy is not very climate sensitive. In this case, climate is an input for production of food in agriculture rather than being a major factor for determining its productivity.

Using the wave-let analysis, two dominant modes were extracted from the data. From the first mode, the annual cycle is identified; and from second mode the monthly cycle and subannual cycle are identified, and are found to be the dominant oscillators. Then, an autocorrelation analysis was applied to the second harmonic of this oscillator. Finally, a Granger causality test is applied in order to check the causation between two series.

It is observed that the village, which has already experienced severe flooding and other climatic extremes, is highly sensitive to climatic changes, and therefore, has low resilience capacity. The vulnerability of this community is further amplified by its social characteristics such as a high dependence on natural resources, low income level, large household size, female-headed households, poor education levels, high illiteracy rate and low access to information. These factors are considered as drivers for climate-induced displacement and vulnerability. This study also explores the coping capacities of the community, through various livelihood strategies such a shifting cultivation, fishing, livestock rearing, migration and cultivation with the use of chemical fertilizers.

However, there are still some uncertainties about the mode shift from the present-day \\u201cwet mon So, we have developed a simple climate model, which includes both the land and sea. Based on this climate system, a climate change scenario with two climate modes has also been developed using an atmospheric general circulation model. The first climate mode is the existing mode and it is used as a reference scenario. A second climate scenario is simulated for a future period (2011\\u20132055) using the same model with different initial conditions.\\nWe find that the sea level\",\"Climate change contributes to more frequent consecutive positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, which cause heavy rains and floods in Southeast Asia\\nA new study published in Geophysical Research Letters has found that human-induced climate change has contributed to a trend increase in consecutive negative Indian Dipolar events (IDPs) \\u2014 a period of alternating positive and negative dipolar regions of the Indian and Pacific Ocean. Researchers found a strong correlation between the IDPs and the frequency and intensity of consecutive extreme rainy seasons in the Southeast Asian region since the 1990s.\\nConsecutive negative IDP events are linked to extreme rainfall and flooding in this region as they increase the probability of a second extreme IDM following consecutive dry years. These second negative events often occur with a lag of several months, but are often larger than the first ones.. As the region experiences an increased probability for a wet year following a dry period, the number of extreme events is likely to increase. The researchers found\",\"Impact of climate change in Indian horticulture-a review\\nAbstractThis review paper focuses on the effects of various kinds of climatic changes on horticultural crops and the possible strategies available to combat such changes. The climate of India is generally characterized by a wide variability in temperature and precipitation, resulting in wide range of agro-climatic conditions. In addition, the country is also experiencing a rise in temperatures and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. Climate changes, particularly the increase of temperature, have a strong effect on crop development, which in turn affects the crop growth parameters. Climatic changes can influence the productivity of crops by either increasing or decreasing their growth potential. This review also discusses various adaptation strategies such as changing cultivars, changing growing practices, shifting the cropping seasons and developing new crop varieties that can withstand the adverse impacts of changing climate.\\nKeywords: Climate Change; Adaptation; Climatically Induced Stress; India\\nIssue\\nSection\\nOriginal Research\\nAuthors retain the copyright of\",\"Impact of climate change on demands for heating and cooling energy in hospitals: An in-depth case study of six islands located in the Indian Ocean region\\nImpacto del cambio clim\\u00e1tico en la demanda por calefacci\\u00f3n y refrigera\\u00e7\\u00e3o en hospitales: una exploraci\\u00f3nes in de profundidad de seis islas ubicadas en el mar Indiano region.\\n- Source:\\n-.\\nAbstract\\nA detailed case-study of the impact of Climate Change (CC) on the energy demands of hospitals located on islands is presented.

This is done by applying a stochastic simulation technique to estimate the yields and yields variability of major crops in India under current climate and projected climate scenarios. We find that a significant reduction in mean and range of crop yield is possible by the end of this century, due to climate warming in the future. However, the magnitude of impact depends strongly on the climate model used for projection. The impacts vary from crop, region, climate scenario, and model. For example, for wheat, yield decrease due temperature increase is highest in models with high temperature sensitivity, while it is very low in other models. Further, temperature and yield\",\"Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries.

This study explores how the media in each of these languages presents the issue of global climate in a manner that reflects the cultural and ideological background of each nation. The analysis reveals significant differences between the way these issues are addressed and framed in these three languages. While English has the least amount of coverage, this is due in large part to the fact that this coverage is often in specialized magazines. In addition, there are significant discrepancies in how climate is framed and discussed in Hindi and English. Finally, a comparison of how issues such as climate are discussed across all three newspapers reveals that Malayali newspapers are more likely to discuss the political dimensions of this issue than the Hindi or English newspapers.\\nKeywords\\nGlobal warming; Media; English; Malay; Hindi;\",\"Predicting the geographical distribution of an invasive species (Chromolaena odorata L.

Chromolaenia odorate is a non-native tree introduced to the region as a commercial timber source. It is now a major threat to forests and agricultural fields of South and Southeast Asia and has the potential to cause major economic losses in these regions. To determine the current and future range of the invasive tree under the scenario of projected temperature and precipitation changes, a GIS-based approach has been used to predict the future geographical range.

The ITF has strong interannual variability - both in terms of the magnitude of heat flux through it and in its strength and spatial pattern. The strength of ITFs varies on decadal timescales, and the interdecadal oscillation of strength, which has been termed the Indo-Pacific inter-decal variability, is thought to be due to variations in Indian and Pacific basin sea surface temperature forcing (). The magnitude and direction of ocean-atmosphere heat coupling associated with the variability of these basin-scale heat transports have important consequences for climate change and variability.

It is based on secondary analysis and draws from a comprehensive set of studies on agricultural impacts. We present evidence suggesting that, due to the increasing severity of water deficits, the production of major food crops (cereals, rice, wheat and pulses) will decrease significantly in the near future. The most vulnerable crops to climate variations seem to be rice and wheat. A decline in rice yields may reach up to 40% by 2075 due primarily to water scarcity, although climate variability is expected to increase. Wheat production may decline by up 30% over the same period. Our analysis reveals a strong association between temperature and crop yield variability, as well as between water deficit and yield variation.\",\"India s national action plan on climate change\\n- Author:Tina\\n2017-07-11 15:59:07\\nIndian Minister of Environment and Forest Prakash Javadekar recently presented the National Action Plan on Climate Change 2010-2030 at a press conference in New Delhi on 11th July.\\nThe action plans aims to reduce the emission of green house gases to 2 per cent of 1990 levels by year 2020 and to achieve the same level of emission in year- 2050.

During the heat-wave event from June to July in this year, high temperature was observed in East Asian countries. A high rainfall event was also observed over Japan during the same period.\\nWe examined the association between extreme conditions and large-scale circulation using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model.

It is also the most important natural fiber for textile and clothing in China, India, and many other developing countries. Climate change and variability are likely to influence cotton productivity in these regions in future. The objective of this study is to simulate the potential impacts on the production of cotton, based on a global gridded data set of temperature and precipitation, which was developed as part of a previous project. For this purpose, the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the Noah-MP land surface model were used.

This is expected to affect the river flows which in turn could affect hydropowering. To estimate the projected change in the power output, this study has used a global hydrological model and a hydrotechnical model. Projection of rainfall under various climate scenarios has been done using two climate models, HadRM3.1 and HadCM3, with the period of 1950\\u20132035. The hydrologic model is used to simulate streamflow using the calibrated parameters for the selected sub-catchment, which is considered as a reference catchment for comparison.

The BoB samples show that the magnetic field of magnetite is of a lower strength than is that observed in similar sedi-ment in South China Sea. This is due to the fact that sedimental magnetites have formed under the influence of different magnetic and environmental field conditions. However, the magnetitic mineralogy, as determined with x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, show similarities in both sedimen and magnetism. A significant feature in this study is the detection of magnetic mineral particles with diameters smaller than 2 \\u00b5m and their magnetic properties. These particles are probably produced by chemical weathering of pyroxenoids and olivines in sediment from a source area. Sedimental magnetic measurements are compared with the\",\"Assessing reliability of regional climate projections: the case of Indian monsoon\\nAbstract\\nThe study investigates the reliability and consistency of climate simulations over the Indian summer monsoonal region using different climate models and downscaling techniques. The reliability is evaluated for the summer of 2006 and 2010 over two regions: India (30oN\\u201330\\u00b0N, 60oE\\u201390o E) and the North Atlantic Ocean (\\u003e10o N,\\u003e90\\u00b0 E), using the Standard Observation Network \\u002f ERA-Interim 0.5\\u00b0 gridded data.

The Himalayan region is projected to be one of the most vulnerable regions, and cities are likely to bear the brunt of extreme climate events. This paper seeks to contribute to understanding of adaptation processes in Himalayan urban environments. Households living in two informal settlements in Shimla were studied to understand their adaptation strategies, decisionmaking processes, vulnerability and coping capacities. A mixed-methods approach was used to elicit information through a semi-structured questionnaire, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a household survey. Results indicate that adaptation to climate hazards is not yet well understood, though some households have been able to identify and implement adaptation responses. Vulnerability and capacity analyses were conducted to assess the vulnerability to and the coping capacity of households and community groups. These analyses indicated that the capacity for households to cope with climate-change impacts is affected by gender, education level, income level and household size.\\nDownloads\\nReferences\\n\",\"impact of climate change on the indian economy: evidence from food grain yields.\\n- Sushil Kumar & Rattan Lal, 2004. \\\"Agricultural Productivity, Climate Variability and Food Security in the Developing World,\\\" Journal of Applied Economics, Universidad del CEMA, vol. zero, pages 1-21. full text for ScienceDirect Subscribers only.\",\"Assessment of future climate change impacts on water resources of Upper Sind River Basin, India using SWAT model, (2016)\\nIssue : 11 | June 2019 \\u00bb\\nPages 1 to 3 \\u002f 7 total\\n- #Water & Wastes Digest India\\nIndia\\u2019s Water 2020\\nJune 28,2010, New Delhi \\u2013 The 4th National Water Conference and Exhibition will see India\\u2019 s water and sanitation sector coming together in New De\",\"The unequal effects of weather and climate change: Evidence from mortality in India\\nAbstractThis paper estimates the effects that extreme weather events and temperature changes have on life expectancy at birth in rural villages in northern India using microdata on mortality collected in the National Sample Survey from 1977 to 2006. The results suggest that the mortality impact of heat waves is larger than that of droughts. This result holds for both the rural and urban villages. However, mortality from floods has a larger impact than does drought on the urban sample. A larger share of the increase in total population in villages is in low-rainfall areas during extreme events than during drought. In general, the impact on rural villagers is much larger for high temperatures than for drought, and for floods than drought; and vice versa for urban villagers. For rural areas, heat wave mortality impacts are larger in states with high levels of population density. Flood mortality increases faster in areas with higher population densities.): 8 (\",\"India as an emerging power in international climate negotiations\\nA recent paper by the Indian School of Business and the Institute of Social and Economic Change, \\u201cThe Emerging India in Climate Negotiations 2011\\u201d, explores the evolution of India\\u2019s approach to climate change negotiations, from 1992 to 2009 and (to date) \\u2013 2022.

Climate change and its impact on water resource availability has been a cause of concern across the world. There are several reports on the impact of climate change at global, regional and local scales. However, in India the assessment and monitoring of impact at local scale is not very common, except in certain regions like the Himalayas where water is already in shortage, and in some coastal areas where sea level rise and cyclones have been impacting the water availability. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology and approach that can assess the effect of climatic change on different water sources like surface water, groundwater, etc. In this chapter an attempt is made to develop an approach, methodology, tools and indicators to assess and monitor the climate impact and associated changes on surface and groundwater resources.

The findings of this review suggest that India has become increasingly engaged in the climate regime, both by contributing to global climate efforts and by drawing on international climate knowledge to inform its domestic climate policies. India remains, however, a highly vulnerable country which will continue to face significant challenges in adapting to the effects of climate variability and change. In order to address these challenges, the paper argues for a stronger focus on developing and deploying climate-resilient agricultural policies and technologies, as well as on enhancing India's climate monitoring capacity, including through regional cooperation.

The mon soons have a direct impact on agriculture through the distribution of nutrients from the ocean to the land, but also through floods, erosion, or waterlogging. Monsoons are a key component of climate change. As the climate changes, monosons may become more common while the length of the dry season becomes longer. This would have an impact in agriculture, as the duration of rice production in southern India is already 5 months.

The IACC is a tool which combines economic, ecological and social science analysis to provide an understanding of climate and the impacts of various mitigation and adaptation policies to climate. As a relatively new method, the IAAc is increasingly being used and promoted in countries such as India to address climate policy. However, little has been done to understand this approach and its relevance in the South to help bridge the North-South divide in climate governance.

The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of future climate scenarios on food production in different agroecological regions of India, and to explore the vulnerability of different crops to climate variation and change. In addition, the thesis also explores the implications of various climate mitigation strategies in order to assess their potential to mitigate the negative impacts on crop productivity caused by climate variability and the climate changes. A literature review of existing scientific research on the issue is conducted, to identify the major issues associated with climate impact and its mitigation, based on which the research questions are formulated. Based on a detailed literature survey, various models of agricultural impact assessments are developed, which are used to conduct an exploratory study of how climate is expected to impact various crops, with respect to the climatic conditions of Indian agroclimatic zones.

The extent to which these impacts occur, however, will depend on the exposure of vulnerable coastal communities. A major challenge is the lack of information regarding the relative impacts, and thus relative vulnerability, on a spatial scale for many coastal nations. We develop a method to map the extent and relative magnitude of the potential impacts for coastal settlements in India, based on their exposure and sensitivity to the combined effects of sea level rise, storms, drought, extreme temperatures and flooding. These are the same variables used in our earlier work to estimate global-scale relative risks to coastal infrastructure and settlements. To map these variables, we use gridded global climate data from the NASA Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase III. For a sample of coastal Indian settlements we then estimate seaward and landward displacement probabilities under climate\",\"Evaluation of cooling potential of passive strategies using bioclimatic approach for different Indian climatic zones\\nSrinivasan A.,Tirumalai College of Arts & Science For Women |\\nBaskar G.,VIT University Chennai - India\\nRenewable Energy 2014, 73, Article number 1092\\nABSTRACT\\nThis article evaluates the cooling performance potential in Indian climates using the bioclimate concept.

I. Evaluation of impact assessment models using remote sensing data.\\nAbstract\\nRice cultivation in India covers 10 million hectares and provides food for 150 million people. The rice yield is strongly related to climate change. This study estimates the impact of climate variability and change on rice production in six agroecological zones of the Indian states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Assam. We use the 1980s-based National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting climate data and the MODIS 3-monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from June 2000 to May 2010. For this time period, we use a set of remote-sensing- and weather-model-driven methods to estimate and compare the effect of temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. Our estimates show that rice is highly affected by the temperature increase. In addition, a decrease in precipitation is likely to have a major impact in Maharashtra; the\",\"Climate adjustments over Africa accompanying the Indian monsoon onset\\nAbstract.\\nThe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a natural oscillating pattern of the Atlantic Ocean.

In this contribution, I show that this high variability can be explained by two different mechanisms: First, the annual monsoon circulation has been affected by the western branch of South Asian monsoons which have a more pronounced influence in this region because of their origin in Western Tropical Pacific, where the sea surface temperature and the monoswell amplitude are the highest in that region. The second mechanism is due to the interaction of this westerlies with the South India low, which is located in a narrow band in northern India. It is found that during the winter monomonsol, this interaction creates a region of high pressure in peninuslar India, called the Peninsulat India high,\",\"Impact of climate change on Indian agriculture & its mitigating priorities\\nDr. P.K.

Understanding how forests respond and adapt to different environmental conditions is a crucial aspect of conservation and sustainable use of forests. The objective of this study is to evaluate the suitability of forest dynamics models to predict how the forests would respond to changes in climatic variables over the Indian region using observed data. We developed and validated a dynamic forest model using a set of 14 dynamic and structural parameters. Our analysis revealed that the performance of all the models improved when the model parameters were updated with new and improved data, especially when data of recent decades\",\"Analysis of perception and adaptability strategies of the farmers to climate change in Odisha, India\\n-\\nAbstract. A total of 200 farmers were randomly selected to assess climate perception, climate adaptation strategy, and climate coping mechanisms. The results showed that the majority of respondents (85%) had noticed the climate changes. Farmers perceived the current climate as \\u2018normal\\u2019. They were able to perceive the impact of climate-related events and their adaptation strategies. They adapted to the changing climate and adopted several climate protection measures.\\nThe results of this study can contribute to better adaptation to changing climatic conditions in the region, including increased crop diversity and the cultivation of new crop varieties. It is also possible to develop new climate risk insurance schemes, improve irrigation, increase crop yields, protect livestock, develop drought- and heat-resistant crops, as well as the development of more drought and flood-resilient crops.\",\"Indian summer monsoon precipitation climatology in a high-resolution regional climate model: Impacts of convective parameterization on systematic biases and climate variability in China\\n- 1State Key Laboratory on Cryospheric Science, CASIA, Beijing, China (mengjf@mail.cau.edu.cn)\\nThe summer Indian monsoonal precipitation system in northern China is characterized by a strong southward extension of the subtropical jet, with a maximum in convections in the warm sector during June\\u2013August [Wu et al., J.

The Indian Bengal Delta is a densely populated delta region which is highly vulnerable to flooding due to its low geographical position, high precipitation and tidal range. To assess flood vulnerability the IPC framework was extended to cover climate-related floods and sea level rise in combination with socio-economic information. Based on this, the delta is classified as vulnerable. Flood protection measures in this delta are considered inadequate for the present level of flooding. This delta has a high risk of climate related floods, which has increased in recent years.\",\"A study of climate and weather variability over the tropical southwest Indian Ocean during the period 1979\\u20132006\\n- 1Department of Geography, University of Pretoria, Pretori, 0001 South Africa\\nReceived: 27 October 2010\\nAccepted:\\nThe aim of this study was to explore and analyse climatic and meteorological changes in the Indian sector of the western Indian ocean during 1985-2008.

A literature search was conducted using PubMed. Studies with the key word \\u2018climate change\\u2019 were included. We also included reviews of impact of different climate related events that had occurred in past. Most studies on climate-related impacts on human health had been carried out in temperate regions. These studies indicated that climate variability and climate extremes have the potential to affect the burden of several communicable and non-communicable diseases. It was found that the health burden due climate variations is likely to be greater among the vulnerable people, the poor, elderly and women. There were also reports of changes in some non communiable\",\"Implications of climate change for sustainable water resources management in India\\nAbstract\\nThe Indian subcontinent is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate and climate-related hazards, including floods, droughts, landslides and heat waves. These hazards threaten the lives of millions of people, damage agricultural and forest resources, and cause billions of dollars in economic losses. Climate change, the increase in global temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions, will further aggravate the impact of these hazards. This is why the Indian Government has taken climate vulnerability assessments seriously, in order to inform policy development and to identify areas in need of adaptation action. In this paper, we examine what the results of such assessments might mean for managing water and other natural resources in a country like India. We find that the impacts of floods and drought are likely to increase as global warming continues, while the effects of heatwaves are projected to diminish. The effects on agriculture are also likely be severe,\",\"Physical and cooking characteristics of two cowpea cultivars grown in temperate Indian climate\\nBy: Dubey, K.K. ; Kumar, P.\\nContributor(s): Sharma, A.N.S.M.D.V.C.R.G.P.I.T.O [Editor] | Khandelwal, R.L.B.F.A.E.H : 10.1002\\u002fpsc.1401 (1994) Vol.-14 No.-2\\nSubject(thesaurus): Indian cooking, Cowpeas - Physiological effect\\nSeries\\u002fNumber: IFIS\\u002f2008\\u002fP\\u002fECONOMIC, 1\\nPublisher: Springer Netherlands\\nEditor:\\nYear: n.d\\nDescription: Vol.14, No.2, pp.101-106\\nType of document: Journal article\\nLanguage: English\",\"Energy infrastructure in India: Profile and risks under climate change.\",\"physiological research of defence interest in india part ii: studies in thermal stress noise exposure hazards bioclimatology physical work capacity and effects of - 1 thermal heat stress and its physiological effects on defence personnel the thermal environment of indian soldiers is a mixture of high temperature and high humidity which is the cause of the most common heat strain diseases in the tropics and subtropics the physiological responses of humans to thermal environments vary from individual to individual but the effects can be classified into three distinct groups, human health research institute university of toronto -, the health of indigenous peoples world health organization -.\",\"Possible impacts of Indian Ocean dipole mode events on global climate variability: A review\\nThe Indian\\u2013Ocean Dipole is a natural phenomenon occurring in the Indian and Pacific oceans and its impacts on tropical climate and weather have been the subject of much scrutiny.

The data set was constructed to capture farmers\\u2019 perceptions of temperature, rainfall patterns, crop performance, farm management, fertilizer use, pesticide use and knowledge about climate. In a first step, the data were used to construct a set of variables that captured farmers' knowledge and perceptions about changing temperature and precipitation. Then, these variables were combined to create measures of passive climate adaptation that we use as explanatory variables in a second step. Our results suggest that farmers are actively adjusting their agricultural practices to adapt to higher temperatures. However, they are passive when it comes to changing their knowledge. We argue that the reason for this may be that they do not have enough scientific and technical knowledge to be\",\"Increased flood risk in Indian sub-continent under the warming climate\\nThe paper \\\"Flooding in the Indian Subcontinet and its linkages to climate change\\\" has been accepted for publication in Global and Planetary Change.\\nFluvioglacial flooding in South Asia is of particular interest to the authors since their home country, Pakistan, is one of the most flood-prone countries in this area of high-endemicity.

These two types offorcing can be either directly derived from the insolaion or can indirectly arise by changes in the atmospheric heat content and moisture budget caused by the solar irradiation. A recent paper has shown by using a simple coupled model that the orbital insolareforcing, in combination with the tropical sea surface temperature forcing, can lead to a global change ofthe precipitation over the tropics, which is a result of changes induced by both meridianallocation and changes of atmospheric water content. In this paper, the authors aim to examine the role ofmeridionalliation and atmospheric humidity changes as an insoleroading mechanism\",\"Effects of climate change on rice production in the tropical humid climate of Kerala, India\\nDate2000\\nAuthor\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThis paper reviews the literature on climate and rice.

It also provides an analysis of how climate variability may affect rice cultivation in future. The survey reveals the following. There is a clear increase in rice productivity during the period 1959-1979. During the same period, there was no significant change in rainfall or mean air temperature over the state of kerala. However, the number of rice cropping seasons increased from 2.5 in 1980s to 3.25 in early 1990 s. In contrast, it was noted that the rainfall pattern and temperature have changed in keralam.

The glass industry in India has come up with some new technologies in manufacturing glass, such as insulating glass to reduce heat transfer, low iron and low E glass for solar control etc.\\nWith a wide spectrum of glass options available, it is essential to select appropriate glass in order to achieve the desired performance for the application. In order for a particular glass option to perform optimally, its energy efficiency, thermal performance should be taken into consideration. Thermal performance of a building is one of the essential factors for achieving energy saving and sustainable building, and hence energy ratings is given by the government of India. This study aims to review the various energy rating systems for different kinds of glazing, glass types, thicknesses and spacings. It also includes\",\"Long-term trend analysis of climate variables for arid and semi-arid regions of an Indian State Rajasthan\\nA time series analysis has been conducted for the meteorological variables, which are representative of the climate of a particular region and the analysis is carried out for 30 years from 1961 to 1990. The results indicate that the temperature has increased by 0\\u00b75\\u00b0 C. during the period of 60 years. This increase may be due to urbanization and industrialization, as well as the increasing anthropogenic activity. It is also found that rainfall has decreased during this period. Rainfall has declined by about 10 % from the 1950s to the late 1980's in this region.\",\"The Southern Oscillation in surface circulation and climate over the tropical Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, and Indian Oceans as captured by cluster analysis\\nThe southern oscillation (El Ni\\u00f1o\\u2013Southern Oscilation) is a phenomenon of global significance, with impacts on climate as well as fisheries, agriculture, tourism, shipping, air quality, etc. The oceanic circulation is one of the principal drivers for climate variability in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, the most important being the trade winds and associated currents. In this study, a method of analysis by means of multivariate clustering was used to assess the impact of this phenomenon on surface-water circulation in all the three ocean basins in question. This method is based on the assumption that the circulation of water parcels in space is characterized by an intrinsic pattern or \\u201csignature\\u201d that can be quantified and used as a basis for clustering. For this purpose the authors used the ocean surface current vector from the NOAA Global Circulation Model.

The country is prone to floods, cyclones, drought, landslides, earthquakes, and epidemics. In the recent past, the country has been hit by severe climate disasters like cyclone Aila (2009), cyclonic storm Fani 2019 and the earthquake in Jammu and Kashmir in 2005. This paper focuses on the perceptions, awareness, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, practices and perceptions of the community towards climate variability, climate hazards and climate predictions with respect to agriculture. It examines the role of indigenous cultural values in adaptation to climate and disasters in rural communities. For understanding the issues around climate prediction, 20 households from three villages were interviewed using semi structured questionnaires. Findings indicate that most people had a good knowledge regarding the causes of various climate events. However, a majority of them did not believe that climatic changes would affect their agriculture in future\",\"Fluvial response to Late Quaternary climate changes, western India: Implications for river flood and sediment dynamics, 2011\\nCitations\\nAltmetric\\nAuthorMukul, S.; Kumar, A.; Goward, K.; Singh, B.; Chatterjee, T.; Srivastava, D.K.\\nDate2015\\nSource TitleQuaternrary Science Reviews\\nPublisherElsevier\\nUniversity of Melbourne Author\\u002fsKumar, Alok\\nAffiliationSchool of Earth Sciences\\nDocument TypeJournal Article\\nAccess StatusOpen Access\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstractThis paper presents a synthesis of fluvial geomorphic, sedimentological and paleohydrological data from the western Indus and Ganges\\u2013Brahmaputra river basins for the last 10,000 years from a number of sites in the Indian subcontinent.

The results suggest that summer rainfall in Saudi Arabia varies strongly with Indian summer monsoon, as shown by the strong positive correlation between Indian Ni\\u00f1o3.4 SST and summer precipitation in the western Arabian peninsula. During El Ni\\u00d1o years, the monsoonal precipitation is enhanced with the largest values in El-Ni\\u00f1o summer (July and August) over the Arabian Gulf and the southern Red Sea. In contrast, during La-Ni\\u00d1a years the precipitation during summer is decreased with maximum values during the northern winter months. Summer rainfall variability over Saudi is found to be mainly determined by a strong relationship between the NINO 3-2 SSTA with summer temperature at surface layer in Arabian Sea and with precipitation over western peninsula during Nino-3 years.

The passive adaptive capacity among the Indian rural populations has been found to be relatively higher than the global average. However the passive capacity is found relatively low among those in the rural poor and vulnerable group. This implies that the vulnerable populations may face more severe impacts of climate shocks due to their relatively less ability to deal with climate variability. It is observed that rural households which are vulnerable, are more passive in their coping and adaptation strategies and the coping ability declines with increasing vulnerability. A higher passive coping capacity of Indian poor is attributed to greater household savings and access to social safety net.\",\"Trends in seasonal precipitation extremesAn indicator of 'climate change'in Kerala, India\\nThe Indian summer monsoon is considered one of the most important natural climate variables in India, influencing the distribution and intensity of rainfall as well as the water balance of various parts of south Asia.

(2014)\\nAbstract\\nWe assess the sensitivity of winter wheat yields in the Indian monsoon to past variations in temperature, precipitation and radiation in a historical climatology over India 1871-2011. We find that wheat has been more sensitive to temperature than moisture over the majority of the country, particularly in south-western regions. The sensitivity to moisture has become more important in recent years, with precipitation becoming the main driver of yields. Over the north-east wheat production is more influenced by precipitation, whereas over southwestern India the most important factor is temperature. In the future, we find a decrease for the wheat yield in all regions, and this decline is particularly large for south west India, where wheat is currently most vulnerable to climate change.\",\"co2 emissions structure of indian economy\\nThe Indian economy is the tenth-largest in the world in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) and is estimated to be the seventh-most populous country in 2020.

Climate models of global scale are able to simulate the large scale patterns and dynamics of oceanic circulation but have been found to overestimate the strength of Indian and Atlantic Oceans (AO) Walker circulations. It is proposed here that these errors are due to the inability of model to properly represent the strong winds that form the surface boundary layer in the subtropical gyres and are crucial for the ocean to be a strong heat engine. This is supported by a direct comparison between the wind speed and sea surface temperature at the 200 hPa level for a range of locations in both hemispheres. The results show that the models simulate strong eastward winds at ~ 1000 hpa and these winds are responsible for transporting water from equatorial and tropical latitudes to lat. 45\\u2218N and higher.

We interpret the data in the context of changes in precipitation and temperature, based on the 18O and 17O records. During the last glacial cycle (~ 20 kyears), the southward expansion of cold air from northern mid-latitudes led to the formation of an ice sheet over northern India. The resulting climate amelioration was followed by a shift in monsoon rainfall to more southern latitudes. This resulted in higher rainfall over the southern ghat region, but with a pronounced shift to earlier and drier monsoons, which were probably related to a change in sea surface temperature - in particular, the warming of tropical waters.\",\"Sheep husbandry under changing climate scenario in India: An overview\\nAbstract\\nThe paper reviews the status of sheep farming in different agro-climatic zones of the country.

Our analyses of satellite imagery have revealed that mangals respond to rising sea-level and climate variability by expanding their range and changing their structure. In addition, we found that the most vulnerable habitats are those that have the least capacity for adaptation. The study provides new insights on the resilience of ecosystems in the face of global climate threats, and is an important step toward the development of more effective policies and practices to ensure sustainable management of these valuable man-made ecosystems.

In the post-1992 global regime, India has been active in promoting the principles of universality, equity, and common but differentiated responsibility, while simultaneously seeking to limit its international commitments on issues which it views as being beyond its domestic policy space. The paper argues that this strategy, which is based on the idea of \\u201cresponsible sovereignty\\u201d, is in tension with the emerging global institutional architecture for climate policy in its current form.\",\"Climate change and its impact on tropical montane ecosystems in southern India: a synthesis of recent evidence\\nAbstract\\nA major concern of the international community is the impact of climate change on biodiversity, especially in the tropics where many species have narrow endemism ranges. The Himalayas, the Western Ghats, and the Nilgiris are the only mountain ranges in South Asia and together form the Southern Western Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspots. Here, we assess the vulnerability and conservation significance of these montanes with the aim of identifying conservation priorities in this biodiversity hotspot. We synthesize the most recent climate, land-use, vegetation, species occurrence (both plant and animal) and climate-vegetation data to understand the impacts of current and projected climate scenarios in terms of changes in biodiversity. Using the \\u2018hotspots\\u2019 approach, our analysis identifies three hotspots, each containing a set of endemic biodiversity of high importance. Two hotspots have a high proportion of their area within the protected area network; however, their high biodiversity and endemics have not\",\"Do women on boards influence climate change disclosures to CDP?evidence from large Indian companies\\nThe study analyses the impact of female director presence on the reporting practices on climate related risks, in order to determine whether gender diversity on company board is associated with climate disclosure quality. The sample includes 1,600 companies from the Global 500 index. We employ a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach to examine the effects of having one or two women directors, on CDPR disclosure. Results indicate a reduction in carbon disclosures from companies with a single woman director, compared to those with two woman directors. These findings are consistent with the CDS theory and support the hypothesis that a higher representation of women at the boards may result in higher reporting quality of CDPs.\",\"North Atlantic forcing of tropical Indian Ocean climate\\nThe Atlantic Ocean influences the variability and structure of the tropical atmosphere and climate, but the role of ocean forcing in the evolution of Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) is still uncertain.

The monologue nature of this climate can be explained as the strong influence of solar insolation and atmospheric dynamics on the regional circulation of monoclonal climate. In order to investigate the role of climate change in future monoclone climate, one needs to have a better understanding of its variability and predictability. To understand the climate variability, the model should be able to produce realistic monocal climate and its associated extreme. However, it is difficult to model the monoclimte accurately due to the complex atmospheric flow, land-atmosphere interactions, and strong coupling of atmospheric and land surface parameters. Therefore, to predict the future climate under climate changes, an understanding and simulation of natural and anthropogenic variability of Indian Summer Monsoon is a must. This study presents an overview of WRf-ARW model and how\",\"Morphometric analysis of Infra orbital foramen position in South Indian skulls\\nAbstract\\nThe infra orbitalforamenis a rare foramina. In this study we evaluated the infraorbitalforamina of 100 south Indian dry skull specimens. The mean depth of theforamain (MFD) was 8.2mm [range: 5.3mm to 9.8mm]. The infra-orbita foraminal position was observed to be slightly superior in males 0.26mm and slightly inferior in females -0mm. This position offoramin was seen to have a statistical significant relation with the positionof the maxilla. Foramina position showed no significant association with skull length.

The active break spells (ABSs) of the Indian monsoons have an impact on the global climate system through various physical processes. This study uses a multi-model ensemble technique \\u2013 Ensemble Prediction System [1] - to extend the predictability of ABSs for the next five days. An extended range of model forecasts \\u2014 10 days ahead \\u2013, is also analyzed. We first compare the performance of different models, using different predictors in a statistical analysis, to find out which model performs well for this task. Based on this analysis and using the ensemble of models with the highest performance, we develop an extended-range model (~ 3 days) for ABS prediction.\\nThe extended forecast is evaluated against a benchmarking method that uses the NRLMSISE-00 model, and the results indicate that an improved prediction is\",\"Modulation and amplification of climatic changes in the Northern Hemisphere by the Indian summer monsoon during the past 80 ky\\nAbstract\\nWe reconstruct past changes of summer climate (June\\u2013August) over 0.5 degrees of longitude and 30 degrees in longitudes 50\\u201370 degrees N latitude during 70\\u20130 kyr using the stable isotope composition and oxygen composition of a sediment core from the North Atlantic. We demonstrate that the intensity of the summer rainfall over the north-eastern Eurasia and the Arctic Ocean is controlled by climate change on the Asian continent and that this climatic signal is well preserved in sediment isotopes, which are also influenced by regional climate processes. In the last 40 k years, the monsoonal precipitation in north eastern Asia and in Arctic increased during summer, while it decreased in Eurasian high-latitude areas. The decrease of monosonal summer precipitation over Eurasians high latitudes was probably caused by increasing arctic sea ice. This change in mononso\",\"Climate change, sustainable development and India: Global and national concerns\\nThe global concern about climate change has been growing and it is now widely accepted, that it poses an unprecedented challenge to humanity.

A global climate model is forced by the coupled atmospheric model and the ocean component with the Hadley Centre ocean model for a 20-year control simulation and a further 25 years, starting in 2020. The control run represents a climate without any anthropogenic influence. In the future experiment, the model reproduces most of features of current climate including the summer rainfall maximum over South Asia as well as the southwards shift of monolithic summer rain band and its weakening and southward shifting. However, in this future scenario the monolith is replaced with two rain bands. This leads to the weakening of summer precipitation over the western India.\",\"Climate change in context of Indian agricultural sector\\nIndia is the second-largest country in the world with 1,269 million hectares of arable land (ICCA, 2000) and an average land area of 3.5 million sq. km - about 2.3 times larger than that of the United States.

These impacts would be even higher than impacts of droughts. This would lead to a fall in food availability in the Indian sub-continent.\",\"Theoretical energy saving analysis of air conditioning system using heat pipe heat exchanger for Indian climatic zones\\nAbstract\\nThe performance of an Air Conditioning system is directly related to the efficiency of evaporator, condenser and the compressor. The heat rejection of the air-conditioner is done by a fan that drives the indoor air flow rate. It is observed that the heat load of any air conditioner system increases when the ambient temperature of a zone increases. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the theoretical energy efficiency for air cooler using evaporating and condensing heat pipes. This system has the ability to reject heat to any external zone and to absorb heat from any internal zone. A theoretical analysis for the performance and energy savings of heat-pipe based system in a single zone has been presented. In the proposed system, heat transfer is achieved by passing the evaporant (hot plate) to a condensor - which is the cool side of condencer.

The present paper highlights women' vulnerability in India in a context where the impact of changing climate and variability are beginning to be perceived by the policy makers. A literature review shows that the impacts of environmental and climatic change can be expected to increase women\\u2019s vulnerabilities as compared to men in different contexts and regions, but there is little research on this area in Indian context. Women are more vulnerable to water, food, health, shelter and livelihood issues. There are several reasons for this. Some of these are that women are mostly engaged in agricultural production and are involved in household food production as well as in livestock rearing. In rural areas women play a major role in food preparation, storage, processing, marketing and distribution. Their role is much more than that of men. They are also the ones who take care of children and household tasks and\",\"Climate model simulation of the South Indian Ocean Convergence Zone: Mean state and variability\\n- ISSN: 1680-7324\\nAbstract\\nThe mean and extreme states of climate variables, and the variability of these variables in the context of a 100 year hindcast are presented for the period 1900\\u20132007 using an ocean-atmosphere coupled climate model. The mean climatological state of SINDICZ and SITIC is presented and their interdecadal variability is investigated. It is found that there is a large interannual variability in SIN, particularly for summer SST, that is not well described by the model, which is in line with previous studies. SIC exhibits high variability on the decadal time scale. There is evidence to show that SINTIC shows a strong link to the inter-decennial variability and inter annual variability exhibited by SINA, SICA and SI. These findings provide further support for earlier findings that the SIA and ENA are\",\"Climate change, cryosphere and impacts in the Indian Himalayan Region\\nThe Indian Himalayas is a region that is extremely sensitive to climatic variations. The mountain glaciers, the cryospheric components, have been declining in number and area since the beginning of 20th century. This is because of the anthropogenic activities, like deforestation, forest fragmentation, mining, construction and other anthropocene stressors. There is no dearth of literature on the impacts of climate change in Himalayan regions. What is more worrisome is that the glaciers in high altitudes are declining at an alarming rate, causing floods and landslides in lower regions, affecting lives, livelihoods and property. In addition to this, it is also affecting the agriculture of these regions in a negative way due to climate variability and change. Thus there is need for urgent action to save the Himalaya and its cryogenic components.\",\"An adaptive thermal comfort model for the tropical climatic regions of India (Kppen climate type A)\\nAbstract\\nThe purpose of the paper was to develop an adaptive equation for estimating the thermal sensation using a subjective method by a small number of subjects.

The Indian coastline is also no exception. It is well documented that the Indian coastal areas have been witnessing the negative effects of global warming and climate changes over the last few decades. Sea-water temperature has increased and is projected to increase further in future. As a consequence, the intensity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, heatwave, monsoon and drought are projected (IPCC, IPCC Special Report on Managing of Global Warming, SRREN\\u002fIPPC, 2011).\",\"Monsoon-induced biases of climate models over the tropical Indian Ocean\\nAbstract.\\nThe Indian summer monsoon plays a critical role in the climate system of the northern Indian ocean.

The Armed forces are a major consumer of energy and also a large polluter. In order for the armed forces to achieve a carbon-neutral status, there are many challenges that need to be overcome. These include a lack of political will, a poor knowledge base of the Armed force personnel about climate-change and energy-security risks, low levels of awareness and understanding of climate change and related issues among the general population, high levels and costs of fuel consumption, and a limited capacity to innovate and deploy new technology. This thesis provides a review of existing literature on energy efficiency in armed Forces of countries around the world.

In the present paper, the energy analysis of conventional and improved indirect cooling (IC) system was performed. The analysis is performed in the Indian cities of Jaipur and Delhi. For the conventional system, 20 and 30% of energy savings are obtained for winter and summer conditions respectively. It is also found that the improved IC with 50% reduction in water flow rate and with the same evaporating water temperature is more energy efficient than the existing system. Moreover, it is found from the analysis that 15-20% energy reduction may be achieved if the system operates with evaporator temperature of 27\\u00b0C as compared to 32\\u00b0c.\\nKeywords\\nRefbacks\\n- There are currently no refbacks.\",\"Seasonal variations in physio-biochemical profiles of Indian goats in the paradigm of hot and cold climate conditions\\nAbstract\\nIn this study, we have evaluated seasonality of serum, urine and blood parameters in goats reared in a hot (H) and cool-cold - 10oC to 40o (-40.\\nDOI:\\nInt J Appl Res Vet Med Vol. 2(2): 113-122 2015\\nDownloads\\n1087\\n1064\\nCopyright @ 2020 \\u2013 IJAR\\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\",\"tropospheric ozone effect on yield, quality and antioxidant defence of six cultivars of jute with ethylene diurea in the lower gangetic plains of india.\\nAuthor\\nDate1982\\nPermanent Link\\nThesis DisciplineAgronomy\\nDegree GrantorUniversity of Canterbury\\nDepartment\\nCitation\\nDutta, S.

In 2010, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established an official process for the consideration of the impacts of climate on developing nations, including the U.S. The National Tribal Conservation Grants Program ($2.2 million) was established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. As part of this program, this research will examine the relationship between tribal climate adaptation and tribal regulations that protect natural and cultural resources on their reservations. This research project has been designed to address three objectives. First, it will identify tribal natural resource and land use regulatory programs that may protect or enhance climate resilience, as defined by tribal members. Second, tribal regulatory practices will be examined to\",\"Sensitivity of crop cover to climate variability: Insights from two Indian agro-ecoregions\\n- From:\\nAbstract\\nThe Indian agricultural system has been highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This has become even more severe with the increased occurrence of extreme climate events.

A monomodal distribution is typical, with a maximum during the north-east mon-soon, a secondary maximum in the south-west moni-son and a small residual in between. For this reason there are no large interannual variations in rainfall over India. This feature makes it easier to\",\"The once and future pulse of Indian monsoonal climate change\\nAbstract 1,000 years of high-resolution proxy records for the Indian summer monsoon from the Gangetic plains of India.

India\\u2019s vulnerability to climate change is therefore high. In addition, the region is very vulnerable to the effects of climate changes. Climate change affects all sectors of the economy, but agriculture is the most affected and has to adapt in many different ways. This paper discusses the impacts of changing climatic conditions on Indian agricultural yields, crop production and the Indian farmer, with a brief review of past research and a detailed analysis of present and future projections. The analysis shows that the changes in temperature, precipitation, and evaporation are expected to have strong effects on crop yield, water management, pest management and irrigation scheduling. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for adaptation measures, such as improved crop varieties, diversification\",\"Climate models produce skillful predictions of Indian summer monsoon rainfall, but they fail to capture the extreme wet years, such as 2010.\\nThe authors propose a possible way to improve model predictions: by considering the effect of a changing climate on the atmospheric circulation of the Indian monsoons. By adding more heat energy into the atmosphere, a warming planet would tend to intensify the circulation around the pole and weaken it at the equator, where the monosons blow into land masses (in the southern hemisphere, of course). This would cause a stronger poleward flow that would lead to a more intense Indian Monsoon during warm periods and a weaker polewards flow in cold periods, with less rainfall and fewer monson events. The authors tested this hypothesis with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model with and without this effect: the model without the extra heat showed the \\u201cnormal\\u201d monsson patterns. But with the addition of extra energy the climate became more variable, and the\",\"fouling deterrent chemical defence in three muricid gastropod egg masses from the southeast coast of india (2011)\\nFouled egg clutches and egg capsules were collected from three species of murid snails \\u2013 Achatina fulica, Aplastra spp., and Helix aspersa - on the east coast, Andhra Pradesh, India.

The Sundars are also a source of livelihood for the local people who depend on them \\u2013 for fishing as well as collection of forest products such as honey and medicinal plants. However, the Sundans are a dynamic landscape, changing due to climate variability and human-induced land use. Understanding what drives livelihoods choices and how these choices can contribute in adapting to changing climatic conditions in a context of increasing climate instability is key for ensuring resilience of people in Sundan. For this, we need to take stock of livelihoods options of those communities who have been adapting and living in these ecosystems since long, to understand how they have adapted in past as compared to those who\",\"A study of farmers' awareness about climate change and adaptation practices in India\\nAbstract.\\nKeywords\\nReferences\\nBhattacharya S and Pattanayak S, \\\"Assessing the impact of climate on agricultural production through spatial analysis\\\", Global Environ.

The results from the participatory survey show that the small-scale farmers in this region have adopted agroforestry (AGF), conservation agriculture, mixed cropping, intercropping and inter-seasonal cropland management practices. These farming practices, when practised collectively, can contribute significantly towards adaptation to climate shocks. This is because these practices have the ability to improve crop yields in droughts and floods and protect against soil erosion in floods, and to maintain soil moisture and fertility in dry spells. Moreover, the farmers' participation in various agricultural development activities such as agro-foresty, conservation agricultural farming, integrated farming and farm mechanization have improved their adaptive capacity\",\"Relationship between historical sea-surface temperature variability and climate change-induced coral mortality in the western Indian Ocean\\n- First Online:\\nAbstract\\nThe relationship between past and present sea surface temperatures and sea level rise (SLR) and their impact on coral reefs were investigated using coral growth rates [1, 2] and coral bleaching ([1], 3) from 10 coral reef monitoring sites around the Indian ocean.

A series of interviews with community representatives (\\u2018panchayat\\u2019) and key informants ('kumaonis') and observations of agricultural fields and livestock were conducted. The UKRV is characterized by high levels of precipitation during the main monsoon season, a \\u2018dry\\u2019 period of around three months from May to August, an increase in average summer temperatures, changes to precipitation and temperature patterns during winter season and an earlier onset of spring snowmelt.

Roof area constitutes a major proportion in the built environment and the roof plays a vital role in protecting the building and also in regulating the internal thermal comfort of the buildings, thus affecting the indoor climate. In the present study, the effect of using cool roofs to reduce the heat transfer into and from the structure, was investigated using a calibrated simulation tool developed based on a simplified energy model. The study was carried out using the calibrated cooling simulation model and validated it with the actual data of a typical building of India. Results obtained from this validated model were found to be in excellent agreement with field data. This model can be used for assessing the energy efficiency of buildings with different climatic conditions and can serve as an important tool for decision making of selecting the suitable materials for the roofs in different parts\",\"Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city: A case study of Delhi\\nAbstractAims: To study the urban climate of the city of New Delhi (India), the capital, in relation to the climatic characteristics of its local zones, namely, the \\\"cool city\\\" area, located in its southwestern part, and the rest of \\u2026\\nShare - Bookmark\\n- Download from\\n-%2010.%20pdf\\nPDF\\u002fA\",\"Zoogeography of West Indian vertebrates in relation to Pleistocene climatic cycles\\nAbstract\\nZOOGEOGRAPHIC relationships among species, and the relative effects of Pleisto-cene climatic fluctuations on West India were investigated by comparing zoogeographical data with the distribution of fossil vertebral material from the Pleiocene of the Caribbean. The Caribbean vertebra fauna is dominated by the large herbivores such as the tapirs, the glyptodonts, proboscideans and mastodonders, but it contains a significant proportion of small carnivorous mammals which are absent in modern West Indies. These mammals probably originated in South America. They were not present in the West African zoogeo-graphy during the Oligocene, so that they must have been present during a climatic period that was warmer than now. This warming is suggested to be a response to a northward advance in polar ice.

The Indian Sea plays an important role in modulating the large scale circulation, including its role on global climate and weather pattern. This study examines the linkages between inter-annual sea level pressure ((TLS) pressure) teleconnections and SST variability in order to understand the interrelationships between these large climate patterns. These large modes are identified using the principal component analysis, where the first mode of inter annual variation of 30 year smoothed TLS is identified as a proxy for a large SSTA event, and the second mode is a representation of a local scale weather system.\\nThe study reveals strong connections between the sea-level\",\"Predictability of Northwest Pacific climate during summer and the role of the tropical Indian Ocean\\n- 1Atmospheric and Oceanic Research Institute (IARI), Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology - JAMSTEC, Yokosuka 237-0061, Japan\\nAbstract.

There is a need for a critical examination of the planning of urban greens in the context of adaptation to extreme events. The review aims to explore the role of green in adaptation, the extent of their planning in urban spaces, and to assess their potential contribution to adaptation. We found that urban trees, vegetation and green infrastructure are increasingly considered by local authorities as key elements of climate resilience through urban heat island mitigation, biodiversity conservation, water cycle regulation, urban cooling and air quality improvement. Urban tree-planting programmes are a key adaptation response in India, while green roofs and vegetative green walls are being increasingly implemented at large scale in many Indian and international cities as part of a broader suite of measures to adapt urban environments to future extremes.\\nKeywords: Adaptation; Climate change; Green infrastructure\",\"Coupled model simulations of twentieth century climate of the Indian summer monsoon\\nAuthor\\nKrishnan, S.\\nGnanadesikan, A.

Based on data from 2000-01 to 2014-15, the study reveals the role of migration as an adaptation mechanism in the face of climate risk, especially in light of the recent heat wave in 2020. The findings indicate that the climate shock in summer has increased the propensity of male migrants from the village to migrate to urban destinations. In contrast, female migrants do not change their destination. These results indicate the different coping mechanisms adopted by farmers depending on their gender, age, and education.\\nKeywords\\nDOI:\\nISSN: 1920 \\u2013 4406 (Online)\\nIndexed in AGRIS, CNKI, EBSCO, Google Scholar, CiteFactor and ISC.\",\"humoral defence factors in indian river prawn, macrobrachium malcolmsonii.\\n\\nThe humoral immune response of adult Indian river shrimp, Macrobrachiun malcomsoni to various bacterial and fungal pathogens was evaluated.

We used a model of the global dispersal of mammals to estimate the impact of climate warming on the spread of this species. Our results show that the species is unlikely to expand outside its range unless the climate warms by at least 2.3oC. Climate warming beyond these values would cause the mongose to reach areas with suitable temperature but the lack of suitable prey would limit its expansion further. This is the first time a species has been assessed for its climate suitability by combining global climate and prey species distribution data. The results suggest that climate is a better predictor of range expansion than prey availability in this invasive species, a finding that highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in the assessment of global change impact.\\nIntroduction\\nThe global distribution of species and the processes that control the extent of their range are key questions to address in order to understand the potential impact that global warming might have on species\",\"Why is the amplitude of the Indian Ocean Dipole overly large in CMIP3 and CMIP5 climate models?\\n- 1Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, University of Bayreuth, Universit\\u00e4tsstra\\u00dfe 30, 95447 Bayern, Germany\\nAbstract.

A review of current adaptive design and construction practices in higher eduction institutes was carried out to assess the state of adaptation in this area. These practices were then evaluated based on a set of indicators to identify gaps in adaptive capacity in Indian educational infrastructure design practice. The identified gaps were assessed for current practices, as well as for future adaptation requirements. This analysis was followed by a discussion of potential adaptive pathway opportunities in urban India and suggested measures for improving disaster resilience. It is concluded that adaptive educational practices are still nascent in many parts of India. Current and emerging practices require greater attention from educational stakeholders as part of an adaptive strategy for infrastructure for the disaster risk and climate change era to develop.\\nKeywords\\nDOI:\",\"American Indians, climate change, and ethics for a warming world.\\nBy John E.

As this climate shifts, communities in these areas will be impacted by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. These changes will have impacts on the economy and environment. Climate adaptation is necessary for communities to survive and thrive into the future. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reports that adaptation will likely be more cost effective than mitigation, particularly for rural communities. However, there are barriers that prevent some tribes and indigenous communities from adapting to climate changes. This study will address two main questions. First,\",\"Climate change & infectious diseases in India: Implications for health care providers\\nDr Poonam Khetrapal Singh is a Senior Fellow and the Regional Director South Asia of The George Institute for Global Health, India, where she is responsible for the institute\\u2019s strategic direction, research, advocacy, and public engagement in South India.

It is found that these intensifiers \\u2013 defined here as the ratio of maximum cycloon-monthly precipitation to minimum monthly precipitation \\u2014 are associated with a shift in atmospheric circulation to the east and north, and are linked with an intensified subtropical anticyclone (\\u003c5\\u00b0S). A similar circulation shift, with associated intensifier, is seen in a 1983\\u20131984 climate season.\",\"A novel study for determining early life degradation of multi-crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules observed in western Himalayan Indian climatic conditions\\nDate2021-08-06\\nAuthor\\nSharma, Anu\\nKhan, Mubashar\\nSingh, Gaurav\\nMishra, A.P.\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nPhotovoltaic module degradation is a crucial concern for solar PV plant owners and manufacturers. The primary concern is that the degradation may be caused due to external factors such as weathering, UV radiation and mechanical damage. This study aims to determine if the multi crystalline silicon solar modules degrade due the external environment of western Himalayas by measuring their degradation over the first four years of operation. A laboratory set up was used to expose solar panels to different levels of heat, humidity and light. These factors are considered to be the main contributors to degradation under field condition. Solar PV modules were tested by monitoring and recording power output of the panel under varying temperature and humidity. After 4 years, the test\",\"What drives media attention for climate change? Explaining issue attention in Australian, German and Indian print media from 1996 to 2010\\nThis paper investigates the media coverage of climate issues in Australia, India and Germany over the 15 years of 2000-2014. We analyse how issues are framed by the print press, how the coverage varies over time and whether the climate debate influences media reporting on other environmental issues. By using a quantitative text analysis of all climate articles in three national newspapers over a period of almost two decades, we find that the frequency of coverage and the framing of the issue differ markedly from one country to the next and that media reports on climate in Germany have become increasingly prominent. However, our analysis shows that coverage in India is relatively stable and Australian media report on the problem of global warming at a similar rate as before. The paper highlights the fact that while climate is a topic of growing concern worldwide, the reporting of it by print newspapers varies substantially. In India, where the impact of a warming climate will be significant in the future, and in countries with an established climate movement\",\"Climate change: implications for Indian agriculture and food security, climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, and implications of climate variability and climate extremes on Indian agro-ecosystems.\\nClimate-smart farming is the key to ensure climate-resilient food systems: Dr. M.

In this paper, we investigate the IO warming trend during the period of 1960 2004 using data from a coupled climate model. We use two sets of the model experiments: one uses 20th-century observations of surface temperature and sea level pressure, and one includes 30-yr-long re-analyses of ocean temperature, salinity and density to estimate the interocean temperature difference. The model results demonstrate that there is a 0.3\\u00b0C warming in 1990\\u20132011 (\\u003e50% of warming occurred since 1979) and a further 3.6\\u00b0 2.9\\u00b0, 8\\u00b0 and 9.5\\u00b0.\\nKey Points:\\n- We show that the recent warming of IO, which was not observed in observations, was simulated in a state-\",\"Reliability of regional and global climate models to simulate precipitation extremes over India\\nKumar S and Chandra S (2011): 'Relability of Regional and Global Climate Models to Simulate Precipitation Extremes over the Ind\\n- Climate change\\nThis is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\",\"Evaporation-precipitation variability over Indian Ocean and its assessment in NCEP Climate Forecast System (CFSv2) reanalysis data\\nAbstract\\nIndian Ocean is one of the largest tropical ocean in the world covering an area of 73.2 m km\\u00b2. The Indian monsoon plays a key role in influencing regional climate variability and changes. In the present study, the evaporation- precipitation variability is investigated over the Indian region using the Ncep CFS v2 Reanalysis (.nc format) data. A total of six variables are used to study the temporal & spatial variability of E-P variability using various statistical methods. To evaluate the model, a statistical technique is applied by comparing ENSO index. Further, EO and AO Index are also used as model validation parameter. Results show that the inter-annual variations are more prominent than intrans- annual variability. It also observed that E and P show maximum positive variance during the monsoonal period and maximum negative during pre-monsoons. This study also shows that maximum E variability during EI 2012 \\u2013 13\",\"Assessing the impacts of changing land cover and climate on Hokersar wetland in Indian Himalayas\\nLand use, land-cover and climatic change are known to affect aquatic ecosystems. The effects of land use change have attracted much of the recent scientific attention, but the effects on the functioning of wet ecosystems have remained relatively poorly studied.\\nIn the present study, the influence of a changing vegetation structure and its effects are examined on wet meadow ecosystem in the Himalayan foothills, India. Wet meadows in this area are dominated by species of Carex and Juncus, which are typical aquatic wet species. In the wet meadowe studied, a gradual shift from a wet to a dry meadow can be observed. This shift can have implications for the ecosystem. We hypothesized that the vegetation composition of this wet site has been altered by anthropogenic activities, such as land clearance for cropping and shifting cultivation, and is now closer to what it would be in drier conditions. To examine how vegetation and environmental variables affect the functional characteristics of an aquatic ecosystem, we conducted\",\"Monthly energy and exergy analysis of hybrid photovoltaic thermal (PV\\u002fT) system for the Indian climate [PDF]A.

The survey was conducted from January to September 2016. A total of 120 farmers (60 from the hill and 60 low land areas) were interviewed. In this study, it was found that farmers were aware that climate is changing but they didn\\u2019t have the perception of change of their own environment. This perception was significantly different among different categories of farmers. Hill farmers perceived climate to be changing, whereas lowland farmers did not show any change in their environment and thought of themselves as \\u2018climate resilient\\u2019. The results showed that low-land farmer perceived risk of water, soil erosion and pests as greater than the high-landers.

Coral bleachers are one of the best indicators of coral reef health, and in 1998 bleached and dead corals were found on all coral atolls in French Polynesia, which was previously considered to be an area with little impact of climate changes. The bleaches were not only the longest recorded, lasting almost four months on the atoll of Moorea, in a region that usually has two to three months bleeching, they were also among those longest in terms of area affected. These were the first recorded bleeches for French polynesia and the most extensive bleachings ever reported in any tropical coral region. We review the bleache and their ecological implications with a focus on their relationship to climate variation, the role of local factors such as water quality and sedimentation, reef fish community structure and dynamics,\",\"How sensitive is Indian agriculture to climate change? A recent study of the agricultural sector in India by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that the sector is very vulnerable, and that climate-related hazards such as extreme drought, heavy rain and extreme heat events have led to crop damage, livestock deaths, water shortages for irrigation and increased water logging.\\nThe study shows, for example, that more than 50 percent of India\\u2019s agricultural output depends on rainfed agriculture.

vehicle charging infrastructure in India: viability analysis using DEA\\nAbstract\\nElectric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant market momentum in the automotive industry, and several countries have announced ambitious targets for electric mobility by 2030. However, the adoption of EVs faces a significant challenge in terms of the absence of an EV ecosystem. This study evaluates the viability of EV charging stations and assesses the performance of 10 charging companies operating in three different regions. The study finds that 3 out of every 4 charging facilities do not break even. It suggests that companies have to focus on reducing operational and infrastructure capex costs to reduce their charging cost and improve profitability.\\nThe study also found that charging facility capitals are highly concentrated and the market is dominated by a few companies, indicating a potential for consolidation in future.\",\"The impact of infrastructure provisioning on inequality in India: does the level of development matter?\\n- Authors\\nAbstract\\nInfrastructure provision is one of the most important determinants of poverty reduction. This study investigates the impact on rural-urban inequality of two different types of infrastructures in rural India during the last two decades. Our main focus is on electricity, irrigation, roads and transport. In rural areas, we find a positive and significant relationship between the number of electrification projects and inequality. A negative and insignificant link with the rural\\u2013urban distribution of irrigation projects was found. On the contrary, road and rail projects were negatively related to inequality at the village level.

The analysis focuses mainly on three states where large sample surveys exist. Using the Demographic and Health Surveys 2012 for 22 states, this study estimates the probability of institutional delivery and its determinants \\u2014 distance, economic characteristics of the household and health characteristics. Results suggest that distance does matter, but the effects are not uniform across all the states. While the distance from the home to the delivery site has a negative effect on institutional deliveries, the same does not hold for the quality of care at the facility or maternal and foetal health. In fact, it is the socio economic conditions of rural India that seem to be driving decisions to deliver at home or at public facilities.\\nDownload the publication here.\",\"Exploring relationships among ethical climate types and organizational commitment: A case of Indian banking sector\\nAbstract\\nEthical climate at the organizational level is a key determinant of organizational outcomes. This study explores the impact of two different types of ethics climate on the employee commitment and the effect of ethical practices on these climates. It also studies how these two dimensions of climates interact with job performance in the Indian bank sector. The results show that in an Indian context, an ethical culture with high levels of fairness and integrity is more beneficial than a culture that is less ethical, in terms of job and personal commitment. A strong ethical orientation also has an impact on organizational performance. Further, results indicate that the two types interact in different ways on commitment; fairness climate has a positive impact, whereas honesty climate is negatively impacted by ethical climates that are less honest. In sum, the findings indicate an interdependency between an organization\\u2019s ethical and ethical commitment climates on job satisfaction and performance outcomes, thereby supporting the argument that an employee\\u2019 willingness to remain with the organization is an outcome of both an individual\",\"A comparison of India and China's foreign investment strategy toward energy infrastructure\\n- Publication Type:\\n-.\",\"Scenario of viability gap funding (VGF) concept in Indian infrastructure projects- a case study\\nThis study presents the results of an empirical analysis of the VGF scheme implemented by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in the Indian state.

It plays an instrumental role in the overall development of economy through efficient mobility of both goods and services. In this regard, the role of transport infrastructure is of paramount importance in any developing nation. The present study investigates the long-run relationship among the transport, industrial and energy variables. Using cointegration approach, a three-variable system is tested. Co-integration, vector error correction model and Granger causation test have been employed in order to investigate the causal relationship between the variables in short-term and long term. We find strong causal linkage between energy, transport and industrial variables for India. Moreover, we found a unidirectional causatory relationship from energy to industrial output and from industrial to transport output. This finding supports the hypothesis of Koop et al.

However, in the aftermath of the project' completion, the road network was unable to meet the expectations of users and has failed to achieve the level of traffic it is capable of supporting. To address the issue, this paper uses a large-scale survey of over 1000 households on the GQL and a road-network travel cost model to assess the role of road infrastructure in household travel decisions. A number of factors are found to be important determinants of household' choice of travel mode, which are also found in a previous survey.

It uses a nationally representative data set on households from India's Rural Household Survey (RHS). The empirical results indicate that households residing in the tropical zone are poorer and have lower access to sanitation, education and improved health facilities as compared to households in other climatic regions. However, the results of the multinomial logit analysis show that the association between the climatic zone and poverty depends, to a large extent, on the nature of household housing - i.e. whether the household is urban'slum' dwelling or rural dwelling. The results suggest that rural \\\"non-slums\\\" and slums are the poorest, and urban dwelling is the richest.

However, there has not been a corresponding growth in road networks in urban areas and the existing roads have not seen much maintenance. The construction and maintenance of the roads in a country like India is one of its most significant development issues, but little attention has so far been paid to the impacts of roads on local communities living nearby. In India, many people are affected by road construction projects, and a growing literature shows that the environmental, economic and social impacts are not well managed.

In this framework, infrastructure projects are analysed according to their characteristics and the financial market's view of them. This framework allows the construction of a country-by-country infrastructure risk matrix. Using such a matrix, a set of infrastructure sectors can be identified, which are likely to provide a high level of return to capital while maintaining a low level.\\n- Kiyotaki, Nobuhiro & Wright, Randall, 1998. \\\"On money as a means of payment,\\\" Journal of Monetary Economics, Elsevier, vol..\",\"Gaps in Health Infrastructure in Indian Scenario: A Review\\nAbstract\\nThe present study was undertaken to identify and explore the gaps in health infrastructure in our country \\u2013 \\u201cIndia\\u201d. The study revealed that there is a wide variation in the availability of various facilities among different states in India. The availability in various states are: Primary health centre (PHC) is available in all states, 50% of the total states have sub-centre available, and 33% states has a dispensary available. Among tertiary health care facilities, hospitals are available at a rate of 80% in some states. In terms of doctors, the study shows a significant gap between the number needed and doctors available for a state. For all the states combined it shows that the required doctors are 8.7 times as much as that currently available - 1.3 lakhs in 2011 as compared to 16,100 in actual available number of physicians [2010-11].

This relationship is studied for various sectors, over the period 2001-2006, using the Balassa-Samuelson effect, energy productivity and energy labour ratio. The findings indicate that a positive, significant and increasing relationship exists between energy usage and productivity for the entire Indian economy. In addition, the relationship between the energy use and output is found to be more significant in case -of manufacturing sectors than in primary sector, while for both manufacturing and primary sectors it is negative at the early stage of development, but turns positive after a lag of 3-5 years. For a sub-set of manufacturing sector the impact of productivity is significantly higher than energy. However, in energy the impacts of labour and capital are more substantial, especially in manufacturing, than that of energy: 125-141\\nThis item\",\"Health infrastructure & immunization coverage in rural India: evidence from NFHS-4.\\nThis paper investigates the health infrastructure and immunization service delivery in 17 states of India in the year 2015-16. We use a unique, comprehensive, and nationally representative survey (National Family Health Survey-four, NFCS-IV) to analyze the coverage of various immunization services, access to public hospitals with emergency services and the quality of public health facilities in these rural regions. In the analysis, we also control for the state of health and demographic characteristics of people to capture the heterogeneity of the region within India and to isolate the impact of these facilities from the other determinants. The key findings are that the states with low human capital and poor demographic outcomes have low coverage and quality in terms of immunization programs. Also the access, quality and cost of care in public sector hospitals is better in states which have high human development. Thus health service infrastructure is a critical determinant of coverage, accessibility and health outcomes\",\"Accessibility, infrastructure provision and residential land value: Modelling the relation using geographic weighted regression in the city of Rajkot, India\\n- 19 Downloads\\nAbstract\\nInfrastructure provision has been considered essential for urban development and sustainable growth, while it is still an area of concern for Indian planners. There is a growing recognition of the need for better infrastructure in Indian cities. Inadequate infrastructure is often blamed for low quality of life, environmental damage and social disparities. However, it remains unclear which types of infrastructure are associated with better quality or value of land and housing in particular, and what factors can explain these relations. This paper examines the effect of different types and levels of accessibility and infrastructure on residential value in Rajokat. Accessibility measures used were travel time to key locations and the distance to railway stations. A total of 1000 residential properties were selected as the data was available for both accessibility measures. For analysis, data were collected using Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR).

The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the current status of drinking water provision to households, and its implications for urban development and to explore possible policy options to improve it. To this end, the paper develops a mathematical framework to estimate the optimal capacity of a water distribution network for each city based on household densities, household size, water use, access to piped network and other factors. A simulation exercise with two scenarios shows that a network of 10 km radius with a pumping capacity to cover the entire city can be sufficient to meet the drinking needs of the city, if the household sizes of all cities can shrink from the average of their current sizes to 2.5\",\"Sustaining India's irrigation infrastructure\\nThe government needs to invest more in irrigation and improve the efficiency of its use.\\nIn India, the use of irrigation has increased from 60% in 1980 to 80-90% currently.

In response to this, they have developed a system based on self-supply of water through private wells and cisterns, often located in shared spaces. The study uses ethnography and participatory mapping to examine how the urban water system has been organised and governed through the private sector and by local government, in a poor neighbourhood. Drawing on the theoretical concepts of legal geographies, the study reveals how water infrastructure and the water service are divided between public and private sectors in informal settlements, and how this division is a result of the exclusion of public infrastructure in these communities.\\nDescription\\nCitation : Goggin, S. and Sridharan, K.

However, it is important for growth of the country's economy and to create jobs. The infrastructure projects undertaken by public sector enterprises in the past have been plagued by a number of challenges, mainly with respect to financing. In addition, the projects are often delayed due to land issues, lack of environmental clearances and disputes with locals. Further, due delays in infrastructure project delivery, many projects become unviable. As a result, there is an urgent need to review and improve the financing models for infrastructure.\\nKey challenges and issues\\nThere are a variety of issues associated with infrastructure financing in emerging economies. Some common issues are:\\n\\u00b7 Financing the entire lifecycle: Financing infrastructure assets requires long investment cycles.

HR practitioners are increasingly being called upon to be responsible in the context of climate change and climate action. Therefore, it is important to examine the role of human resource development in building organisational commitments for climate actions. The purpose of the study is to understand the dimensions of Human Resource Development (HR) climate on organisational climate commitments in India. To test this, the research employed a survey design to collect responses from HR professionals working at different levels. Using a five-point Likert scale, survey responses were collected from the HR professional population.

The study aims to understand the extent to which the statutory infrastructural provisions made in 1991 have been used and how the spatial form of planning and developmental activities have changed in this peri urban area, since then. A GIS based spatial analysis was undertaken to map the infrastructual network and to compare the patterns and the density of these structures in both the periurban areas and in other areas of city, where there are statutory structures, using the data obtained from government and non-government agencies. Further, the study explores how these statutory infrastructures have affected the pattern of spatial use and growth of land use.\",\"The rainbow metaphor: spatial data infrastructure organization and implementation in India\\nAbstract\\nRainbow metaphors are used frequently in the literature to describe the structure and dynamics of spatial information management systems. In India, the implementation of a national spatial database, called the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), is currently taking place. The implementation process has been characterized by many of the features that characterize the use of rainbow metaphors. We describe in this paper how we observed the metaphor in use during the process of NSDI implementation. Our observations of this system are based on the work of other authors on NDSIs, and on an analysis of documents that describe and describe implementation plans. As a result of our observations, we discuss a number of characteristics and processes that appear in NSSDI implementation that we describe as the rainbow characteristics of implementation, based primarily on work by Gatre and Gogte in their studies of national databases for water resources and rural development in Maharashtra, India.\",\"Why Do Indian States Differ in Their Infrastructure Development? The Role of Political Instability\\nThe role of political instability is explored through a panel data of 32 Indian states for the period 1901-2004. We find that the infrastructure performance of the least-developed states increases when political parties change and the number of coalition governments falls, while it declines when the political system remains stable. The results suggest that coalition parties and stable government may increase the risk of corruption and lead to more political rents for politicians, which in turn may reduce public investment. These results are robust to a variety of specifications and empirical strategies. They also remain significant after controlling for economic factors and other institutional differences such as land use regulation, and after the inclusion of lagged and lag-squared infrastructure indicators in the analysis.\",\"Measuring safety culture on ships using safety climate: a study among Indian officers in international shipping\\n-\\nPublication Date2017\\nPublisherName of ConferenceInternational Conference of the International Society of Marine Engineers (ISME)\\nDocument VersionPublished\\nLanguageen\\nTypePresentation\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nConference\\u002fEvent nameInternational Society for Marine Engineering 2016, ISME 16\\nSubjectsTransportation\\nAbstractThis paper describes the development and validation of a measure of Safety Culture \\u2013 Safety Climate (\\u201cSafety Climate\\u201d) in the Indian Shipping Industry.

The system uses two measures of infrastructural access: physical infrastructure measured by distance to main market and secondary market, and social infrastructure as distance from a hospital or a school. It also uses agricultural and non-agricultural inputs and outputs to the agricultural sector. Results indicate a positive and significant long-run relationship between agricultural inputs, outputs and physical and especially social infrastructur, while non farm inputs are found to have a negative impact.\\n- A.

The study sought to examine different factors that have contributed to poor development of human habitation in urban and rural areas. This has been done through an analysis of factors such as lack of access to land, inadequate infrastructure, high cost of land and housing, and poor access for water, drainage and waste facilities. It has also sought answers to questions such, as why some settlements have developed at faster rates than others, why there is still a large disparity in the provision of services across regions and urban areas and why infrastructure provision has remained a constant issue in rural and small urban settlements despite government interventions over the years. To address these questions, the research has employed a mix\",\"Towards sustainable development: The impact of transport infrastructure expenditure on the ecological footprint in India\\nSukumaran, A., & Chandrajit Banerjee, S.

We use data from a survey covering 120 such projects. Based on the survey data and using a two-step least squares technique, the paper identifies and tests the determinants which are most likely to explain the variation in the return on investment. The paper finds that profitability of projects is negatively related to the share of debt in project capitalisation. Further, projects with higher capital investment have higher profitability than those with lower capital investments. This suggests that a project\\u2019s capital intensity determines its profitability. It is also found that the project profitability is higher when the projects are implemented with the participation of the State government or when it is a \\u2018build and transfer\\u2019 project as in comparison with 'build, own and operate\\u2019 projects or PPPs involving only a long term lease.

While a growing number of studies document the environmental impacts of infrastructure on land and ecosystems, little is known about the ecological effects of highway transportation on marine ecosystems. This study investigated the impacts on benthic macrofaunal communities of a marine embankment built along State Road A-1-A (SR 1) in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The study included two sections of SR - 10 miles each, with one section built over the 1992-1993 period and the control section not built until 2001. Both sections were sampled during low tide in the summer of 2012. We compared the assemblages and abundances of bivalves, gastropods, crustaceans, nematodes, echinoids and other marine organisms from the two embanked sections to the nearby controls to determine which section of Highway \\\"A-I\\\" has the greatest negative impact\",\"Studying potential use of Automation products for Infrastructure Construction in Indian context.\\nThe study focused on Infrastructure construction industry in India and its impact on the labour cost. Automation was identified as one of the key technologies in reducing the overall construction cost and to make the construction work place safer for its labourers. It is also important to note that India is in the process to become a super power and it should adopt technologies that can make its construction sector competitive in global market. In India, there are many construction companies which are adopting the latest technologies. The study identifies the potential of automation products to improve the productivity and reduce the cost of Infrastructure industry. This study was conducted with a primary and secondary research method. Primary research involved 30 face-to-face interviews with industry practitioners and government officers and officials. Secondary research was done using various reports, journals, articles and books.\",\"Financing infrastructure projects through publicprivate partnerships in India : a critical assessment of institutional arrangements\\nPublic-private partnership (PPP) is increasingly being used to develop infrastructure in the developing world.

Total factor technological efficiency has been estimated by means of Malmquist index and DEA-based Malinvaud index to assess the efficiency gains in manufacturing industry and also to measure the technical change of industries. The estimates suggest that the rate of change in technical intensity of the Indian industry is 3.7 percent per annum, which implies that technical progress is being made at a relatively fast rate in Indian industries with the exception of textiles and food processing industries where technological improvement is slower. We also find evidence of efficiency gain in the manufacturing sector as the Malvintus Malindu index of aggregate technical efficiencies is rising steadily. This is further confirmed by DEA analysis, as aggregate total technical technical (2015)\\nIssue ()\\nPages : 1-\",\"Financing the boom in public-private partnerships in Indian infrastructure: Trends and policy implications\\n- Authors\\nAbstract\\nThis paper discusses the policy and institutional issues associated with public\\u2013private partnership (PPP) in India.

The model takes account of technological progress, population, and environmental degradation. These variables are related to the production functions, the demand for infrastructure and their prices. In a national system, it is assumed that a country is a homogeneous unit and the infrastructure supply is determined by the prices prevailing in the economy and technological change. A regional system takes into account the regional nature, i.e., the spatial nature of infrastructure requirements and its demand. It is shown theoretically, as well as empirically that the model is capable of capturing the dynamic interaction of factors affecting infrastructure demand and supply and hence provides a useful model for the analysis of long term infrastructure planning. Further, a simulation analysis is carried out to study the interaction between infrastructure, technological advance and population\",\"Infrastructure in India: The Present Status and Its Constraints\\nThe [\\u2026]\",\"Overview of the initiatives in renewable energy sector under the national action plan on climate change in India.\\nThe Ministry of New & Renewable Energy (MNRE) had initiated a series of actions for implementation of national solar mission in July 2009.

The study focuses on the provision of access by private companies and households to the water sector. It examines whether the poor have been helped and whether access is sustainable. Access to safe water has increased in all districts except two. Water quality has improved and the number of users has grown in most cases. Private companies have played an important role in providing access for some groups, especially the urban poor. However, in other places, the state, NGOs and community organizations have provided a larger proportion of the infrastructure. This shows that there has not been a clear shift towards the private sector in the sector as a whole. Households have benefited from microcredits in terms of increased access, improved sanitation levels and improved quality of water. There are a number factors that explain why the results of micro credits do not translate into access.\",\"Revitalizing Infrastructure Sector to Accelerate Economic Recovery in India: PM\\nRevamping the infrastructure sector is key to kick-start economic activities in the country, which has been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday.

Based on these, it suggests how the experience gained during the past 2 years can be utilized in formulating a more realistic and relevant approach to monitoring the quality of services. This includes the formulation of a system that will help in measuring the level of satisfaction of users, and in assessing the impact of infrastructural services on various indicators of development.): 5 (September 2006)\\nIssue (:\\n- Sajda S. & Kahn M.

We use a newly developed index of income equality to measure the extent of inequality and a panel data approach in order to capture the influence of various factors. The empirical results indicate that health and educational infrastructure have reduced the gap between rich and poor but transport has increased inequalities. This is in line with the theoretical arguments on the role of transport in income distribution.\",\"Government policies and foreign direct investment inflows: Evidence from infrastructure sector in India\\n- DOI\\nAbstract\\nInfrastructure sector plays a pivotal role in economic development of a country. However, it requires long gestation period and large investment outlay. The government has a crucial role to play in the creation of enabling environment for infrastructure investment in economy. This study analyses the impact of government policies on FDI inflow in infrastructure sectors in Indian economy during 2007-16. We have used the panel data of 20 infrastructure services and the results show that FIPL, IFCI, LIC and SID are statistically significant in all infrastructure subsector except in transport infrastructure. Infrastructure subsectors such as transport, electricity and natural gas have been found to be the most vulnerable to the government policy. In other words, the policy measures taken by the Government in these sectors are ineffective in attracting FII.\",\"Health infrastructure in India: The input and output association with economic growth\\nAbstract:\\nThis paper analyses the relationship between health infrastructure and economic development in a panel setting. This study uses panel data for 16 countries, covering the period from 1970 to 2014, based on primary and secondary data from World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development. We employ two methods \\u2014 panel co-integration and vector auto-regression (VAR) for cointegration analysis and impulse response function approach for impact evaluation. The paper provides strong evidence of the cointegrating relationship among health inputs and health output. It is further established that an increase in health input leads to an increasing health outcome. An increase of 1 percentage point in public health expenditure leads 0.8 percentage points and increase 2 per cent point of private health spending leads, respectively, to a decline in infant and adult mortality.

The study is undertaken by using panel ordinary least square, fixed effect regression model. Empirical results suggest that the government's expenditure and the size of infrastructure are significant determinants in PPP. In addition, the study also reveals that in case of road projects, government spending, and size are positive while government borrowing and project location are negative. Further, it is found that government expenditure, project size and bank finance have significantly and positively impact on the PPP in roads sector.\\nThe study concludes that there should be a greater emphasis on improving project management and financial management in order to promote PPPs. It also recommends that governments should focus on infrastructure investment in rural areas to reduce ruralurban migration. Moreover, banks should increase their\",\"Infrastructure and Human development in India: An Inter-state comparison\\nAbstractThis paper attempts to estimate infrastructure indicators for all the states and Union territories of India, for the period 1950-2006, using a system of national accounts.

Using a panel data set, the study analyses the effect of these public interventions on the distribution of income among rural households in a sample of Indian states and among households of different wealth groups over the period 1973\\u20132000. The results show that, although the overall distribution has become more unequal, provision and investment in basic public infrastructure have reduced inequality among rich households, but not among poor ones. Public infrastructure investments have been more beneficial to poor people in states with high levels of per capita income in the pre-reforms era. In contrast, there is no impact at all on poor families in high-performing states.\\n- S. V.

There is a strong consensus that the infrastructure development in the country has been lagging behind in comparison to the global scenario. It is observed that there has not been much investment in infrastructure, in spite of high growth rate witnessed in recent years. In this context a detailed analysis of Indian infrastructure sector has become necessary. This paper is an attempt to study the political factors behind India\\u2019s infrastructural development.

An empirical analysis for India\\nAbstractThe main objective of this paper is to study the impact of governance qualities and information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure on the performance of tax collection in the country of India. It is argued that the quality of political institutions is the key determinant of the overall tax performance. In particular, it is believed that a better and more responsive governance structure and stronger accountability are the main preconditions for successful tax mobilizations. The empirical tests show that in general, higher tax revenues are achieved by better quality political environment. On the other hand, ICT infrastructures seem to play a very important role in tax administration and collection systems of various countries. A significant and positive relationship between these variables is revealed by the study. Thus, we conclude from our empirical findings that ICT can play the crucial role by increasing the collection of revenues. We believe that our results can help the Indian Government for the effective and efficient collection and utilisation of public taxes.

The study is based on the theoretical arguments on which the European Union\\u2019s Structural Funds are based. It uses a set of econometric models to test the effect of capital accumulation on GDP growth. Empirical evidence for this purpose is extracted from 18 European countries for the period 1970-1997, with the aim of investigating the relationship between growth and investment. An empirical investigation of this relationship is carried out by means of a system of panel cointegration and vector error correlation models with structural breaks. This is a challenging task because the empirical literature on structural change has been largely neglected. Results reveal the existence of an inverse relationship in all countries studied between total infrastructure capital stock and GDP. These empirical results are robust, even after controlling for various macro-economic variables, and can be explained by a combination of two mechanisms: direct and indirect ones.

The objective of the present study is therefore, to study the various modes through which airports in different countries of Asia and South-East Asia have been privatised. In recent decades, the airports and the aviation industry have undergone significant changes as part of privatisations in various countries in Asia. As a result, airports have become an integral part in any citys economy. This study examines the different models that have adopted in privatizing different airports through the world. It also examines various issues and challenges encountered in implementing privatizations and suggests measures that can be undertaken.\\nBibliographical Information:\\nAdvisor:Verma, R.P.C.; Srivastava, P.K.M.D.T.S.; Gupta, J.N.; Bhattach\",\"Infrastructure at crossroads: The challenges of governance and financing\\nA high-level panel on \\u2018Infras for Growth and Development\\u2019 at the World Economic Forum 2019.\\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock,\\nAs the global economy is expected to contract for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, the infrastructure gap in the developing world continues to widen. The global infrastructure deficit stands at $90 trillion by 2030, according to the OECD, of which over 40% is in developing countries. While a large part of the shortfall is accounted for by a lack of funding, poor governance also plays a significant role. At the same time, infrastructure projects are increasingly seen as vehicles for development, and the importance of public-private-partnerships, especially in emerging markets, has grown substantially. In this environment of limited resources and greater expectations of infrastructure development in low-income economies, a new approach to governance is emerging.

Yet, to date, research has largely failed to address the issue of power inequalities, which can be seen as the key driver behind the rapid development and expansion of renewable energy systems. In India, the state government has been implementing renewable projects across the country to meet the growing demand for electricity. Kerala is at the forefront of this development in the south, having installed more than 3,800 MW of grid solar in just over ten years. The expansion has led to a surge of new projects and a proliferation of land acquisition in order to access sufficient land for development. But the local communities are often not consulted and their views disregarded in planning.

These indices provide a measure of the extent of access that people living in urban areas have to essential infrastructure as well as their living conditions and quality. In the present research, we employ the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression to find that housing is more accessible in large cities compared to smaller cities. This is particularly evident for people with lower socio- economic groups.

In this article, I analyze the role of these institutions in supporting infrastructure investment projects in four South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. I show that the WB and ADB are major financiers of public infrastructure and have supported a wide range of investments in the countries under study, including roads, ports, energy, water and sanitation, transport and logistics, telecommunications, railways and airports (Table 1). This is despite the fact that these four countries have some of the lowest public investment in infrastructure per capita and per GDP.\\nA recent analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that by 2050, South Asians will be the largest population group with an annual household income of less than US$10,000, with 600 million people falling into that bracket.1 To meet the infrastructure needs of a growing economy and\",\"COVID-19, Is India's health infrastructure equipped to handle an epidemic?\\nAs we know, that India is one of the most populated countries on this planet which has more than 1 billion people, which makes it a very difficult place to contain an outbreak as it\\u2019s very vast.\\nThe government of India has taken many measures to combat the COVID- 19 outbreak, including a 21-day nation wide lock-down from 26th March to 17th May 2020.

In the context of British rule, public infrastructure was a key element of political power, and the building of colonial infrastructure became a major instrument of imperial policy. However, little has been written about public architecture and infrastructure from a historiographical perspective. The present chapter will therefore examine, from an analytical perspective, both the nature of public buildings in Colonial India and their role as symbols of power and colonial rule. It will be argued that, although the buildings were often impressive in terms of architectural design, they were, in reality, an inadequate symbol of a modernised state and a civil society. They represented the colonial power's control over the local population rather than its political and\",\"Review of infrastructure development and its financing in India - II\\nReview on infrastructure sector in the country \\u2013 II :\\nThe Indian infrastructure and development sector has grown exponentially over the years as a result of various factors.

We use AR(p) and ARIMA models to analyse the time series properties of GDP, investment in road, rail and air transport, and FDIR (foreign direct inflow). We find evidence against the null hypothesis of long run cointegration of these variables. The result implies that infrastructure development, in turn, enhances economic development and foreign investment. However, the effect of foreign influsions on domestic investment is insignificant. Moreover, we test the significance of the causal relationship between investment-GDP and between FIRD and growth and find significant long term relation between the two, implying that foreign FIPs have a significant and positive impact on economic: 1257-1261\\nContact details of provider:\\nWeb page: in: Empirical Economics \",\"Regional distribution of infrastructure and basic amenities in urban India: Issues concerning empowerment of local bodies.\\nAbstract\\nThe paper explores the distribution and accessibility of infrastructural and service-based amenities across the urban districts of India using a unique database of 2,200 urban local self governments. We find that the share of urban areas served by the government with the basic and infrastructure services increases with an increasing urban size. The urban population living more than one kilometer away from public transport, public health, education, and water supply facilities is significantly higher in the larger cities. Further, we find an increase, rather than decrease, in inequality in service delivery across districts. Our results provide empirical support for the argument that local governments should be allowed to expand and provide more services to the population of their jurisdiction in a more decentralized and devolved environment, thereby reducing inequality.\",\"Infrastructure and use of ICT in university libraries of Rajasthan (India) : a study in three phases [by S.M.

The econometric analysis is based on the system GMM model using panel data of 14 South American countries. It has been found that the level of income per capita in a region has positive correlation with the amount of road infrastructure and the number of kilowatts of electricity produced. However, the effects of these two types of infrastructural development on economic growth are different. Road infrastructurally developed regions show higher rates of growth in income but the effect of electrical infrastructure is limited.\\nKeywords\\nReferences\\nAnwar I. and Razzak S. (2003).

The consulting industry is one of most profitable sectors in India. However, in such competitive industry, knowledge has always been a crucial factor. This is why, there is a great need to understand how the organization structure affect the knowledge of employees. There is also much research on the organizational structures; however, it is limited in its application to other sectors. Therefore, with a view to explore the role of organizational design on knowledge management in this sector, a case study has been conducted on Infrastructure consulting companies.

Using annual data from 1971 to 2008, the analysis indicates that the impact of the investment in infrastructure is not very different from investment spending in other sectors. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that a 1 percent increase in the ratio between the capital and the GDP is associated with a decline in real GDP of 0.7 percent. However, it may also be argued that an increase of capital spending of one unit increases GDP by about two units for every unit spent as an input in capital-intensive manufacturing industries.

The data are taken from a household survey in 1998. A multinomial logistic regression model has been adopted for the analysis. It is found that the demand for and utilization of primary care has increased with age, female gender, urban residence and higher education. Demand for hospital services has also increased over the period of the survey but has declined over time. Provisioning has improved over a period and has reached the rural communities as well. Female gender and urban residency have had a positive effect on the use of modern health facilities. However, the level of education and rural or urban resident status have not had any influence on health services utilization. Finally, this paper concludes that in the absence of adequate supply of infrastructure the need for health provision will be met through out-of-pocket expenditure or private health): \",\"Reengineering urban infrastructure: how the World Bank and Asian Development Bank shape urban infrastructure finance and governance in India and Vietnam\\nAbstractThe World Banks and the Asias Development Banks (ADB) 2005 Asian Urban Development Report [ADR] argues that the Asian urban crisis is rooted in the poor governance of urban services.

A non-parametric approach of data envelopment analysis is used to derive the production frontiers and measure the productivity of manufacturing establishments. The data covers the period between 1997-98 and 2001-02. We also use panel regression analysis to examine the effect of these infrastructure indicators and size of the establishment on the level of production. Finally, we estimate the total factor productivity, its components and decompose it into its labour and physical components. Our findings show that there has been a marked improvement and convergence in all the States, as evidenced by the significant improvements in total and labour productivity. Productivity gains were also found to be higher in large and medium sized firms and in those located in urban areas. Infrastructure, in particular, the physical infrastructure is found by our analysis, to have significantly\",\"Infrastructure inequality is a characteristic of urbanization. The most important indicators of the degree of inequality and its impact on the development of society are the level of development and the structure of infrastructure. In this study, the authors analyze the situation with the implementation of regional policy of Ukraine for the period of 2014-2020 on infrastructure development in the country and identify a few priority areas for increasing the effectiveness of public investment in this sphere.\\nThe aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of investments in transport infrastructure and regional roads on regional development using a dynamic panel data model. We find that investments into regional transport have a significant impact, while investments from the state budget have only a weak effect. Investments into the construction of roads have the highest effect on both the growth of per capita GDP and employment. This suggests that road investments have an important multiplier effect, but this effect is smaller than the effect of railway investments.\",\"India infrastructure database 2005-2006\\nExpand view\\nThis is the fourth edition of the India Infrastructure Database.

We investigate whether there is a link between the two at the aggregate, state, or regional level. The data set contains 2,300 districts. At the regional scale, we use the district level distance to the state headquarters as a proxy for bank penetration. Transport infrastructure is proxied by distance of the center of district to state capital. Our empirical analysis shows that transport does not impact banking, but banking impacts transport. In contrast to earlier research, the effect of banking is more significant on rural than urban areas.\",\"How the present would have looked like?

The main reason why PPP has become a popular method for infrastructure financing, is its flexibility and its ability to be customised and adjusted to the needs of each infrastructure sector. PPP is not a financing option in itself. It is rather the use of different financial instruments to provide a long-term loan in order to finance large infrastructure projects. In this case, public and private investors collaborate in a partnership to build, own, operate and maintain (BOO) infrastructure assets. This thesis is focusing on Green Field Bangalore Airport PPP Project \\u2013 a PPP project, which was awarded to Bangalore international Airport Company Limited (\\u201cBIAC\\u201d) in 2008, by the Government of India.\",\"Estimation of the potential changes in the social impacts of transitioning to circular economy for multiple stakeholdersa case of Indian transportation infrastructure sector\\nThe transition to a circular economic model in India is likely to cause some changes across the multiple sectors, including transportation, energy, waste management, and water and other natural resources.

They find that unbundleing transmission increases efficiency but reduces welfare, especially in regions with high-voltage transmission, where the cost advantage of load-serving entities over independent power producers in accessing the system is large. The authors find a significant welfare gain to unbinding if the unbonding cost is 1% of total cost, with gains to load from a lower cost system and to generators from access to new customers.\",\"Governance issues in BOT based PPP infrastructure projects in India: a critical analysis from a legal perspective\\nAbstract\\nInfrastructure projects are being considered as one of the key drivers of Indian development and the private sector has been given a major role in infrastructure development in the country by means of Public Private Partnerships (PPP). However, the recent experience from India shows that PPP projects have been fraught with several issues and problems and in most cases the projects were not delivered on time, within budget and to specification. The present paper is an attempt to critically analyse some of these issues, and identify the reasons for them. In addition, it seeks to analyse the current legislative\\u002flegislative framework available in respect of BOD based infrastructure PPP in order to identify some gaps in this legal\\u002finstitutional framework which are likely to cause problems during implementation of infrastructure project and also to suggest some measures\\u002fremedies to overcome those problems.\\nThis paper has two sections.

The study aims to identify factors that affect the delivery of infrastructure development projects. In addition, the research aims at identifying the factors affecting the duration of such projects, in order to help government and policy makers in the development of an effective policy. A structured questionnaire was developed and sent to 50 experts. Experts were also asked to provide inputs on the questionnaire in three stages. After the first stage, 40 responses were received. This was followed by a second stage where 20 experts were interviewed for validation. 10 of these responses have been excluded for analysis. Delphi technique was used to obtain the remaining 60 responses. It was found that lack of coordination is the single most important factor affecting delay in project implementation. Other factors identified as important were poor project appraisal, poor planning, lack in human resources, inadequate project management, financial crisis, and lack or insufficient monitoring\\u002f evaluation.\",\"Role of knowledge infrastructure capabilities in knowledge management systems implementation: evidence from Indian higher education\\n-\\nFecha2016-12-06\\nPalabras claveSistemas de gesti\\u00f3n de conocimiento\\nResumenThe purpose of this exploratory case study of the University of Pune, India was to analyze its institutional culture and identify the role of Knowledge Infrastructure Capabilities (KIC) in the successful implementation of a Knowledge Management System.

This paper analyses how governance mechanisms have been used to structure PPPs to facilitate their success and the relationship between the institutional and structural mechanisms and project performance. It examines the PPP arrangements in 13 large-scale road projects across India from 2000 to 2010. The study found that there was no direct relationship with the governance arrangements and their influence on project success; rather, the success of PPP projects depended on the quality of the contracts, project design, and government commitment and oversight. In addition, it found a relationship that is not expected with governance structure and contract structure, namely, that PPP infrastructure contracts are generally more complex and more expensive than non-PPPs. As such, government intervention and control over PPP contracts and projects are required and are the key to success in PPP): 4 ()\\nPages: 549-566:4\",\"Experimental games for developing institutional capacity to manage common water infrastructure in India\\nAuthor\\nMukesh, A.\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nImpact\\nAbstract\\nWater is a common pool resource in many parts of India, where the institutional framework and capacity is weak. This paper investigates the role that games might have in strengthening institutional frameworks in this context, by designing experimental games to assess the impact of a range of institutional measures. We test the effects of different types of water governance on the performance of common infrastructures by conducting an experiment in 10 rural water and sanitation schemes. The experimental design allows us to estimate the effect of governance types on a variety of measures such as water availability, cost, quality and quantity of service. Our results suggest that, when water is managed by a self-help group, water supply and service quality are better, while cost and water quantity are worse. When water management is through a panchayat, service quantity, supply costs and quality of services\",\"The work of waste: inside India's infraeconomy by Arunima Sinha\\nThe waste that India generates is a treasure trove of valuable resources.

In this study, we analyze the time overrun and its various dimensions in 25 mega infrastructural projects. Our analysis is based on a data of 3,200 mega projects undertaken over a period of more than 50 years since 1961. The findings suggest that there is a wide range of delay in infrastructure delivery across various mega-projects and the projects with higher delay also tend to cost more and vice-versa. We found that the cost over-run is directly proportional to the delay. Further, the analysis suggests that project size, project complexity as well as project location and climate are important factors for project cost and time-overrun.\\nNo References\\n No References declared.\",\"Availability of infrastructure and manpower for primary health centers in a district in Andhra Pradesh, India\\nAbstract.\\nDOI: 10.1590\\u002fS0041-87812008000050008\",\"Evolution of Financing Needs in Indian Infrastructure Industry\\nBy Suresh Reddy\\nIndia is a country with a population of over 1.3 billion people which is growing rapidly.

A sample of 1,000 schools is covered from five states. Data is collected by means of a specially designed school questionnaire and by using an asset index for each school. This paper assess the impact of public school expansion on access to education for poor children in the five selected States. The study finds that private aided schools have much better physical facilities, including more teachers and more textbooks. They also charge higher tuition fees and the quality of education appears to be higher. It is also found that the cost structure of private schools makes them vulnerable to fluctuations in their financial inflows. Finally, it is argued here that, despite the higher quality and lower costs of the private sector\",\"Nonlinearity between infrastructure inequality and growth: Evidence from India\\nAbstractIndia is the 11th most unequal developed economy, and it is also an under-performing economy in terms of growth. The authors find that there are three sources of this underperformance. First is underinvestment in infrastructure. They show that the infrastructure investment gap, which is estimated as a ratio of infrastructure to GDP, explains about one-fourth of the growth gap between India and the average growth of advanced economies from 1960 to 2012. Second is an infrastructure quality gap which, they say, may explain as much as 25% of India's growth performance. Third, infrastructure is a significant impediment to the country'S potential for growth as measured by the output per capita.

Using a vector error-correction method, we investigate the role of infrastructure in the growth of output in different regions of India, and the contribution of the different components of capital input to the output of different infrastructure sectors. Our findings reveal that the elasticity of growth in infrastructure to its output is higher for capital and less so for labor. We find that there is a strong positive relationship between growth rates of regional GDP and infrastructure. Further, the regional differences in infrastructural inputs for a given level of GDP indicate that infrastructure is not equally important for every sector in all the regions. This finding is particularly true for the power sector; in fact, infrastructure investment in this sector is much less important in certain states. In contrast, there seems to be a significant and positive role for infrastructure for manufacturing and agriculture. These two sectors are more capital intensive in nature, indicating\",\"Investigating degenerated peripheralization in urban India: The case of water supply infrastructure and urban governance in Chennai\\nThis article investigates the processes and politics through which the water and sewerage system in the metropolitan city of Chennai, South India, has evolved into one of the most expensive and least accessible urban services in Tamil Nadu.

We use the Census of Manufacturing Industries in India to study the determinants of location and capital structure, as well as the effects of regional differences in infrastructure quality on industrial location. The results confirm that there is a relationship of causation between infrastructure investment and industrial growth. However, there does not seem to be any direct relationship in terms of a positive impact on manufacturing employment. Furthermore, it seems to imply that the quality of roads is the most significant determinant of industrial development. Finally, we also show that infrastructure has a strong impact in reducing the level of environmental pollution generated. This implies that investment in roads may be a more efficient way of improving the environment rather than investment to improve the efficiency of production: 111\",\"Creating machine readable men: legitimizing the 'Aadhaar' mega e-infrastructure project in India\\nThe paper analyses the Aadhar mega infrastructure project that the Government of India launched in 2008, in order to develop a national database of citizens that could be used for a range of purposes from providing identity documents to accessing social assistance programmes. The paper looks at the technical specifications of the project, the governance structure of its creation, and finally the ways in which the Indian government used these technological infrastructures and their social implications. It examines the implications for the everyday lives of people who have been involved in the construction of this infrastructure and its uses. In doing so, it highlights the extent to which this mega-project can be seen as an extension of a broader eGovernance agenda that has been promoted by the government since 1999.\\n- Author\\u002fEditor\\n-.\",\"Infrastructure development and economic growth: Prospects and perspective from India\\nIn this paper we discuss how infrastructure development affects the growth of an economy using an augmented Solow (1987) productivity growth model. We consider the effects of three important dimensions of infrastructure - physical, human-related and institutional \\u2013 as well as the interactions and feedbacks among them. The model is then applied to India, where the recent growth performance is very poor, with the GDP per capita growth rate declining in the 2000s. Results suggest that in order to achieve the average growth rates experienced by the Asian Tiger Economies during the past three decades, India would need to spend an additional 5.5 % of its GDP on infrastructural development.\\n- Dosi, Giovanni & Faure, Jean-Louis, 1994. \\\"The Structure of Economic Systems: A Survey of the Recent Research,\\\" Journal of Evolutionary Economics, Springer, vol., September. Full\",\"Policy dimensions of development and financing of water infrastructure: The cases of China and India\\nIn the context of rising water stress in many countries, the role of infrastructure for water management and its financing is becoming more important. However, there are still many challenges to overcome. This paper discusses the policy dimensions for the financing and development of (urban) water infrastructures. It is shown that the two countries China, which is currently undergoing a rapid transition from state- to market-led water sector development, and the emerging economy of India, face similar challenges. The paper first reviews the existing literature in the water policy domain. Second, it discusses how water policies have evolved in China over the past decade and what policy instruments have been used. Then, India is presented as an emerging market for urban water utilities and water supply companies. Finally, conclusions are drawn and suggestions for further research given.\",\"The impact of regional infrastructure investment in India: Evidence from the power sector\\nThis study examines the impact that regional power infrastructure investments have had on growth and other outcomes in Indian states. It focuses on the investments in grid and non-grid infrastructure, as well as on their impact on electricity consumption, agricultural growth, and poverty. The results show that infrastructure spending has a positive effect on per household electricity demand. Infrastructure investments also have a strong impact in terms of their multiplier effect, both in the electricity sector, which is the focus of the analysis, but also on agricultural productivity and rural poverty reduction. These results are consistent with the notion that electricity generation, in turn, leads to the creation of productive uses of labour and thus increases economic activity.\\nThe study concludes that investment on energy infrastructure can improve the living standards of people in rural areas, while generating employment in urban areas. This has been achieved by a significant increase in agricultural output and a decline in poverty levels. Overall, the benefits of these investments outweigh the costs, even if one considers\",\"Infrastructure-production system dynamics in national and regional systems: An econometric study of the Indian economy from 1981 to 2001\\nWe study the dynamic interactions between a production system \\u2013 in this case, the production systems of India\\u2019s 29 states -- and the supporting infrastructure system. Our approach is based on using the state level panel data of annual time series data from the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) for the period 1 January 1991 - 31 December 2017 of which 22 years are available for analysis. We use a set of production functions based mainly on the theory of technical change to analyse the long term trends in the productivity of these systems. For this, we use the Hodrick-Prescott filter to decompose the annual growth rate of per capita GDP into the components of aggregate productivity and its components in terms of labour and capital. In our empirical analysis we take the states as our units and look at the growth in productivity in each of them, as well as their growth different\",\"Infrastructure and city competitiveness in India 2008\\nThe present paper aims to analyse the role of various components of infrastructure in city and state competitiveness. A panel data set consisting of 36 Indian cities from 1995 to 2010 is used to examine the impact of physical infrastructure, economic infrastructure and social infrastructure on city competiveness using the gravity model. It was found that economic and physical infrastructures play a significant role in improving state and intercity competitiveness whereas social and economic infrastructures do not have a strong impact. Furthermore, inter-city and intra-state competition is also found to have an impact on urban competitiveness of the cities.\\n- Koopman, Robert J. & van den Berg.G -J., 1985.

This paper examines the impact of the quality of transport infrastructure, and electricity generation capacity on the growth of per capita income in 12 South Asian countries using annual time series data. The paper first estimates the effects of different components of capital stocks on economic growth and then examines how much of these effects can be explained by infrastructure. A structural model is used to identify the relative importance of each component of growth-infrastructure and the other factors such as labour, land, human capital and capital. It is found that the infrastructure stock explains a significant portion of economic performance: on average 22 percent of annual real GDP growth over the last three decades can attributed to infrastructure and 14 percent to the stock of physical capital in the economy. These findings indicate that developing Asian economies can improve their growth performance through better infrastructure development.\\n- R.

It accounts for nearly 70 percent of the GDP. The government spends a major part of its revenues on Interest payment and Debt servicing. This is because of a very large public debt, which is about 60 percent - 65 percent. Of the 5 percent, 3.6 percent is the share of Debt service.\\nInterest Payment and debt servicing have grown by 4 percent and 8 percent respectively every year. Debt and Interest payments constitute an average of 15 percent share in the total budgetary allocation of all Ministries. 20 percent budget is earmarked for Interest Payment. In 1993, Debt Service and interest payments together accounted for less than 2 percent expenditure. As the economy has grown and the government has increased the amount spent on interest payment\",\"Public infrastructure, location of private schools and primary school attainment in an emerging economy\\nAbstract\\nA large body of empirical studies has established that the location, quality and accessibility of schools affect students\\u2019 learning outcomes. However, few studies explore the impact of public infrastructure on private school choice and school quality. Using a unique dataset with a detailed geographic information system for the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, this study estimates the effect of infrastructure development around private and public schools on the probability of students achieving the minimum level of primary schooling. In addition, it investigates how the infrastructure around schools may influence the quality of the private education offered. This paper shows that students living in low-infrastructure areas are 2.1 times more likely to drop out of school. Moreover, the presence of higher education infrastructure is negatively related to enrolment in private primary schools. The proximity to public primary, secondary and tertiary education facilities also influences schooling outcomes, especially in terms of dropout rates in public and private private schooling and enrolments in primary education.\\nKeywords\",\"Enhancing ICT infrastructure in public services: Factors influencing mobile government (m-government) adoption in India\\n- Publisher:\\neScholarship, 2016.\\nThe Government of India, in 2006, introduced the concept of m-Government as part of its Digital India program to make public sector services more citizen-centric and accessible. This has been a key driver for the adoption of mobile services for government and has resulted in the development of an ICT-based platform, which provides a host of services to citizens. These services include payment of utility bills, filing of income tax, passport and other applications to government authorities, etc. The adoption has increased from 2.6 million in FY2013 to 8.5 million citizens in June 16. However, there is a wide gap between mGovernment adoption, and its usage and benefits to the citizens, especially in rural areas of the country.

For this purpose, a comparative approach is adopted in which data from the South Asia and East Asia Survey of Public Service Motivation (2007\\u201308), which includes a survey of 1,700 civil servants in Korea and India, are used. The findings show that the level of public service motivation varies between the agencies. In contrast to the public sector, the motivation of Indian irrigation staff appears to depend much more on their own initiative, and is therefore less affected by the motivational level in their department, which in turn is affected negatively by promotions. Korean irrigation department staff are more likely to be motivated by their pay and to have been transferred to another agency than Indian staff in a similar category. This suggests that in Korean public organisations, there is less of a tendency to promote staff within their agency, whereas in Indian organisations the\",\"Infrastructure development in India is at a critical juncture.

It examines DFIs role in the infrastructure value chain from the perspective of infrastructure funding in Brazil and India.\\nThe paper argues that DFEs can play key role as catalysts of economic growth in developing countries through infrastructure financing. This can be done by providing financial guarantees or by directly funding the construction of projects. DFAs provide financial guarantee to private and public investors for financing infrastructure projects in a country where there is lack of institutional financing or a weak credit rating system. In addition, the paper shows that infrastructure investment can create employment and increase productivity. The paper also suggests ways of promoting infrastructure in Nigeria in order for the country to benefit from such projects as is the case with China and South Korea.

It examines the extent to which infrastructure investment is an important determinant of growth at state level. The analysis shows that states which invest more in physical infrastructures are likely to see higher rates of economic growth, but that the impact of infrastructure on economic development is not uniform across states, with some states being more responsive than others to infrastructure-induced growth. Further, the analysis reveals that infrastructure investments are more likely in states whose growth rates have been higher, indicating a \\\"catalytic\\\" effect. In the absence of a strong catalytic effect, investments in infrastructure are not sufficient to induce growth and that a higher level of investment would be required.

This study analyzes the investment decisions and the capacity development of India's airport operators in post privatization era in order to ascertain the impact of privatizing and regulating the Indian air cargo industry. The study also examines the effects of macroeconomic factors on the airport investment in India over the period of 1995 -2010. Using co-integration and error correction modeling approaches, the study examines various determinants of airport capacity and investment by airport operator and identifies the factors responsible for the growth in airport investments in this period. Further, we also identify the sources and magnitude of the macro factors that affect the airline industry and in turn affect airport capacities and investments. We find that the privatized airports are more likely to invest in their infrastructure and increase capacity in response to economic growth.

It is difficult in such areas to get immunization for children under the universal immunization programme. A study of immunizing facilities and immunization status of children of slum dwellers of Kolkata has been undertaken to determine the availability and accessibility of such facilities. Materials and methods: The study population included 3000 mothers (50% males and 50 % females) of age 0-5 years from 12 slams of 6 wards of North, South and Central Kolkata. All the mothers of these children were interviewed to collect data. Immunization status was also ascertained through the immunisation cards of all the children. Results: Out of a total population of approximately one lakh slummers, only 25% of them had access to health facilities available under universal immunizations programme, 10-25 %. The immunization coverage was low. In the slam\",\"Does a higher level of infrastructure increase population in large agglomerations? Evidence from India\\nThis paper provides evidence on the relationship between infrastructure and population growth in aglomerations (cities) in India. Using a panel of 36 Indian cities for 1981-2001, and a fixed effects panel approach, we find that increases in the number of roads per km2 lead to a significant increase in population per sq km in both rural and urban areas; the effect is stronger in rural areas. Increases in power and water supply per capita lead, on average, to population increases of about 0.2 and 1.5 per annum respectively. These findings are robust to various robustness checks.\\nS.Suresh & V.Krishna, 2004. \\\"The effect of public infrastructure on economic growth: Evidence for developing countries,\\\" Applied Economics, Taylor &\\\\; Francis Journals, vol.34(13), pages 1497-1503.

The transformation of the industrial sector from a labor-intensive one to a capital and technology intensive sector is underway. With this shift, the role of ICT has become important for the growth of industrial efficiency and productivity, and in reducing inefficiencies that arise from the fragmentation of physical infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a two-sector model and examine the effect of infrastructure and ICT on productivity in both the services and manufacturing sectors. Using the data of manufacturing and services sectors for years 1998-2000, for a panel of 30 industrial clusters and a control group of non-industrial clusters, our results show that the productivity growth in manufacturing is positively associated with the development of road and power infrastructure in the manufacturing clusters whereas, in case of services sector, both infrastructure development and use of technology increases the level of productivity. We find that ICT infrastructure\",\"An empirical investigation of the link between infrastructure development and poverty reduction: The case of India\\nDate2019-05\\nAuthor\\nBajaj, Anjali\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThis dissertation empirically investigates the causal effects of infrastructural development on poverty in India. Using a unique panel data set of 1,000 Indian states, over the period 1993 to 2010, I investigate the effect of various types of infrastructure and their combination with the level of poverty on household consumption and expenditure. I find that infrastructurally developed states have lower poverty rates than the infrastructually underdeveloped states. This suggests that poverty can be reduced by developing infrastructure. Infrastructure, particularly roads, has a significant positive effect on income generation and hence has an impact on the poverty level. The results also indicate that the impact of road infrastructure is stronger than that of irrigation infrastructure in reducing poverty. However, the results show that irrigation and power infrastructures do not have any significant impact. In addition, while there are significant gender differences in the effects,\",\"Sewage disposal in the Musi-River, India: water quality remediation through irrigation infrastructure\\n- Cite\\nM. A.

The rural households in this study are selected from a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 households that is representative of India's rural population. Banking outreach is defined as the number of branches per 1000 people residing in a district. It is found that a 10% increase in the banking coverage in districts leads to a higher probability of having a formal bank account for the households. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that banking services are complementary. However, the study also reveals a significant impact of branch density on formal savings. These savings are found to be positively correlated with branch densities as well as with banking penetration in rural India.\",\"Promoting low carbon transport in India: NMT Infrastructure in India: Investment, policy and design strategies\\nThe transport sector plays an important role in the economy and in people's everyday lives. India is the world' fourth largest country by area with a population of 1.2 billion (2011) which is expected to increase by 30% and 50 million new motor vehicles by the year 2030, according to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways of India. As such, there is a pressing need for sustainable infrastructure and transport systems to support and promote long term social and economic growth.\\nIn the context of this growing need, this study will analyse and develop policy recommendations for a low-carbon transport strategy that will be applicable to India' s urban and regional transport sectors. This project will also assess the impact of climate change on the current infrastructure stock and future infrastructure investment needs. Finally, it will develop and recommend policy guidelines that are necessary to reduce the carbon emissions in both urban areas and the road transport infrastructure sectors, by developing the\",\"Integrating spatial development with infrastructure provision along an envisioned transport corridor: A conceptual framework and its application to India\\nDate2006\\nAuthor\\nBhattacharya, B.\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nIn recent times, infrastructure sector has been a key driver of economic growth in India.

In the long run, a higher level of K c would be required, which may be achieved by the government through the implementation of appropriate policy.\",\"Publicprivate partnership infrastructure development in India: The case of water and sanitation sector\\nWater and Sanitation (WASH), in the Indian context, has been an area where public infrastructure has played an important role. The Government of India, since its Independence, had set up public sector companies for the development of this sector through various publicprivate partnerships. However, the performance of public private partnerships in this sub-sector was not satisfactory for various reasons, and hence, there was a need to explore private sector participation in WASH sector. In recent years, private participation has taken a different shape in water sector in terms of new models, which can be broadly categorized as PublicPrivate Partnership - Build & Operate and Public Private Partnership-Transfer. Both these models have different implications for government and private partners, but the success of PPP depends on a number of factors like availability of suitable project, availability\\u002fcost of finance, political will, regulatory and institutional issues in both government \",\"Design of smart roads-a vision on indian smart infrastructure development\\nSmart Road\\nIn the era of information and technology where the world is getting smarter day by day, it is a great vision to make our transport system smarter and more technologically advanced. This would not only make the journey of the people safe and easier but will also give them access to a wide array of services and facilities. It will provide them with better and faster transportation facilities to reach their desired destination.\\nA Smart Road is also known as smart highway is an advanced version of traditional roads. These roads use the latest advanced technology for the transportation of vehicles, which are based on the principle of communication, connectivity and control. A smart road is designed to meet the requirements of a large number of cars travelling to various locations at the same time. Some of its features include,\\n- Communication and connectivity with other devices like smartphones, computers and vehicles. The roads are fitted with sensors that can sense the presence of other vehicles and also provide information in real time about the traffic\",\"Impact of ISO 9000 on organizational climate: Strategic change management experience of an Indian organization\\nAbstract\\nThe ISO9001: 2000 is the most important and significant tool for quality management system, which is used by many organizations around the world. ISO standards help to improve organizational performance. There is no doubt about the fact that ISO can bring about a radical change in the way an organization functions. The ISO is also known as a strategic tool that can be used as an organizational change agent in order to create a change and transformation in an organisation. However in recent times there has been a decline in use of this tool. In this paper, we have tried to understand the reasons for the decline, in spite of all the success stories and the various benefits which it can provide. We have also tried in this study to identify the factors which are responsible for this decline.\\nKeywords\\nISO 14000; ISO standard\\nDOI:\\nUniversity of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine in Iasi\",\"Underpricing of infrastructure IPOs: evidence from India\\nAbstractThe: 1094-1102\\nContact details of provider:\\nWeb page: and\\nRelated researchKeywords: India; infrastructure; IPO; market; overp;:109.\",\"Greening Ahmedabadcreating a resilient Indian city using a green infrastructure approach to investment in urban development.\\nWhat is Greening Ahmded?\\nGreen.\",\"Issues in promoting rural infrastructure in India\\nThis paper is about the issues in rural development, particularly in terms of rural connectivity and infrastructure.

It examines the impact of a new infrastructure policy on the location of new industries, particularly in the case of South Indian industrial zones. The paper also examines two new economic policy zones to explore the nature of infrastructure that is created to support industrial growth. These zones are identified and located on a map of India to highlight the extent to which new zones support the creation of industrial infrastructure. Finally, the role of hope and anticipation on location choices is examined. We show that anticipation is not a sufficient condition for location. This conclusion is based on evidence from the two zones examined in this study.\",\"Growth and Non-Traded Sectors: The Scope of India's Infrastructure\\nAbstractThis paper studies the determinants of infrastructure development, using data on the growth of the economy and the stock of non-traded infrastructure in India. We find that non tradeable infrastructure has a negative impact on economic growth and that the impact has been increasing over the post-1990 period, suggesting that policy makers have not fully taken advantage of economies of scale in infrastructure creation. The results also suggest that, over this period of time, the government sector has not been particularly effective at building infrastructure and it has had a limited impact in promoting economic: 1-13\\nReferences\\nThis work and.\",\"perspectives of ergonomics research at defence institute of physiology and allied sciences in india\\nDate2017-05-31\\nAuthor\\nPuri, Anju\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nErgonomics is an integral part of human factor which is defined as, \\\"the science of designing and arranging things in the environment so that people can perform their jobs effectively\\\".

The recent turn to financial markets to finance infrastructure projects has resulted in a proliferation of new financial instruments such as Public Private Partnerships, Public-Private Partnership Bonds, Social Investment Bonds and Special Purpose Entities. These new financing mechanisms and financial intermediaries such the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank have been used to attract public funds and mobilize private investment through the use of innovative financial structures. However, these new mechanisms have not been accompanied with the political reforms which would allow for the development of a public infrastructure market. This paper explores the implications of this turn, focusing specifically on three countries: India, Kenya and Colombia. It draws on case studies to explore the ways in which the financial turn has affected the politics of infrastructure and public debt.

In this paper, a review of the existing risk management models available in the literature for infrastructure sector is carried out and their relevance, in practice, is highlighted by the authors. This review is based on a case study conducted to study a water supply infrastructure project and to assess the risk associated there with. The authors have tried to identify the most appropriate risk assessment techniques and tools available for risk identification and evaluation, risk allocation and monitoring of risk for the project in question, which were then used in risk mitigation measures.\\nThe paper highlights the need of developing a risk profile of a project as early as possible during the planning phase to help project management and the stakeholders in better planning. Further the author's have attempted to develop a suitable risk monitoring plan for their project, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques in conjunction with an appropriate information\",\"Rethinking dispute resolution in publicprivate partnerships for infrastructure development in India\\nThe public-private partnership (PPP) model, a form of contractual arrangement for the delivery of infrastructure services through the private sector is increasingly used to finance infrastructure in developing countries. Despite its popularity, there is limited empirical evidence on the performance of PPPs in terms of their ability to deliver high-quality infrastructure and services and achieve development goals. A review of existing studies indicates that the PPP model has not always delivered the promised outcomes of highquality infrastructures, reduced costs, enhanced efficiency, and increased service availability. This study aims to identify the factors that may be constraining the ability of the public and private sectors to achieve these objectives through PPP in the context of India. The study examines the nature and causes of disputes in PPP agreements, their impact on PPP outcomes, the role of dispute settlement procedures in reducing the impact of these disputes and its effect on outcomes. Finally, this study identifies the main factors constrapping disputes resolution mechanisms in Indian public infrastructure projects\",\"Appraisal of WaSH (Water-Sanitation-Hygiene) infrastructure using a composite index, spatial algorithms and sociodemographic correlates in rural India\\nDate2015\\nAuthor\\nMukherjee, Shilpi\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nAccess to a safe supply of drinking water is critical to ensure health, hygiene and overall well-being of a human. In rural areas, water scarcity has resulted in increased reliance on unprotected sources of water supply, leading to the spread of various water-related diseases. This paper assesses the status of safe drinking-water sources and sanitation coverage in the selected areas using secondary sources. It also explores the spatial patterns of these facilities and the socio-demographic variables of the area. The study also examines the association of WASH infrastructure facilities with the health status, socio-economic status and environmental variables. Using a spatial analysis, the study finds that the overall coverage of potable water facilities in India has increased from 57.5% in 1990 to 85.3% today. However, there are still large pockets of India\",\"Transforming the nation's logistics infrastructure with 'intelligent' technology.\\nAerospace and Defense\\nInfrastructure\\nManufacturing\\nLogistics\\nAutomotive Manufacturing\\nHealthcare\\nRetail and Consumer Goods\\nOil and Gas\\nUtilities and Energy\\nTechnology\\nEducation\\nGovernment Services\\nFinancial Services and Insurance\\nTransport and Logistics\\nPublic Sector\\nThe world is becoming more complex with each passing day.

The financial health assessment of the projects can be conducted by using a number of methods, some of them are: traditional debt to equity ratio, debt coverage ratio, interest coverage, return on equity, and profitability ratio etc. However, all these methods have their own shortcomings. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive model is developed based on the stochastic simulation technique to assess the financial risks of a highway project. An example model of an investment based highway PPP project is used to analyse the effectiveness of this model by simulating the project for a period of fifteen years.

We also investigate the effects of crude price, Real GDP and interest rate changes on India's Inflation rate. To achieve the purpose, Structural VAR method is adopted. The results indicate that there is an unidirectional and negative relationship among crude, interest rates and real economic output. Also we have found that an increase in real interest leads to the growth of Inflation. Moreover, the results also confirm the fact that inflationary expectations play an important role in inflation and output growth, and the effect is stronger for inflation in India. Therefore, a decrease in the real rate of interest and a rise in oil prices are the two major factors behind inflation: 109-119\\nReferences listed on IDEAS\\nPlease report citation or reference errors to, or |.\",\"economic liberalization and indian economic growth: what's the evidence?\\nThis study is the first one to provide a rigorous analysis of the relationship between Indian trade reforms and economic performance. It uses a new data set on India, based on trade data at the sector, state and firm levels, covering all sectors and the entire economy. The results reveal that while Indian manufacturing has grown relatively fast after the reforms, there is no clear evidence that services have benefited, and that the growth rate of Indian exports has been slower after reform. These results are robust to a number of alternative measures of liberalisation.\\n- Khandwalla, P, 1991. \\\"The Effect of Trade Reforms on Exports and Economic Growth: Theory and Evidence from India,\\\" Economic Journal, Cambridge University Press, vol. and growth in developing countries : a critical analysis,\\n-.\\n-, 2008. \\n- S.

The analysis is based on a newly constructed panel of firm-level data from 1978 to 1990 for manufacturing, and 1981-1992 for services. Using a \\\"non-parametrized\\\" approach for estimating the productivity equation, a strong and statistically significant decline in the manufacturing sector is found. This decline is more pronounced and longer lasting in services, but it is not statistically different from the decline found in manufacturing. However, in a second stage of estimation, the effects of economic reform on efficiency are also estimated. In both manufacturing (for 2-digit SIC) and Services ((for the ISIC4-classification of 7-digits), the reforms are found to increase efficiency\",\"the indian economy in transition: globalization, capitalism and development (paperback).\",\"the well-being of labour in contemporary indian economy: what's active labour market policy got to do with it?\\n- Publication Type:\\n-.\",\"push or pull? drivers of female labor force participation during india's economic boom\\nThis paper investigates the relationship between the female wage premium and the level of economic development in India for the period 1979-97. We find a negative relationship for all but two of the four periods. The negative coefficient suggests that women are not pushed out of labor by rising wages or rising employment opportunities for men, nor are they pulled out by increased educational opportunities. Rather than being pushed into a job by economic growth, women appear to be pulled in because they have the opportunity to work. This is consistent with the view that economic expansion in the developing world provides the opportunities women want.

We argue that the recent increase of non-agricultural informally employed population should not be seen as a sign of worsening economic performance, as some recent studies suggest. Rather it should be interpreted in a context in which informal sector is increasingly seen to be a source for positive growth effects through the creation of new job opportunities, and its positive impact on growth in terms of productivity, income and inequality reduction is growing. Our results show that, although informal labour share is increasing in Indian economy, the positive effects on economic development of this employment growth still prevail. In order to better understand the nature of positive employment effects of informa1 employment, in this work we also provide an analysis on the employment characteristics of formal and informal sectors in rural and\",\"goods and services tax: it's impact on indian economy & the tax payers\\n- Category Business\\nThe impact of the goods and service tax on the economy of India can be analyzed by the following factors;\\nImpact on economic activities-\\nGST is an indirect tax levied on goods (except alcohol and tobacco) and is a consumption tax. It is paid by consumers at the point of final consumption, and thus the burden does not fall entirely on producers. This makes it easier for the government to collect.\\nAs an effect, it reduces tax evasion, since tax collection is not based on physical delivery. Also, as it is levying on a product rather than a person, there are more chances of it being collected. However, the collection of GST is also dependent on how well the administration of tax works. If the system is corrupt, tax avoidance is quite possible. Hence, GST may not be as good for tax revenue\",\"exports and economic growth in india: an empirical investigation\\nThis paper analyzes the relationship between exports and GDP, by applying the ARDL model.

We find evidence of structural break in India's real trade balances in both the short-term and long-terms. A break appears to be associated with the introduction of economic reforms in 1991 and also with a rise in oil prices during the mid-1990s. These results imply that the sustainability hypothesis that has been used to argue for liberalization in other developing countries is not applicable to India. The results also suggest that trade liberalizations, such as the WTO negotiations, may have been delayed because of concerns about the long run sustainability (2008)\\n- New Economics Papers: this issue\\nMore about this item\\nKeywordspopulation; trade; unit roots; cointegration; structural Breaks;\\nStatisticsAccess\",\"the stunted structural transformation of the indian economy: agriculture, manufacturing and the rural non-farm sector 2017 by a\\nAgricultural development and rural development. 3.1 Agriculture and agricultural growth. agriculture is the backbone of rural and.\\nThe indian agricultural sector is a key driver of national and sub-national economies. in india agriculture contributes to more than half of gdp, employs more\\n2019-12-16 \\u00b7 agriculture sector has been a major growth engine for the country\\u2019s economic growth and it remains a dominant sector for rural employment. with about 55 percent of total workforce in the sector and about one-third of all agricultural production coming from the agriculture\\nThis paper examines how the agricultural and non agricultural wage sectors are linked in china using detailed panel data from household surveys for five years (2011\\u002f2012 to...\\nIndia\\u2019 s agricultural productivity has improved over the past five decades. this has helped in sustaining a high economic rate growth, while simultaneously\",\"role of women entrepreneurship in indian economy. 1.0 Introduction.\\n1) Role of entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurship plays very important role in economy because it helps in development of a country and also provides employment to many unemployed people so it is very essential.

In order to achieve this objective, various data series such as GDP data, inflation data etc. were used. It has been observed from the time series of GDP that the economy has faced a negative shock to growth due to various reasons. However the effect due the negative shocks has not been significant. The analysis also showed that a rise in inflation has led to a reduction in economic activity in India. Thus in order not to face the impact of negative growth shocks and to increase the rate of growth in the near future, the government has to reduce the level of inflation in a sustainable manner. Further it has also been noticed that India has experienced negative external shocks.

However, the government should not be blamed for rising prices. This is because inflation will cause a rise in prices for most consumers and will thus reduce the purchasing power. Inflation is one important tool for monetary policy in a country and its impact is a vital area of investigation for economists and policy makers. A rise or fall in inflation is the change in the level of overall prices, which is measured in terms of a basket of goods and services.

These are the reasons for the rupees fall, but the question which arises is why has the dollar appreciated. Is the appreciation a result of higher demand and supply of currencies. The answer is not quite correct, for it is the demand for dollars that causes appreciation of dollar and vice versa. This is because dollar is used as a benchmark for pricing commodity prices. It is therefore, the increase in demand of commodities for which the price has increased. In other words it means that there was more demand. As a currency it has its value. And the more the value of a particular currency, it will be more attractive for foreign investors and traders. So as we know that the higher the values the lesser is its cost\",\"agriculture role on indian economy\\nAgriculture is the backbone of Indian economics, which accounts for 19% of GDP and employs 60% percent of the working population.\\nThe agriculture sector is a large contributor to India's overall economy. It contributes 17.4% to the Indian GDP which is almost 50% higher than the world average. Agriculture contributes to 65 per cent of exports. The agriculture industry is an essential part of our economy because it provides food and raw materials to millions of people. However, there are many problems with the current agriculture system that must be fixed before India can move forward and develop as a country\\nThere are a number of factors that influence agricultural productivity, such as the quality of seeds and fertilizers available, as well as access to water and land.

The reasons for this lower standard of life are not simple and can be attributed to a combination of factors such as low human capital, a lack of access to land and credit, limited economic diversification, as well as the legacy of Indian policy and culture.

This has resulted in a very large pool of educated teachers, a situation which is likely to increase with the government' s ambitious plans to scale up primary school enrolments and reduce the drop out rate, particularly at the lower levels of education. In a country such as India, whose future depends greatly on the quality of its primary and secondary education, it is imperative that the country' 'produce a new cadre of teachers with adequate skills and knowledge base to meet the challenges of primary schooling.\",\"self-reliance to dependence in indian economic development\\n- Category\\nECONOMICS\\nThe first stage of an economic system (in the case of a developing country, as in India today) is that which depends on the external market for its raw material. During this stage, which we call the \\u2018pre-industrialisation\\u2019 stage, the economic activities are confined to production of food, fodder and furs for the market. The raw materials are drawn from the land and from other natural resources like forests, water sources and the like.\\nThis stage is also called as the primary stage because here the main concern of the people was to survive and there was very little attention to the growth and development of economic activity. This is why the level of technological development in this pre- industrial stage was at a very low level. There was a heavy dependence on nature for food and other resources.\",\"a study on demonetisation and its impact on indian economy\\nThe impact of the decision by the Government of India to demonitise high-value currency notes in November 2016 on Indian economy has been the subject of extensive discussions and analyses in the Indian media and academic circles. While there has not yet been sufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusion, a few facts and trends, based on publicly available data, suggest that the economic impact so far has largely been negative. In particular, there appears to be a sharp decline in bank deposits, and this is likely to translate into further contraction in credit to the private sector. These developments are also affecting the overall economic growth and the fiscal deficit of both the central government as well as state governments. Further, the recent decline, which was sharper than anticipated, in exports has also adversely affected foreign exchange reserves. The impact is further compounded by a rise in global oil prices. This has led to an increase in overall\",\"emergence of an industrial labour force in a dual economy-british india, 1880-1920\\nThe emergence of a large industrial workforce in British India was the most dramatic and significant feature of the economic development of South Asia at the turn of 20th century. It had an important political, social and economic impact on the region in the period. This paper examines this process of industrialisation by focusing specifically on two dimensions of it, the emergence or growth of wage labour, and the impact of that growth on rural India. The paper traces the growth in wage employment in India\\u2019s urban areas as a result of growth and expansion of industry and argues that the labour market for urban wage labourers was a product of economic processes in which the rural areas were only indirectly involved. Thus, while wage workers and urban employment were important indicators of urbanisation, it must be understood that these changes did not occur in isolation from the rest of Indian society.\\nNo Reference information available - sign in for access.\",\"the political economy of commerce: southern india 1500-1650\\nAbout\\nMap\\nContacts\\nThe Portuguese began to trade in this area and established a factory at Malacca in the Malay Peninsula. The most important commodity exported was pepper - a red, pungent spice that is produced from dried berries of the piper vine, which grows wild in many parts of Asia. In 1540, he sent a second expedition to establish trade contacts with southern India. A new era of trade with Europe was opened and the Indian Ocean became a focus of European trade and power in Asia and Africa. As a result of this change in policy, the Portuguese were able to expand their influence over a much wider area, and eventually became the dominant sea-faring power of Europe. It also meant an increase in trade opportunities for the Europeans. 1 The Portuguese established trading posts in India to gain access to spices, but it was only after the establishment of a direct maritime contact with the east that trade between Europe\",\"macroeconomic response to oil and food price shocks: a structural var approach to the indian economy.\\n- S.

In fact, according to another report, nearly one million new jobs are to be created by 2022. This is a great challenge before the Indian government because there is no way to overcome this gap.

This paper examines how firm behaviour and performance have changed during this period of rapid transition. Using data from the Business Group Survey Panel of the Reserve Bank of India, we find that firms belonging to the same group tend to be similar in terms of diversification, capital intensity and firm size. We find some evidence that the diversification behaviour of firms varies across the groups. The data also suggest that groups have responded to increased competition by increasing investment in capital goods and by diversifying into newer and more productive industries. However, despite these improvements in performance, many firms are not able to maintain their competitiveness.

However, the rapid growth of this industry has not benefited the labour force in terms of higher wages, better working conditions and job security. In fact, labour in India, as elsewhere in South Asia, remains relatively undervalued and under-employed. The current industrial and economic policies have been shaped by the dominant global market-oriented ideology. As a result, workers are often seen only in economic and political terms.

The impact is likely to be greater than in developed countries due to several factors. First, the developing countries are in a process of rapid growth and have high savings rates and hence, a higher multiplier for capital. Second, capital account liberalization has been a major factor, making the emerging economy capital accounts more transparent and stable. Third, many of the countries that have received significant capital flows also have large domestic markets, which are relatively less affected by the influx of capital from abroad.\\nKeywords:\\nForeign Investment\\nDevelopment\\nGrowth\\nEconomy\\nIndia\\nGDP.

The results show that prices are not flexible in response to changes in relative prices but are flexible with respect to real variables. Price rigidities may explain the low responsiveness of the price levels to relative price changes. There is a negative long-term relationship between relative real wages and relative relative consumer prices. This suggests the existence of downward nominal rigidity. An explanation for this is provided on the basis of an investment function for real wage determination and the assumption that nominal wages are determined in terms of relative productivity.\\nDepartment\\nDescription\\ntext\",\"what determines indian economic success?: evidence from tribal and individual indian enterprises\\nIn this paper, we investigate why tribal enterprises are more successful than individual enterprises in the Indian economy, which is characterized by a high degree of informality. We show that tribal enterprise success is driven by two main factors: the tribal identity and the social networks that are formed among tribal members. Our analysis, based on a sample of tribal firms and on the individual-level data of the NSSO Household Survey, suggests that the success of a tribal firm is a function of its members\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 social interactions. In the case of individual firms, the level of success depends on its ability to create social and business links.

A number of reasons account for this state of affairs. One, economic analyses of the Indian type, which could be used for the purpose of policy making, were not produced. There was a dearth of trained economists who could write on India. The other reason was the political economy of India which was in its formative stage. This meant that it had been the subject of much debate but had not yet crystallised as the science of economic development which it has since acquired. Finally, there has, in fact been an intellectual resistance to the study of economics in general and Indian economy in particular.\\nThe first reason\",\"colonialization of the indian economy, 1757-1900\\n- a history of western philosophy and education\\nThe Indian Economy since 1947\\nRethinking the Indian economy in the last 50 years \\u002f edited by Rajaram, D. & Kaul, R.

In the present research, we have studied and analyzed the effect of oil price volatility shocks and oil-exporting-country shocks in a dynamic setting using the Markov regression models. Our findings indicate that the oil exporters have been experiencing the volatility in oil prices as compared to that of exporters of other major commodities. The oil export economy is more vulnerable to shocks of commodity prices. We have also found that shocks to the prices of non-oil exporting countries, especially the ones with high per capita income, are significantly higher than that to oil exporting ones. Thus, the policy makers should focus more on the non oil sector.\\n- Khandelwal, Vivek & Sharma, Sanjeev, 2013. \\\"Oil shocks, oil exports and macroeconomic performance of OPEC and non OPET exporters: A panel\",\"nexus between financial inclusion and economic growth: evidence from the emerging indian economy\\nIn 2006, the United Nations (UN) declared 2015 as the International Year for Micro-credit, and as part of this initiative, a Global Consultation Meeting was held in Delhi, India.

The structural and political environment are not static, but they change over time. As such, the adjustment to a macroecological shock (an external shock) depends on the time period in which the shock occurred.\\nThis study analyzes the effects of macro-economic shocks on macroeco- nomic variables and macro adjustments for the period 1950-1999 in India. This time frame was selected due to the availability of data. Macro variables were analyzed in the form of their deviations. These deviations were decomposed into its three components-real exchange rate, price level, GDP, in order to identify its source. A structural break model is employed to detect the turning points and to estimate the parameters.

We also examine the contribution of each sector to the total output growth during the recent period. The model provides an explanation for the uneven distribution of income within the country and among different regions. While the share of agriculture in total employment has been declining, in terms of output contribution it has remained constant. In addition, while agricultural productivity has risen, output share in agriculture has declined. It is also observed from the model that the manufacturing sub-sector has contributed the maximum to both growth and employment in India. Among regions, Maharashtra has emerged as the most productive state in both absolute and relative terms in all the years since the early 1960s, with Tamil Nadu second.\\nBibliographical Information:\\nAdvisor:Majumder, S.C.; Gh\",\"demonetisation 2016 and its impact on indian economy and taxation\\nDemonetisation is a step toward the elimination of black money.

The objective behind the decision to demonitize notes of Rs. 500 and Rs 1000 was to curb the practice of Black Money.\\nThe decision of demonisation was taken after long discussions and deliberations in the parliament. In fact the idea of bringing black economy into the tax net was a vision of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had spoken about it even before his election and has been working for its successful implementation since his first tenure. But the implementation of this vision had become a matter of great debate. There were strong voices opposing it as it would affect the daily transactions of people. However, the PM and his team was convinced about its benefits. Finally the government took the bold step of making the move a reality.

The growth of industrial production and commercial activity, the expansion of foreign trade, and above all, agricultural transformation, are seen as fundamental in the process. This chapter will examine some issues involved in interpreting the nature and significance of these trends. These issues arise out of a consideration of their social context: the changing structure of society and of class relations, in particular. It will be argued that these transformations are best seen both as consequences and as agents of change in India, which in turn is best interpreted as an integral part of nineteenth and twentieth- century capitalism.\",\"international migration, remittances and its macroeconomic impact on indian economy, foreign exchange reserves of india, the impact of indian remittance on economic growth.\\nInternational migration or international immigration is the migration of people across international borders or within international boundaries [1][2] (including migration between different administrative units such as counties, provinces, and municipalities), and can involve.

It argues that India's agriculture has been characterised by a \\u201cdual technological structure\\u201d - a combination of imported and indigenous technologies. In spite of significant state intervention in agriculture, this dual structure remained intact. The article traces the emergence of this structure and its consequences. A new model of agricultural development, based largely on imported technologies, was introduced from the early 1960s. However, the state continued to play a crucial role in the development of the agricultural extension system, which promoted the adoption of new technologies by small farmers. This model proved incapable of providing a sustainable development path, however, as it was based on an unsustainable pattern of production which relied heavily on external inputs. As a result, by the mid-1990, India had become highly vulnerable to international fluctuations in agricultural prices\",\"impact of demonetisation on indian economy: a critical study - free download as pdf file (.pdf), text file\\na study on effects of the demonitization and it's effects on the\\nindia is the second largest gold producer in the world after south africa. 2.1 impact of gold prices on gold mining. in india the major producers are the... 3.4.3 impact on employment in (a) mining of metals & minerals, \\u2026 4\\nimpact\\nthe impact crusher range is ideal for shaping applications including making chips, sand, concrete manufacture, and glass recycling. the range includes both horizontal and vertical impact crushers. horizontal impact\\ngold mining in south sudan | gold production 2019 \\u2014 knoema\\nsouth sudans production of 0.9t in december 2008, was worth $7.7m at average gold sales of usd 8.5\\u002foz, according to the\",\" process, infrastructure, and system quality as resilient strategies to respond to COVID19 pandemic challenges: Evidence from higher educational institutions in India.\\n\\n1\\n, \\n2\\n\\n\\u2013\\n4\\n\\n,\\n5\\n\\n).\\nThe purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the existing research, which has explored the impact of COVID\\u201019 on the educational sector, particularly in the context of higher education systems in developing countries, with a focus on resilience, the challenges faced and coping strategies adopted.

Inflationary Effect of Oil Price Shocks: The oil shock of1973 and the oil shocks of1980 and 1988 had a significant impact on the economy both in terms of short term and long term impact. In 1974, the price of a barrel of crude oil was around $6. This price increase was due to oil exporting countries raising their prices to the United States to help pay for its war in Vietnam.

In spite of its rapid economic growth, the unemployment problem of India is a major concern in the recent times. The Indian unemployment rates are high and rising despite the fact that the economy has expanded by more and more employment opportunities. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to study the relationship between economic and employment growth in India, in an effort to ascertain the factors that are responsible for the increase in unemployment in Indian labour force and the impact of these factors on India\\u2019s economy.\\nThe study uses a panel data set of 20 Indian states to investigate the determinants of unemployment, and it also studies the effect of economic activity and government\\u2019 policy initiatives on the growth of employment, during a period of time from 1981 to 2007.

This is the main reason why the number of SMEs in India has increased over the years. [11] In India, the growth of Small and Micro Enterprises can be linked to the development of a number a small scale industries. As a result, they can also help in reducing the unemployment level as it provides more employment opportunities to many. The government of India is also working on the policy of encouraging SMEs through various programs. It is believed that if the SMEs grow, then India will develop faster and more efficiently. SMEs provide the employment in the unorganized and informal manufacturing sector. Small scale sector is not only providing jobs but it also provides employment to millions of people who can earn their livelihood from this sector and this is very important for a developing nation like India.

Explain this view'\\nAns:\\nThe Indian economy has been in the process of a gradual transition from a planned to a market economy - a shift from command to competition. This is the most significant and important change that has transformed the economy in a post-independence period. The process is gradual as the Indian state is still the dominant force in determining the direction of the economic policy, and the state remains the major employer in both the public and private sector. As the transition takes place the market and state continue to operate in parallel, but with increasing convergence. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between the two and also to appreciate the differences between them as this will help in understanding their respective roles and functions.. For example, the government continues to intervene in markets for the sake of price stability, to promote\",\"economic reforms in india since 1991: has gradualism worked?\\nEconomic reform since liberalisation has been slow in India. The country has made some significant progress, yet the country\\u2019s economy is still in a mess. This article discusses the economic reforms since the liberalisations.\\nThe liberalizations in 1987 and 2013 brought many changes to the economy of India and it has had an effect on the Indian economy in the past 3 decades. In 1972 the Congress government introduced a five-year development plan and this led to increased industrialization and urbanization of the nation. However, this plan was not enough to solve the problems facing the society and economy. So the second liberalization, which took place in January 2021 was necessary. There have been several changes in economic activities since then, including privatization. But there are still many problems in terms of economic growth. It has not been able to increase the standard of living of its citizenry. Moreover, it\",\"twenty-first century india: population, economy, human development, and the environment\\nAbout India's Future :\\nIndia is now in the process of making the transition into a twenty- first century economy in a world economy. This transition is being driven by a number of factors, among which are rapid growth, the increasing integration of the Indian economy into the world and regional economy and trade, a large number and a rising percentage of young people, increasing urbanization, rapidly increasing energy consumption, climate change and its impacts (especially on agriculture), an expanding transport infrastructure, growing environmental issues in all sectors, including agriculture, water, forests and energy generation, rising demand for energy, especially by the poor \\u2014 who also have the most to lose from climate impacts, gender issues related to poverty and environment, demographic trends,and the need for greater equity and justice within the country.\\nThe Indian government\\u2019s approach to development has been guided by an overarching philosophy of development \\u201c that is pro- poor, pro growth and\",\"cultural values in india's economic development\\nServices\\nThe Indian society has its own culture and traditions. 2. The economic growth rate of India is higher as compared to the other countries of the world. India' s development has not been a smooth or a straight process. In 1979, the government of Prime Minister Morarji Desai passed the Land Acquisition Act, which provided for a fair compensation to people who were dispossessed of their land. It was not until 1942 that the first Indian economist was appointed to serve in the Reserve Bank as a consulting economist. This is also a major factor in hindering the overall growth of Indian companies, as most of them are owned and run by families. A major economic issue that is affecting India today is their growing population. One is that it is a country of many ethnic groups each with their own language and culture.

This paper examines why this is so. We argue that two factors are most important: the rapid increase in India's stock of knowledge - the result of an educational investment programme that was begun in 1973 [1] and the adoption in that same year of a'market friendly' macro-economic policy. These two features have led to rapid growth of the manufacturing sector, and with this growth has come a rise in productivity and a substantial increase is labour skills. The second part of this paper discusses the implications of these developments for a race-relations theory of economic development. Our analysis of Indian data indicates that the increase of India in economic performance and labour productivity has taken place at the expense of labour and income shares of China. While this suggests that India is not on a similar path to East Asia, the data also indicate that,\",\"does financial development increase ruralurban income inequality? cointegration analysis in the case of indian economy\\nThis paper analyses the role of financial sector development on the growth of income distribution in a small open economy.

In India the electoral winner, the Indian National Congress (INC), and its allies, have a strong presence in a large number of districts. We use an original data set from the 2004 and 2014 elections which includes information on the location and composition of voters and of candidates. By comparing the spatial structure of the distribution of violence and votes, we show that the pattern of vote allocation to the INC in these states is not uniform and differs between elections, but also that it is more concentrated around the districts with higher INC support.

It also investigates if these perceptions differ depending on whether communities are members of the dominant Aruna tribe, the indigenous Gaddi tribe or the Bodo tribe. We argue that the nature of perceptions differs for communities that are differentially located on the same land. Using 24 in-depth interviews of people from all three communities, as well as 11 focus group discussions, we found that communities differed in their attitudes depending whether or not members were from the Arna tribe; Arunas are more likely to be supportive of infrastructure. This is because the project has direct benefits for the community. In contrast, Gadis and Bodos are less supportive and more opposed to the development. However, Bodes are also likely beneficiaries of this infrastructure as a\",\"extended phillips curve for the indian economy\\nExtended Phillip Curve \\u2022The extended philipl curve shows the relationship between wage level and unemployment.

In particular this study aims to identify the impact of micro financing on income generation and poverty reduction of households. For this purpose, a regression model for the poverty status of a household is estimated. A two-stage least squares estimation procedure is used to test the hypothesis.

A government collapse would also mean the end of all the reforms that have taken place in recent years and an immediate return of protectionism and cronyism. If this is avoided the second scenario, which is not as bad as the first one, may emerge. Under this scenario the current government may survive, but its ability to push through the needed structural reforms may be severely\",\"indian economy: essays on money and finance\\nThe Indian economy is the fastest growing in the world. It accounts for about five percent of global GDP and its growth has made it the fifth largest economy in nominal terms. The economy has experienced a high growth of about 8.5 percent for the last two decades, and has maintained this pace even during the global recession of 2009.

The analysis suggests that growth is determined by long run factors, such as capital, labour, physical capital and total factor productivity. In the analysis, the authors have used the standard longrun relationship of Solow (1957) with a Cobb-Douglas production function. A long term growth model has been developed to capture the effect of longterm investment and growth. Convergence between the states is also tested with standard statistical tests.

We analyze the conditions for a switch between a low- and a high-price fuel, which is motivated by the introduction of a second fuel into an otherwise fuel-monopoly economy in order to achieve an inter- fuel substitution, and we discuss its possible effects on welfare in an oligopolistic context. Our main result is that the model predicts a reduction of total consumption and of the share of high price fuel for low income households. However, for high income groups the substitution reduces total fuel consumption but it increases the shares of both fuels. The model also shows that fuel switching can be beneficial if it is preceded by a price increase. Finally, in contrast to the previous literature, we prove that in a monopoly the second price of oil and gas can increase welfare: 127-137\\nReferences listed on IDEAS\\nPlease report citation or reference errors to, or (\",\"the reunion of the church, revised edition: a defence of the south india scheme of church polity \\u2013 (bible commentaries) by c.s. johnstone \\u2014\\nIn the last few days of December I had the pleasure of reading The Reunion of The Church.

These are the main reasons why a country like China is growing so rapidly - the government can afford to invest huge amounts in its infrastructure and can borrow cheaply because it has a large number of savers.

This is not surprising, since export-oriented firms face the pressure of having to compete with international firms on quality, which is a necessary precondition for exporting. Moreover, export firms also tend to be large, as the export market is large. In addition, firms in the non- exporting group tend not to export because they cannot compete against foreign firms.

The authors find that the effects are highly concentrated: while there exist several policies which have had a positive effect on growth during the past three decades, others have clearly worked in the opposite direction. A large number of policies have been tried and discarded. The main policy conclusions are that, although the government's fiscal deficit did play an important role in promoting economic activity, its impact was limited. On the other hand, a well-targeted, pro-poor expenditure program can have a very significant impact, particularly when it complements private capital flows. This finding is especially important, since there is currently a tendency in many developing countries, especially in South Asia, to advocate a \\\"privatization\\\" of social and economic policy, as a means of\",\"The challenge to governance in India has emerged from three major sources.\\nThe first is the failure of the political class to deliver. The second is that there has been an erosion of civil society institutions. And, the third is a decline in the quality of our democratic institutions and processes.

There is an increasing feeling of despair, cynicism and disillusionment among large segments of society with regard to the future of democracy and the polity in general.

Using state-level data covering the pre-liberalization and post-liberization periods for major crops, the study examines whether the benefits of liberalizations in terms of higher growth and employment are being fully realized by different states or if they are concentrated in particular regions. We find that the growth of gross value added (GVA) per worker is significantly associated with agricultural reform measures, implying that agricultural growth is being stimulated by policy reforms; however, it is not uniform across states. This is corroborated by the results of the regression of GVA per farmer on agricultural reforms, which show that reforms have not significantly increased the productivity of farmers. The results are robust to the inclusion of state dummies in different regressions. In general, agricultural policies in India have been more liberalized in states with relatively higher levels of industrial\",\"a study on the impact of fdi inflows on exports and growth of an economy: evidence from the context of indian economy\\nAbstract\\nThis study aims to empirically examine whether and how FDI inflow impacts on export and on GDP.

In this paper we examine if the changes in stock index have an impact on real GDP (GDP growth). The study uses quarterly data over the period 1994-99 for 12 countries. The result is that there is a negative relationship, meaning that an increase in the stock price increases the real gross domestic product. There are two possible interpretations of these results. One is the fact that stock prices have a leading role in real economic activity. Second, there might be a lag in economic activities.

GNSS is a technology that provides highly accurate position and time information to the users and the military. The GNSSL - based positioning system provides accurate location information within centimetre level of precision over a large area within minutes of time, which is critical for navigation. In addition, GNSPL also helps to track the movements of objects within its range. Since GNPS is based on radio signals it can be easily jammed, disabled or destroyed.\\nThe research work is to review the current GNSA capabilities of the country and assess the impact in case of any GNPA\\u002fGNPS failure on the operational capabilities and its potential impact on India.

This vision has been largely supported by US allies and allies-in-arms in Europe, North America and Asia. But the US-India alliance has become a test case for this vision in recent times. The two countries are seen by many as natural partners in the quest for global liberalism, with their shared values of democracy, pluralism and secularism underpinning their respective visions.

It also discusses the political and social factors that contributed to the emergence of insurgency in Northeast, and the nature of counter-insurgency, which, according to some accounts, is even more ruthless and indiscriminate than the conflict itself.

Finally, these products should be deployed in the market with the right marketing techniques.

The Gujarat riot was a major turning point in the Indian security establishment as it led to significant changes in defence policy and reforms. While it is widely acknowledged that post the Gujarat violence the government of India took a more proactive approach towards defence planning, the manner in which it has been implemented remains a matter of debate and criticism. This paper examines the nature of post \\u2013 Gujarat reforms and highlights the limitations of the reforms that have emerged.

In the 1987 Defence Review, Australia committed to a 1:6 ratio of defence spending to GDP and a goal to be among the first 15 countries in terms of the relative share of military personnel to the size of our population. Since then the Australian public have been prepared to accept the expenditure of 2% of GDP on defence to maintain a level of force capability commensurate with regional security challenges (as measured by the White Papers of successive Defence Ministers) and the need to contribute a proportionate level to Australia'a'security partners' in Asia.

India'a indenigenizing efforts began in the mid-1950s with the formation of the Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) and the Indian Ordance Department. However, these entities were primarily intended as research and development organizations rather than as manufacturing entities. It was only following a 1974 Cabinet resolution that OFB began manufacturing. Over the decades, the program has been a significant contributor to the development of a domestic defense industry in addition to providing critical capabilities to India. The thesis will examine the current state of indegneous production and how the indgenous program\",\"personal protective ensemble reference size development for indian male defence personnel based on 3d whole body anthropometric scan data\\nAuthor\\nDate2010-09\\nPermanent Link\\nThis document has been peer-reviewed.

The DDP is the most important defence procurement procedure and the main document which governs the defence acquisition process. The Defence Procurement Manual 2013 : A Guide for Procurers is a compendium of the policies and guidelines relating to defence procurements by the Ministry of Defence. Defence acquisition is responsible for procurement of various items required for military operations. This is done by procuring these items from the Indian private sector and foreign suppliers. Procurement of items through this process is also done through the Defence Public sector undertakings. In the recent years, India\\u2019s defence forces have been facing severe shortages of a variety of weapon systems and platforms. These shortages are not only because of inadequate production in the private and public sector industries, but also because there are a lot of procedural bottlenecks. It is in this context that the\",\"10 indo-russian defence cooperation and india's independence and sovereignty.\\n2018.\",\"india-china defence cooperation and military engagement...\\nIndia-China defence engagement in the new century\\nChina -India relations: A road map\\nThe Chinese and Indian economies are the fastest growing in Asia.\\nThey are also the most populous, largest and richest countries in that\\nregion.

It has been a long time since they got any significant upgrade in their equipment and weapons. There are several reasons for this. Firstly and most importantly, we are a country where there is a lot of corruption and mismanagement, which results in very low budgets and low equipment. Secondly, there are very few countries which are willing to sell us their advanced weaponry. Finally, even when we can buy weapon, our country does not give enough attention to defence.\\nWe can see that we have a serious problem with the Indian defence forces, and we should all do something about it. Our country needs a strong defence, as our neighbours and friends are all building up their armies and navy.

The question whether it is really necessary for the defence of a country like India or the funds could be used for other development purposes like health, education etc. has been debated for a long time. It also needs to be looked at in the light of its effect on economic development of this country. Defence expenditure has grown at a fast pace, from 2.5% of GNP in 1960 to 7.9% in FY 2006-07. In the last decade, the ratio of defence expenditure to the GDP has increased from an average of 5.8 per cent in pre-reform period (1971-75) to an all time high of around 6.6 percent in recent years.

However, the defense industry has been considered to be a strategic sector, and therefore, a significant barrier has remained in the way of foreign investments. This has not only hindered growth of Indian defense manufacturing sector but has created a gap in technology and capabilities in comparison with the developed countries.

This programme was first announced in 1940, by the then prime minister of Independent India, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. The aim was to make India totally self-reliant on the manufacture of defense products and systems. It was a very ambitious plan, as at that time, there were no manufacturing industries for defense goods in India. In 1957, the programme became a law in parliament. Since then, this law and many others have enabled the government and armed forces to procure defense equipment from India-based industries. However, since India is a big country, with a large population, and with many different regions, climates and terrains, it is difficult to equip all parts of the nation equally.

It is concerned with the changing nature of British intelligence activities within the Indian empire. At the end of World War 1, Britain was in possession of one of its largest overseas territories.

The result was a series of events, which have come to be known as the 'Rajput Scandal'. The Rajput scandal was the first serious crisis of imperial authority in British India.

In the first 30 years of bilateral relations, Australia had been a major provider of military assistance to India, particularly following Independence in 1947. However, after 1972, when India's relations with the USA were normalised, the bilateral military ties began to deteriorate as Australia became a close ally of the US and its military links with India diminished.

In the 1950s and 60s, India's defence requirements were supplied by indigenous manufacturers such as the Aircraft Factory at Nasik. This will enable India to build its own defence infrastructure and capabilities, rather relying on the foreign suppliers for the entire spectrum of military requirements. It was also felt that in the long term, such an arrangement with Russia would enable Indian firms to acquire the requisite technology to produce sophisticated weaponry.

The annotated data set consists of a set of defense related articles which are classified as positive\\u002fnegative and a manually curated corpus based from a corpus mining tool. These two corpora are further used for building the semantic annotated corporal for use in a machine learning algorithm for developing an accurate classifier.

It is an industry which is not only self-reliance, but which has also emerged as a significant player in both the domestic as well as the international arena.\\nIn order to achieve the goal of self reliant industrial development and to promote industrial growth and development the Indian Government introduced several industrial and fiscal reforms from 1991. The main objectives of these reforms were\\na) To create an atmosphere conducive to private enterprise and private entrepreneurship. b) to attract foreign investment and technology and c) the creation of a competitive domestic environment. These objectives were achieved through de-licensing, liberalisation, privatisation and the reduction of fiscal deficits. All these were implemented in a phased manner and in 2009\\u002f11 India was rated the 9th most preferred destination by foreign investors.

India is on the threshold of an economic transition where economic growth will accelerate to the next level. The country also stands poised to take a leadership role in global growth for the first time in its history.\\nWhile it is true that India has become a much stronger defence and strategic partner to several nations, its defence budget is still very small when compared to that of the US, Russia and China. It is therefore important that this is seen as a long-term goal, and not a short-cut. A larger defence outgo will not only have a negative impact on economic prospects but also on social and political goals of national development. This will also impact the country' s ability to meet its foreign aid commitments.

The study was based on secondary data from the Economic Survey from 1950-51 to 2011-12..\\n1.1 Introduction\\nIn the contemporary era \\u2018defense spending\\u2019 has been a matter of serious debate. While some argue that defense spending should increase to keep up with the ever increasing threat of terrorism, others believe that spending more on defense can be counterproductive and lead to a situation where defense budget is used for purposes other than defence like development of infrastructure etc. and the economy is not benefited.\\nDefence spending is also a source of concern for many developing countries like India, which has to balance the need for modernization of its military to meet the rising security challenges posed by China and Pakistan. It has a huge population and its defence forces are one of the largest in the world. However, the country has had a history of\",\"india's tortuous road to defence-industrial self-reliance - a journey in four parts (part i)\\nPart I\\nIndia has been a \\u201cstrategic pivot\\u201d \\u2014 an important part of US military plans in Asia-Pacific.

The study uses a panel data analysis with fixed effects model. Using the panel dataset of 1995-2013, the findings of this study provide support for the \\u2018crowding out\\u2019 effect of defence expenditure (i.e., the negative impact that increased defence budget has on the private sector). This means that a 1% increase in defence spend reduces per capita income by 0.1%. This relationship is found for both India, and for Pakistan, even though the former has higher economic output. Further, this result is robust to different sample specifications and estimation techniques. This result holds for all the sub-periods and all specifications examined.

Hegde\\n\\u201cThe first of the three volumes is an edited collection of essays by the editor, Dr Rajesh Hejde, on a wide range of subjects relating to India\\u2019s security, its defence forces and its foreign policy. This collection is a valuable contribution to the field of strategic studies. It is particularly valuable for the fact that it deals with the military aspects of India in a comprehensive manner, and also for its critical examination of many aspects in which India has been engaged. The essays have been written at various points of time in the author\\u2019 s career.\\nThis first volume contains essays that have appeared over the period between 2008 and 2015. These are the years when the\",\"indian defence industry: an agenda for making in india\\nThe Indian Defence Industry has come a long away from the times when it was considered as an afterthought. The Indian Government is now giving it priority, by setting up the Defence Acquisition Council in 2001, and has made a series of policy announcements and measures in the last decade which have helped the industry. However, much more can be done for it, in terms of making India self-reliant, which will not only save valuable foreign exchange, but also make the country\\u2019s military more potent. This is especially so in view of the growing strategic competition with China and its allies, as well as the continuing terrorist threat from across the border in Jammu and Kashmir. A strong defence industrial base is the only way to meet the threats of today.\\nIndian Defence Industrial Policy\\nIn India, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) controls the procurement process.

This is done with the help of a detailed analysis of some 300 references to the \\u201cdefence expenditure\\u201d and allied matters. The data are arranged according to time, topic, author and source. These data and the analysis are presented for the period 1860-1947.\\nA number of conclusions and observations, in general, are drawn from the survey. One is that there is little agreement among the authors as to how the defence budget should be measured. Some have taken the budget estimates of defence ministries, whereas others have used the estimates made by various agencies. There is no unanimity on how these budgets should reflect the reality of military preparedness, the actual expenditure on the army and other forces, and their relative importance to other sectors and services in the economy. Secondly,\",\"strengthening the growth of indian defence by harnessing nanotechnology-a prospective approach\\nThe Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), the largest defence research organization in Asia, and one of the top ten organizations of its kind in the world, is the prime organisation responsible for all research and development activities in India relating to defence.\\nNanotechnology, the next big thing, which has been the buzz word in many of scientific conferences in 2011, can be used to improve the defence capabilities of nations worldwide. The technology can offer a variety of possibilities in improving the efficiency of weapons systems and enhancing the performance and capabilities to the armed forces. Nanotechnology can help enhance the lethality of conventional weapons and improve their accuracy. It can aid in making the weapons lighter and more durable. Nano technologies can also be helpful in developing stealth capabilities and can reduce the cost of weapon systems. These are some of many ways in which nanotechonology can improve conventional weaponry. In this context, DRDO has identified\",\"covid-19's national security and defence lessons: key takeaways for australia and india from this year' s 'global go'\\nThe covid- 19 pandemic has had a major effect on global geopolitics over the past twelve months, with the United States and its allies being at loggerheads with China on issues ranging from trade to human rights to technology.\\nBut in the coming decade, the pandemic will likely have its own effect. It is clear that the covid has highlighted some of the world' nations' - most notably the US \\u2013 weaknesses and exposed its fragility in many areas. As a result, some countries have already taken steps to address those weaknesses, while other countries will need time to make those adjustments.
