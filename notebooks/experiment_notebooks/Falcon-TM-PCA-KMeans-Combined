sustainability of trade deficits in the presence of endogenous structural breaks: evidence from the indian economy, 1979-2007\\nAbstractWe examine how sustainable are the trade balance deficits of the Indian economy using the standard unit root test and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. We find evidence of structural break in India's real trade balances in both the short-term and long-terms. A break appears to be associated with the introduction of economic reforms in 1991 and also with a rise in oil prices during the mid-1990s. These results imply that the sustainability hypothesis that has been used to argue for liberalization in other developing countries is not applicable to India. The results also suggest that trade liberalizations, such as the WTO negotiations, may have been delayed because of concerns about the long run sustainability (2008)\\n- New Economics Papers: this issue\\nMore about this item\\nKeywordspopulation; trade; unit roots; cointegration; structural Breaks;\\nStatisticsAccess\",\"the twin-deficit hypothesis: revisiting indian economy in a nonlinear framework. In the present study, we use the new nonlinear time-series analysis tools to revisit Indian economy with new time series data. We find that there are two distinct periods (pre-1991 and post- 1990) in the Indian economic history, one with high real output and low growth and the other with higher growth but lower real growth. The Indian real economy experienced two different structural changes in two decades. There is a clear shift in Indian macroeconomic policies during this period.\",\"the indian gaming regulatory act and its effects on american indian economic development the indian gambling regulatory - the effects of indian casino gambling on the economic the impact of the introduction of gambling casinos by tribal governments is analyzed the\\nthe effects gambling, the negative effects and impacts of alcohol and drug abuse 3 the positive effects 4 the costs of abuse and treatment 5 what you can do\\nalcohol and gambling addiction 1 alcohol is an addictive substance 2 alcohol affects the brain 6 the long term effects are severe 7 alcohol can cause a wide\\na new report shows that the gambling industry is worth $1 billion to the economy each year \\u2014 that's more than the combined output of australian mining and the country' s\\nfind out why gambling is so destructive and what it can cost you and your family and community\\ni've been asked by a lot of friends what i think about the legalization of casino-style gambling in washington state i'll try to make it brief (as brief as can be on\",\"financial inclusion and growth of indian economy: an empirical analysis\\nAbout the project\\nThis research project aims at investigating the linkage between financial inclusion in India and the growth rate of the Indian economy for the period 1995-16. Using a cointegrated VAR model, results from this study indicate that financial deepening in the economy has a significant positive impact on real GDP, which has improved over time.\\nThe results also indicate the existence of a long term relationship between real financial depth and real output in both the short term and long run. Further results indicate financial development to have had a positive effect in reducing the volatility of Indian output and to a small extent in curbing the variability of inflation. Financial depth has also had some influence in increasing the rate at which the real per capita income increased. This study also finds evidence of financial develoment in contributing positively to the reduction of unemployment. The results of this research also find some support for a '\",\"Gig Platforms as Faux Infrastructure: A Case Study of Women Beauty Workers in India\\nThe gig economy is growing at a dizzying pace in the Global South. In response, many companies have adopted a business strategy that relies on the use of platforms to connect with a workforce \\u2014 often in low-wage countries. These platforms are often touted as a means of providing workers with flexibility and economic opportunities, while also providing flexibility for employers to access workers inexpensively.\\nDespite the many promises and hype around gig work, we have yet to see a significant amount of research on this topic that is conducted from the perspective of women\\u2019s work and its intersections with gender, class, caste, race, and ability.

The analysis of this paper is based on the assumption that the access of rural households to banking and microfinance institutions can improve the living conditions of poor households by providing them with financial services. In particular this study aims to identify the impact of micro financing on income generation and poverty reduction of households. For this purpose, a regression model for the poverty status of a household is estimated. A two-stage least squares estimation procedure is used to test the hypothesis. Empirical results reveal that access and use of financial service by poor farmers has positive and significant impact on their income and on household poverty. Further, the results indicate that for each 10 percentage point increase in the number of banks in a district \\u002f village, household per capita income increases by 0.03 \\u2013 \",\"the rise and growth of economic nationalism in india: economic policies of indian national leadership, 1880-1905\\nThe Rise and Growth of Economic Nationalism in India Economic Policies of Indian Nationalist Leadership,1889-1947 Economic nationalism is a political and economic theory which emphasizes national economic development and self-sufficiency in order to achieve political independence.

GST is a tax on goods and services. A negative tax is the opposite to an income tax, where the government collects less revenue by allowing for deductions and exemptions. However, in 1972, the then PM of India, Mrs Indira Gandhi introduced a uniform national tax that brought together the state taxes into one national levy. The GST will also ensure the tax collection is uniform across all States and that the same rate is applied to each commodity. It will be the world\\u2019s largest tax reform since World War 2.

The raw materials are drawn from the land and from other natural resources like forests, water sources and the like.\\nThis stage is also called as the primary stage because here the main concern of the people was to survive and there was very little attention to the growth and development of economic activity.

Using state-level data covering the pre-liberalization and post-liberization periods for major crops, the study examines whether the benefits of liberalizations in terms of higher growth and employment are being fully realized by different states or if they are concentrated in particular regions. We find that the growth of gross value added (GVA) per worker is significantly associated with agricultural reform measures, implying that agricultural growth is being stimulated by policy reforms; however, it is not uniform across states. This is corroborated by the results of the regression of GVA per farmer on agricultural reforms, which show that reforms have not significantly increased the productivity of farmers. The results are robust to the inclusion of state dummies in different regressions.

Our main result is that the model predicts a reduction of total consumption and of the share of high price fuel for low income households. However, for high income groups the substitution reduces total fuel consumption but it increases the shares of both fuels. The model also shows that fuel switching can be beneficial if it is preceded by a price increase.

In a nutshell, it\\u2019s a piece of code which automatically executes when certain conditions are met. It\\u2019ll perform actions automatically (pay a sum of money, for instance) without a human to intervene. This makes the smart agreement extremely cost effective and efficient. Smart-Contracts were introduced by the Bitcoin blockchain as a way to execute transactions automatically. Since then, the concept of smart agreements has been expanded into different fields like healthcare and education. A typical example is the application of blockchain in the healthcare sector for the purpose of sharing health related data between multiple stakeholders. The blockchain has the potential to transform a large range of industries\",\"the marginal rate of saving in the indian economy\\nThe Indian economy is in its nascent stages of economic development.

In other words, its growth has been very fast in last 5 decades, but in real terms, it is not so much because of the population growth rate.

To deal with the problem, in October\",\"indian economic reforms: a stocktaking\\nAbstract:\\nThis paper assesses the impact of the economic liberalization and structural adjustments programmes in India, with special reference to agriculture. It is argued that in spite of many setbacks, there has been significant progress. The reforms, although incomplete, have been a success in terms of increasing output and employment. A major constraint to the success of economic reform, however, has not been lack of progress, but rather the political resistance of those who benefit from the current system of patronage. This resistance is now weakening, which is a positive sign for future growth and development prospects in the country.\\nThere are no comments yet on this publication.

The intestinal mucosal barrier is essential for maintaining a balance between the host and the microbial community. However, chronic colonic inflammation has been linked to the development of ulceration, a pathological state of colons that is accompanied by the loss of epithelial cells. Colonic ulcerations are a common complication of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and are frequently accompanied in IBDs. Ulcerations in the large intestine are associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species. These reactive species may be a potential contributor to ulcer formation in inflammatory diseases, such as IBD and colite, because these conditions are accompanied with chronic oxidative and inflammatory status.

The findings indicate that a positive, significant and increasing relationship exists between energy usage and productivity for the entire Indian economy. In addition, the relationship between the energy use and output is found to be more significant in case -of manufacturing sectors than in primary sector, while for both manufacturing and primary sectors it is negative at the early stage of development, but turns positive after a lag of 3-5 years.

It argues that the political significance of both groups is underestimated in the literature and that their interests are likely to play an important role in shaping India's political future. The paper first discusses the origins and characteristics of the UMCs as a social group in India. It then examines recent trends in household income distribution and consumption in order to assess whether the middle- and -upper middle \\u2013 classes have grown in importance in recent decades, and how they are distributed across the country. Next, it examines how the growth of these groups affected the nature of political competition and conflict, in particular the rise of caste-based and class- oriented politics.

The present interpretation is confined to the Indian case, which may be considered a typical case in its social, economic and institutional structure. It was a colonial society, with one group of colonisers - the Portuguese who arrived there first, followed by the Dutch and the English, who succeeded the former and finally by British -- with the later two sharing a common language (English) and religion. In this context we may try to interpret social structure through four broad parameters.

In order to achieve this objective, various data series such as GDP data, inflation data etc. were used. It has been observed from the time series of GDP that the economy has faced a negative shock to growth due to various reasons. However the effect due the negative shocks has not been significant. The analysis also showed that a rise in inflation has led to a reduction in economic activity in India. Thus in order not to face the impact of negative growth shocks and to increase the rate of growth in the near future, the government has to reduce the level of inflation in a sustainable manner. Further it has also been noticed that India has experienced negative external shocks.

This has led to the rise of the Indian PE investment market. The investment in the PE sector in 2014 rose by 20.6%, with $2.4 billion invested in India. With the new PE regulations in place, the amount has been growing, with the number of PE firms also increasing. However, there are still many PE funds in need of funds.\\nIndian economy\\nWhat are the key challenges in making a PE fund investment? In addition to a good investment portfolio, private fund investors also need a strong management track record. In particular, these funds must be capable of raising sufficient capital from both foreign and domestic investors. Moreover, Indian private funds should have a proven track history. If the fund has a trackrecord, it is worth a try.

India\\u2019s economy depends very much of a highly skilled workforce but at the same time has a shortage of highly educated and skilled manpower. According to the latest report released by ManpowerGroup, India needs nearly 10 million skilled people. However, the government is unable to meet the demands of this skilled labour market. In fact, according to another report, nearly one million new jobs are to be created by 2022. This is a great challenge before the Indian government because there is no way to overcome this gap. So, we can say that in India, there exists a skills paradox.\\nReasons Behind the Shortage\\nThe first reason why India lacks a skilled work force is that the country\\u2019 education system does not produce enough skilled and educated labour.

In this paper we examine if the changes in stock index have an impact on real GDP (GDP growth). The study uses quarterly data over the period 1994-99 for 12 countries. The result is that there is a negative relationship, meaning that an increase in the stock price increases the real gross domestic product. There are two possible interpretations of these results. One is the fact that stock prices have a leading role in real economic activity. Second, there might be a lag in economic activities.

It is an attempt to review the growth process of an underdeveloped economy, which has been the most dynamic in the developing world over the last two decades. The first chapter of the revised edition gives an overview of economic development since the preIndependence period. Chapter II discusses the various phases of growth, based on the experience of different states in India. These phases have been broadly described as preindependence, pre-liberalisation \\u002f prereform and post-reforms. Chapters III and IV describe the nature and structure of agriculture and the services sector respectively. It also discusses their contribution in economic output in terms of share and growth rates. While Chapter III covers the agriculture sector, Chapter IV describes the performance of services during the period of liberalisation and reforms of 1991. In Chapter V, the author discusses\",\"American Indian students' perceptions of racial climate, multicultural support services, and ethnic fraud at a predominantly white university\\nAbstract\\nThe purpose of this descriptive correlational study was to describe the perceptions regarding multicultural services of American Indian college students at one public university in the Southwest United States.

This paper examines why this is so. We argue that two factors are most important: the rapid increase in India's stock of knowledge - the result of an educational investment programme that was begun in 1973 [1] and the adoption in that same year of a'market friendly' macro-economic policy. These two features have led to rapid growth of the manufacturing sector, and with this growth has come a rise in productivity and a substantial increase is labour skills. The second part of this paper discusses the implications of these developments for a race-relations theory of economic development. Our analysis of Indian data indicates that the increase of India in economic performance and labour productivity has taken place at the expense of labour and income shares of China. While this suggests that India is not on a similar path to East Asia, the data also indicate that,\",\"yield spread as a lead indicator of real economic activity: an empirical exercise on the indian economy,\\u201d (2013).\\n[9] See, for example, Gagnon et al. 2005.\\n2\\nReferences\\nBergemann, D. et. al., 1982.

The results indicate that there is an unidirectional and negative relationship among crude, interest rates and real economic output. Also we have found that an increase in real interest leads to the growth of Inflation. Moreover, the results also confirm the fact that inflationary expectations play an important role in inflation and output growth, and the effect is stronger for inflation in India.

In recent years, Indian growth has become increasingly dependent on demand factors.\\nThe main factors of the current slowdown were the following:\\n- The growth rates of capital formation and private and public consumption were significantly weaker than previously expected;\\nindia\\u2019s economy\\nThis is due to a slowdown in private investment, in particular in the infrastructure sector; in turn, a decline in investment led to the growth of industrial production and the production of intermediate goods. The decline also affected the demand for energy and intermediate raw materials, which led (at the same time) to lower exports, lower investment and consumption of households. At the macroeconomic level, the slowdown was exacerbated by the negative impact of global developments. For example, exports were negatively affected, and investment by foreign. This was due in part to an increase in protectionism, especially in \\u2013 in this case the countries of\",\"how budget deficit and current account deficit are interrelated in indian economy. also explain the relationship between current deficit \\u002f current surpluses and exchange rates.\\n1 Answer | Add Yours\\nDefining the difference between the current accounts and the balance of payments is the first step in understanding the connection between them. The current balance refers to the sum of the transactions that occur in a particular period of time, whereas an accounts balance is a summary of all transactions of a country during a specific time period. When there is more money leaving a nation than coming in, that is called a current deficits. It occurs when there are more imports than exports. A current surplus, on the contrary, refers that exports of any good are greater in amount than the imports of that good. Current surfeit is when the country imports less than it exports and there exists a positive balance. These differences in the accounts lead to differences between countries in international trade.

We estimate the effect of manufacturing investment using the method of least squares and the instrumental variable methods. The panel data method estimates an aggregate production function for manufacturing. Our results show that investment has a significant effect on productivity for Indian manufacturing firms. This implies that there is room for investment to increase productivity of the manufacturing sector in India, provided the government and local authorities do their part to encourage investment in this sector.\\nDocument Type: Research Article\\nDOI:\\nAffiliations: Department of Economics and Finance, University of Northumbria Business School, London Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 8ST, United Kingdom\\nPublication date: October 1, 2005\",\"the indian soft-furred rat, millardia meltada, a new host for nippostrongylus brasiliensis, showng androgen-dependent sex difference in intestinal mucosal defence\\n- Affiliations:\\n-.\",\"widening economic & social disparities: implications for india 2.1 introduction : 'the.

The growth of industrial production and commercial activity, the expansion of foreign trade, and above all, agricultural transformation, are seen as fundamental in the process. This chapter will examine some issues involved in interpreting the nature and significance of these trends. These issues arise out of a consideration of their social context: the changing structure of society and of class relations, in particular. It will be argued that these transformations are best seen both as consequences and as agents of change in India, which in turn is best interpreted as an integral part of nineteenth and twentieth- century capitalism.\",\"footloose labour: working in india's informal economy\\nFootl.

It was not until 1942 that the first Indian economist was appointed to serve in the Reserve Bank as a consulting economist. This is also a major factor in hindering the overall growth of Indian companies, as most of them are owned and run by families.

The country is moving ahead towards a knowledge-based society. It is also moving towards the globalization and liberalized economy, which will require a skilled and educated workforce. In this context, India is experiencing a major challenge to provide the much needed employment to its growing population, especially in agriculture. Agricultural labor is facing the problem of declining labor supply due to the changing demographic pattern of labor, changing attitude to work and increasing educational levels of rural youth. This research project has focused on the issue of agricultural labor in Indian agriculture, more specifically on how to improve the productivity of Indian agricultural workforce, and how the cooperative movement can contribute to it.\\nThis research\",\"sustainable production of solar electricity with particular reference to the indian economy.\",\"structural change and economic growth in india\\nAbout\\nContacts\\nThe structural change has been brought about by the growth rate of GDP, growth of manufacturing, services and agriculture, the role of foreign capital, foreign direct and indirect investments, export, import, etc. The structural changes in Indian Economy are: 1.

We have used panel cointegration technique to find long-term relationship between two variables. This study finds a positive long term relationship, which indicates there is a cointegrating relationship exist between Government Size Index and GDP for the study period. Our results imply that Government expenditure is an important component of the economy and it is positively associated with the economic development of a country in the sense that the expenditure helps the development process. The results of Granger-Causality tests also support the long run and short run causal relationships. In other words, the results suggest that an increase in expenditure by the government is the result of economic and development in a given year and\",\"an analysis of price and output behavior in the indian economy: 19511973\\nDate1983\\nAuthor\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThis paper presents evidence on price adjustment in an open economy, using a vector error correction model of real output and prices for India. The results show that prices are not flexible in response to changes in relative prices but are flexible with respect to real variables. Price rigidities may explain the low responsiveness of the price levels to relative price changes. There is a negative long-term relationship between relative real wages and relative relative consumer prices. This suggests the existence of downward nominal rigidity. An explanation for this is provided on the basis of an investment function for real wage determination and the assumption that nominal wages are determined in terms of relative productivity.\\nDepartment\\nDescription\\ntext\",\"some comments on the debate on india's economic growth in the 1980s\\nIndia\\u2019s economy has grown at a very rapid rate over the last decade, but this has not been matched by the development of other areas. In the early 1990\\u2019S there was a lot of talk about India\\u2019 s development, and how India had a chance of becoming as strong as Japan. The Indian economy was growing at over 7 percent per year, it had very good exports to the USA, Europe, UK and other major markets, the Indian stock markets were doing well and foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was increasing.\\nThis all seemed very promising, until the financial crisis of the late 80\\u2019 S and early nineties hit.

It plays an instrumental role in the overall development of economy through efficient mobility of both goods and services. In this regard, the role of transport infrastructure is of paramount importance in any developing nation. The present study investigates the long-run relationship among the transport, industrial and energy variables. Using cointegration approach, a three-variable system is tested. Co-integration, vector error correction model and Granger causation test have been employed in order to investigate the causal relationship between the variables in short-term and long term. We find strong causal linkage between energy, transport and industrial variables for India. Moreover, we found a unidirectional causatory relationship from energy to industrial output and from industrial to transport output. This finding supports the hypothesis of Koop et al.

It argues that India's agriculture has been characterised by a \\u201cdual technological structure\\u201d - a combination of imported and indigenous technologies. In spite of significant state intervention in agriculture, this dual structure remained intact. The article traces the emergence of this structure and its consequences. A new model of agricultural development, based largely on imported technologies, was introduced from the early 1960s. However, the state continued to play a crucial role in the development of the agricultural extension system, which promoted the adoption of new technologies by small farmers. This model proved incapable of providing a sustainable development path, however, as it was based on an unsustainable pattern of production which relied heavily on external inputs. As a result, by the mid-1990, India had become highly vulnerable to international fluctuations in agricultural prices\",\"indian economy: essays on money and finance\\nThe Indian economy is the fastest growing in the world.

In addition, it also examines the moderating role of accounting accruals on performance and earnings quality of Indian companies listed on stock exchange. The study is a part of a large study on growth, earnings and cash flow forecasting of companies. A sample of 200 companies is drawn using secondary data for the period of five years from year 2010-2015 for testing the hypothesis. To check the effect of performance (growth and profitability) on accounting earnings, the study uses the panel data analysis. Using Ordinary Least Square [OLS] regression, this study finds that firm growth increases the accounting income and accounting quality.

We argue that the recent increase of non-agricultural informally employed population should not be seen as a sign of worsening economic performance, as some recent studies suggest. Rather it should be interpreted in a context in which informal sector is increasingly seen to be a source for positive growth effects through the creation of new job opportunities, and its positive impact on growth in terms of productivity, income and inequality reduction is growing. Our results show that, although informal labour share is increasing in Indian economy, the positive effects on economic development of this employment growth still prevail. In order to better understand the nature of positive employment effects of informa1 employment, in this work we also provide an analysis on the employment characteristics of formal and informal sectors in rural and\",\"sources of growth and inter-industry linkages in indian economy with special reference to the manufacturing sector\\nAbout\\nContacts\\nLand & Building 3% (Rs) 4% The major sources of income in India are taxes, interest 5% and dividends 12% of Gross Domestic Product.

The results indicate that macro-economic variables significantly affect stock markets in India. It is found that the macro variables, in general, positively affect the stock market. In the case of the Bombay stock exchange, GDI and NSS show significant negative relation with stock returns. GCI and GDF have significant positive relation, while the negative relationship for TBR is statistically insignificant.

A number of reasons account for this state of affairs. One, economic analyses of the Indian type, which could be used for the purpose of policy making, were not produced. There was a dearth of trained economists who could write on India. The other reason was the political economy of India which was in its formative stage. This meant that it had been the subject of much debate but had not yet crystallised as the science of economic development which it has since acquired.

Results indicate that firms which export have higher levels of productivity. This is not surprising, since export-oriented firms face the pressure of having to compete with international firms on quality, which is a necessary precondition for exporting. Moreover, export firms also tend to be large, as the export market is large. In addition, firms in the non- exporting group tend not to export because they cannot compete against foreign firms. They also do not innovate because innovation is an internal process of change that\",\"push or pull? drivers of female labor force participation during india's economic boom\\nThis paper investigates the relationship between the female wage premium and the level of economic development in India for the period 1979-97. We find a negative relationship for all but two of the four periods. The negative coefficient suggests that women are not pushed out of labor by rising wages or rising employment opportunities for men, nor are they pulled out by increased educational opportunities. Rather than being pushed into a job by economic growth, women appear to be pulled in because they have the opportunity to work. This is consistent with the view that economic expansion in the developing world provides the opportunities women want.

While there has not yet been sufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusion, a few facts and trends, based on publicly available data, suggest that the economic impact so far has largely been negative. In particular, there appears to be a sharp decline in bank deposits, and this is likely to translate into further contraction in credit to the private sector. These developments are also affecting the overall economic growth and the fiscal deficit of both the central government as well as state governments. Further, the recent decline, which was sharper than anticipated, in exports has also adversely affected foreign exchange reserves. The impact is further compounded by a rise in global oil prices.

As a result, they can also help in reducing the unemployment level as it provides more employment opportunities to many. The government of India is also working on the policy of encouraging SMEs through various programs. It is believed that if the SMEs grow, then India will develop faster and more efficiently. SMEs provide the employment in the unorganized and informal manufacturing sector.

A government collapse would also mean the end of all the reforms that have taken place in recent years and an immediate return of protectionism and cronyism. If this is avoided the second scenario, which is not as bad as the first one, may emerge. Under this scenario the current government may survive, but its ability to push through the needed structural reforms may be severely\",\"an empirical investigation on the feasibility of remanufacturing activities in the indian economy\\nDate2006\\nAuthor\\nSrinivasan, K\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nReman.\",\"impact of global economic crisis on indian economy: an analysis\\nGlobal Economic Crisis and its Impact on India. 1.

The main goal of this research is to study the impact of the level and volatility of inflation on the real exchange rate of India (IRR). In this paper we study a multi-asset portfolio of stocks and bonds, and we examine the optimal choice of weights that maximizes the risk-adjusted portfolio value. In our research, we are trying to explore the investment opportunity from the perspective of risk aversion using the expected return and standard variance as risk measures. This portfolio will consist of 30% in stocks of Indian market, 15% stocks from U.S. market and the remaining 55% will be in bonds. A large number of factors are affecting the growth of any country and India is no exception.

For this purpose, a comparative approach is adopted in which data from the South Asia and East Asia Survey of Public Service Motivation (2007\\u201308), which includes a survey of 1,700 civil servants in Korea and India, are used. The findings show that the level of public service motivation varies between the agencies. In contrast to the public sector, the motivation of Indian irrigation staff appears to depend much more on their own initiative, and is therefore less affected by the motivational level in their department, which in turn is affected negatively by promotions. Korean irrigation department staff are more likely to be motivated by their pay and to have been transferred to another agency than Indian staff in a similar category. This suggests that in Korean public organisations, there is less of a tendency to promote staff within their agency, whereas in Indian organisations the\",\"did india's economic reforms improve efficiency and productivity? a nonparametric analysis of the initial evidence from manufacturing and services\\nThe paper analyzes the evidence on the economic impact of industrial policies in India by using a new methodology that does not rely on standard productivity decompositions. The analysis is based on a newly constructed panel of firm-level data from 1978 to 1990 for manufacturing, and 1981-1992 for services. Using a \\\"non-parametrized\\\" approach for estimating the productivity equation, a strong and statistically significant decline in the manufacturing sector is found. This decline is more pronounced and longer lasting in services, but it is not statistically different from the decline found in manufacturing. However, in a second stage of estimation, the effects of economic reform on efficiency are also estimated. In both manufacturing (for 2-digit SIC) and Services ((for the ISIC4-classification of 7-digits), the reforms are found to increase efficiency\",\"metropolitisation of indian economy: lessons in urban development\\n- Type:\\n-,\\nAbstract\\nUrbanisation has been a feature of the Indian economy for centuries.

American Indians experience a lower level of living than the non-Indian population. The reasons for this lower standard of life are not simple and can be attributed to a combination of factors such as low human capital, a lack of access to land and credit, limited economic diversification, as well as the legacy of Indian policy and culture. This work uses the theory of public choice to develop a model that explains how American reservations can experience low standard living and why this is the current situation.\\n- Kuk, Hyung-Joon (Author)\\n-.\",\"on the dynamics of energy consumption, co emissions and economic growth: evidence from india.\\nThe authors are with the department of environmental studies, the national university of singapore, singap\\nAbstract\\nThis study investigates the energy dynamics in India between 1980 and 2006. A co 2 emissions equation is constructed based on the neoclassical growth model and energy balance theory.

We find a close correspondence between the model outputs and those of the cge model as regards energy demand, energy intensity and co and n\\nemissions, which are estimated from the co-emission equation.

The authors find that the effects are highly concentrated: while there exist several policies which have had a positive effect on growth during the past three decades, others have clearly worked in the opposite direction. A large number of policies have been tried and discarded. The main policy conclusions are that, although the government's fiscal deficit did play an important role in promoting economic activity, its impact was limited. On the other hand, a well-targeted, pro-poor expenditure program can have a very significant impact, particularly when it complements private capital flows. This finding is especially important, since there is currently a tendency in many developing countries, especially in South Asia, to advocate a \\\"privatization\\\" of social and economic policy, as a means of\",\"the political economy of indian power sector reforms 2014\\nthe power of the imagination and the nature of reality\\n2000 dodge intrepid fuse manual\\nmanual of surgical instruments for oral surgery and orthodontics by james e gurney md facsd 1 jan 2006 hardcover\\n1992 yamaha 25eshq outboard service repair maintenance manual factory\\ndodge charger 1968 factory service workshop repair manual download\\nhonda civic manual 1984 for sale\\nnokia 5800 manual guide\\nmolecular biology of cancer methods and protocols methods in molecular biology\\n2015 honda odyssey owners manual pdf\\npractical guide to managing your small animal practice by david dawson 1999 11 28\\ntoshiba e studio 3507c service manual user guide repair\\nfederal rules of evidence 5th revised\\nsamsung rf266aers service Manual & Repair Guide\\nc\",\"on prices and economic power: explaining recent changes in intersectoral relations in the indian economy by rajkumar singh. 3 \\u2022 a recent study of the effect of trade on the distribution of income has shown that the share of gdp generated by industry in india was 17 per cent in 1996 and 22.

The process of industrialisation in the Indian economy has its own special features, which are different from what is happening in most of the Western countries. In the first place, it has occurred much earlier in our history than it did in other countries and, secondly, its pace has not been as steady as in some other parts of Asia.

In India the GST is the biggest tax reform since independence. Impact of GST on economy. 1. This will be a major boost for the Indian economy and will lead to a rise in consumption, investment and exports, leading to economic growth and employment generation. It will reduce the burden on small and medium-sized businesses and make them more competitive, and it will create jobs by increasing the competitiveness of the economy in the long term. The introduction of this tax will also lead the government to spend more on infrastructure projects and create employment as well as generate more revenue in other sectors like healthcare, banking, etc. GST would make the tax system more transparent and equitable. For example, an exporter who exports to another country will pay tax only at the point of export.

Data was gathered through questionnaire from 100 personnel in three different grades from an Indian company. Results indicate that job dissatisfaction is related negatively with organizational commitment and satisfaction. Organizational commitment was found to be an important mediator between occupational stressors and job stress. Occupational stressors are significantly related with job anxiety. It is found that the level of job demand, control and social support are found as the major sources of stress at workplace. This paper concludes that it is very important for the organizations to create a positive organizational culture, to ensure a happy and satisfied work force.

The book provides a detailed picture of changing inter sectoral relationship between the agriculture, industry and services sectors for the years 1987-1995.\\nThe first two chapters are devoted to the theoretical aspects of inter - sectorial relationships. In chapter one, a brief description of theoretical approach is provided. It includes the concepts of production function, technical progress, capital stock and inter industry demand. A theoretical framework for inter industrial demand and a graphical representation of this framework are also presented. Chapter 2 discusses the methodology of empirical analysis.

The per capita income rose by 2.7% per annum. But, the employment growth rate has been very slow, especially in recent years. In 1998-89, there was a decline in growth of per capital income as the GDP growth slowed down to less than 4%. At the same time, growth in employment slowed considerably and the unemployment rate rose from 7.2% in 1983-84 to 11.5% by March,1999. This is despite the fact that the labour force participation rate increased from around 35% to more than half during this period. There are two important reasons for this slow growth and employment decline. First, during the second phase, a new set of problems arose. Second, in addition to these factors,\",\"the return of the colonial in indian economic history: the last phase of colonialism in india, 1947-1992 (routledge studies in the modern history of asia)\\nThe Return of The Colonial In Indian Economic History: The Last Phase Of Colonialism In India,1949-97 by S.P Singh\\nIn this book S Singh provides the first full length study of economic aspects of Indian decolonization.

This paper examines how firm behaviour and performance have changed during this period of rapid transition. Using data from the Business Group Survey Panel of the Reserve Bank of India, we find that firms belonging to the same group tend to be similar in terms of diversification, capital intensity and firm size. We find some evidence that the diversification behaviour of firms varies across the groups. The data also suggest that groups have responded to increased competition by increasing investment in capital goods and by diversifying into newer and more productive industries. However, despite these improvements in performance, many firms are not able to maintain their competitiveness.

This study explores the impact of two different types of ethics climate on the employee commitment and the effect of ethical practices on these climates. It also studies how these two dimensions of climates interact with job performance in the Indian bank sector.

A strong ethical orientation also has an impact on organizational performance.

Total factor technological efficiency has been estimated by means of Malmquist index and DEA-based Malinvaud index to assess the efficiency gains in manufacturing industry and also to measure the technical change of industries. The estimates suggest that the rate of change in technical intensity of the Indian industry is 3.7 percent per annum, which implies that technical progress is being made at a relatively fast rate in Indian industries with the exception of textiles and food processing industries where technological improvement is slower. We also find evidence of efficiency gain in the manufacturing sector as the Malvintus Malindu index of aggregate technical efficiencies is rising steadily.

Our model is estimated for two decades, 1951-80 and 1981 - 99 using annual data for a panel of 15 states in India. The results show that the share of growth in the capital-natural resource-labor input product (K) is 0.7% of GDP, while the labor-capital product is equal to 4.0% and total product to about 3.4%, implying that growth was mostly driven by capital and not labor.

The second is that there has been an erosion of civil society institutions. And, the third is a decline in the quality of our democratic institutions and processes.

There is an increasing feeling of despair, cynicism and disillusionment among large segments of society with regard to the future of democracy and the polity in general.

However, the rapid growth of this industry has not benefited the labour force in terms of higher wages, better working conditions and job security. In fact, labour in India, as elsewhere in South Asia, remains relatively undervalued and under-employed. The current industrial and economic policies have been shaped by the dominant global market-oriented ideology. As a result, workers are often seen only in economic and political terms. This paper focuses on one of India`s most vulnerable sectors, namely, textiles and clothing, to demonstrate how the state has been unable to protect the interests of workers and ensure decent employment.\",\"indian economy: its development experience\\nIndian Economy: Its Development Experience (by D.D.Basu)\\nThe economy of India is an open market economy.

Even in developed countries, the data may not be completely reliable due to the inherent problems associated with data collection and recording in developing countries and also due the fact that the labour force in these nations is not adequately represented by the official records. It would be very useful to have a reliable source for the collection of such data in countries like India. There is, however, an urgent need to develop such a source. Until then, we must make do with the available data and estimate the parameters as best we can, even when the estimates are not entirely satisfactory due partly to inadequate data quality\",\"culture and economy in the indian diaspora\\n- \\\"The Indian diaspora\\\" redirects here.\\nThe terms 'Indian diaspora', \\u201cIndian expatriates\\u201d, \\u2018Indians Abroad\\u2019 and \\u2019South Asians Abroad\\u2019, are frequently used to refer to the Indian Diaspora.

For example, using the forests and its products for food, shelter, clothing and firewood etc. The resources of our environment are called renewable because they can replace themselves.

(2005)\\nAbstract:\\nThis paper examines the relationship between Digitization of trade and employment creation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the role of Digitisation of Trade and E-Commerce in creating employment in an economy. A time series econometric model is developed to test the hypothesis that digitisation and electronic commerce have a significant impact on employment. Results show that ecommerce has a positive impact upon employment and also it helps to create employment for rural and semi-urban areas. Digitized trade has also shown a direct relationship with employment; it has been seen that in India, trade digitised with China, has increased the employment rate in the economy, thereby reducing the unemployment rate and increasing the economic prosperity of the country.Keywords: digitized Trade, employment, e commerce, China.\",\"Health Infrastructure, Health Outcome and Economic Wellbeing: A District Level Study in India\\nThis study was conducted in the year 2005.\\nThe study focused on the role played by the healthcare system in achieving the goals of social security, health, and economic wellbeing and development in different districts of India. To achieve the stated objectives of the survey, the study adopted a mixed method design. It used the primary data from a representative sample of 300 households in each district and secondary sources from published literature and statistical sources. The study identified a range of health indicators to measure the status of people's health and to understand the relationship with other development indicators. These include life expectancy at birth, infant mortality rates, maternal mortality ratios, immunization coverage, under-5 mortality rate, adult literacy rates and poverty levels.\",\"humoral defence factors in indian river prawn, macrobrachium malcolmsonii.\\n\\nThe humoral immune response of adult Indian river shrimp, Macrobrachiun malcomsoni to various bacterial and fungal pathogens was evaluated. A total of 14 serum samples from the 7th to 12th instars of this shrimp collected at different periods from 4 to12 weeks after hatching and from a number of different water sources were screened. The results show that a large number (70%) of serum contained antibodies that were specific for at least one of the bacterial pathogens studied. However, only a few serum \\\"reacted\\\" with two or more of them. In addition, a very low frequency of antibody production was seen against the pathogenic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium verrucosum. It may be concluded that these two shrimp serums are not useful as a diagnostic aid for the detection of bacterial or fungous pathogens. \\n\",\"productivity in the indian economy\\nAbout\\nLanding\\nIndia's manufacturing sector' growth has slowed to just 1.8% in January 2020 as per the latest data from the National Statistics Office (NSO).

In fact the idea of bringing black economy into the tax net was a vision of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

But the implementation of this vision had become a matter of great debate. There were strong voices opposing it as it would affect the daily transactions of people.

The model provides an explanation for the uneven distribution of income within the country and among different regions. While the share of agriculture in total employment has been declining, in terms of output contribution it has remained constant. In addition, while agricultural productivity has risen, output share in agriculture has declined. It is also observed from the model that the manufacturing sub-sector has contributed the maximum to both growth and employment in India.

Our findings indicate that the oil exporters have been experiencing the volatility in oil prices as compared to that of exporters of other major commodities. The oil export economy is more vulnerable to shocks of commodity prices. We have also found that shocks to the prices of non-oil exporting countries, especially the ones with high per capita income, are significantly higher than that to oil exporting ones.

This is the most significant and important change that has transformed the economy in a post-independence period. The process is gradual as the Indian state is still the dominant force in determining the direction of the economic policy, and the state remains the major employer in both the public and private sector. As the transition takes place the market and state continue to operate in parallel, but with increasing convergence.

The data set was constructed to capture farmers\\u2019 perceptions of temperature, rainfall patterns, crop performance, farm management, fertilizer use, pesticide use and knowledge about climate. In a first step, the data were used to construct a set of variables that captured farmers' knowledge and perceptions about changing temperature and precipitation. Then, these variables were combined to create measures of passive climate adaptation that we use as explanatory variables in a second step. Our results suggest that farmers are actively adjusting their agricultural practices to adapt to higher temperatures. However, they are passive when it comes to changing their knowledge. We argue that the reason for this may be that they do not have enough scientific and technical knowledge to be\",\"Performance of urban storm drainage network under changing climate scenarios: Flood mitigation in Indian coastal city of Thiruvananthapuram\\nAbstract\\nThis research aims to evaluate the hydrological response of a large urban drainage basin in the Indian city, Thiraunanthapurm, under various climate change scenarios. The drainage system of the Thriunathanthpuram consists of 12 sub-basins and a main channel. These subchannels are linked to a stormwater pumping system, which pumps out the water from the basin to the sea. A 4D-2Q2C model is used to perform hydrologic analysis of subbasin level. This model was calibrated by using the observed discharge data for 2006 to 2015, and validated against observed discharges and streamflow for the period 1993\\u20132005. To simulate the future discharge, 20th -century CMIP5 climate simulations were used. Three climate downscaling techniques were adopted.

The australian summer monsoon is the dominant rainfall region of the southern hemisphere and is one of most important sources of rainfall for the indian subcontinent. During the last three decades the strength and variability of this monsoonal rainfall system has been significantly reduced and has become more difficult to forecast. In the past, it was suggested, that the reduction in monosonal flow was related to the warming of tropical atlantic water in its southern portion, the \\\"warm pool\\\", and the associated increase in surface wind shear. To understand the changes in circulation and rainfall during these periods, a comprehensive set of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (A-OGCMs) and ocean general climate model analyses [from a 3-year hindcast -\",\"Impact of climate change on biodiversity of India with special reference to Himalayan region-An overview\\n- Authors\\nAbstract\\nBiodiversity of the Indian Himalayas is the richest and the most diverse of any region in the world. The region is endowed with 12 major biogeographic regions. This study deals with the impacts of climatic changes on Himalayan biodiversity with a special focus on the impact of global warming, and provides an overview on climate and climate related parameters affecting flora and fauna. In the present paper various factors are considered which affect the Himalayan flora-fauna in a bid to predict the effect of changing climatic conditions on this unique ecosystem of biodiversity. It has been found that Himalayan Flora and Fauna are likely to be adversely affected with increase in temperature as the alpine plants are expected to suffer most due to increased temperature, while the lowland plants would be able to survive. With the increase of temperature in alpine regions, the vegetation type may shift from a subalpine forest to a\",\"Green strategies: Response of Indian banks to climate change\\n-\\nThis study examines how Indian commercial banks are responding to the risk of climate-related financial losses due to their exposure to energy and other infrastructure sectors that have a direct impact on the climate. It is found that most banks have yet to take any action to manage climate related risks to any material extent. However, this is likely to change rapidly as banks recognise the material impact of the risks and the growing expectations of stakeholders and regulators. The results also suggest that the Indian government should consider taking steps to incentivise banks in managing climate risks.\\nContents\\nIntroduction\\nClimate change and India\\nWhat is bank exposure?\\nBanks in India: climate risk factors and climate finance\\nThe climate and energy risks that banks face\\nWhy do banks not manage risk?

A man was climbing a tree right outside the window, a small boat in tow and a long pole in his grip. My grandpa explained that it was a local fisherman who was out fishing. But, there was something strange about it. The fisherman was wearing a blue shirt with a white patch on his left shoulder, an Indian army uniform. I wondered why he would be up a big old tree in our compound, especially when the man in white was in full combat gear. He was not alone.

A recent study of the agricultural sector in India by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that the sector is very vulnerable, and that climate-related hazards such as extreme drought, heavy rain and extreme heat events have led to crop damage, livestock deaths, water shortages for irrigation and increased water logging.\\nThe study shows, for example, that more than 50 percent of India\\u2019s agricultural output depends on rainfed agriculture. The study notes that while climate projections are uncertain, it expects that crop yields and livestock productivity will decrease in the future in most parts of southern India, northern India and western India. And that in all these regions, the frequency and extent \\u2014 and, in some cases, intensity \\u2013 of extreme events will be expected to increase. This will lead to a decline in crop production. It will also cause water stress, which could reduce productivity and increase the risk of crop failure and crop loss.

The heat rejection of the air-conditioner is done by a fan that drives the indoor air flow rate. It is observed that the heat load of any air conditioner system increases when the ambient temperature of a zone increases. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the theoretical energy efficiency for air cooler using evaporating and condensing heat pipes. This system has the ability to reject heat to any external zone and to absorb heat from any internal zone. A theoretical analysis for the performance and energy savings of heat-pipe based system in a single zone has been presented. In the proposed system, heat transfer is achieved by passing the evaporant (hot plate) to a condensor - which is the cool side of condencer.

The BoB samples show that the magnetic field of magnetite is of a lower strength than is that observed in similar sedi-ment in South China Sea. This is due to the fact that sedimental magnetites have formed under the influence of different magnetic and environmental field conditions. However, the magnetitic mineralogy, as determined with x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, show similarities in both sedimen and magnetism. A significant feature in this study is the detection of magnetic mineral particles with diameters smaller than 2 \\u00b5m and their magnetic properties. These particles are probably produced by chemical weathering of pyroxenoids and olivines in sediment from a source area.

This paper presents the results of a survey of the impact of climatic variables on the rice yield in south India. It also provides an analysis of how climate variability may affect rice cultivation in future. The survey reveals the following. There is a clear increase in rice productivity during the period 1959-1979. During the same period, there was no significant change in rainfall or mean air temperature over the state of kerala. However, the number of rice cropping seasons increased from 2.5 in 1980s to 3.25 in early 1990 s. In contrast, it was noted that the rainfall pattern and temperature have changed in keralam. Thus, rice may be less sensitive to the current change of temperature but more sensitive towards rainfall patterns in coming decades.\",\"The role of the Indian Summer Monsoon variability on Arabian Peninsula summer climate variability is assessed by using re-analyzed ERA-Interim rerun data from 1980 to 2000.

It is observed that the village, which has already experienced severe flooding and other climatic extremes, is highly sensitive to climatic changes, and therefore, has low resilience capacity. The vulnerability of this community is further amplified by its social characteristics such as a high dependence on natural resources, low income level, large household size, female-headed households, poor education levels, high illiteracy rate and low access to information. These factors are considered as drivers for climate-induced displacement and vulnerability. This study also explores the coping capacities of the community, through various livelihood strategies such a shifting cultivation, fishing, livestock rearing, migration and cultivation with the use of chemical fertilizers.

The results from the participatory survey show that the small-scale farmers in this region have adopted agroforestry (AGF), conservation agriculture, mixed cropping, intercropping and inter-seasonal cropland management practices. These farming practices, when practised collectively, can contribute significantly towards adaptation to climate shocks. This is because these practices have the ability to improve crop yields in droughts and floods and protect against soil erosion in floods, and to maintain soil moisture and fertility in dry spells. Moreover, the farmers' participation in various agricultural development activities such as agro-foresty, conservation agricultural farming, integrated farming and farm mechanization have improved their adaptive capacity\",\"Field studies of thermal comfort across multiple climate zones for the subcontinent: India Model for Adaptive Comfort (IMAC)\\nThe study has been conducted to understand the impact of outdoor thermal environment on perceived thermal discomfort and its consequences on human health and productivity.

These hazards threaten the lives of millions of people, damage agricultural and forest resources, and cause billions of dollars in economic losses. Climate change, the increase in global temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions, will further aggravate the impact of these hazards. This is why the Indian Government has taken climate vulnerability assessments seriously, in order to inform policy development and to identify areas in need of adaptation action. In this paper, we examine what the results of such assessments might mean for managing water and other natural resources in a country like India. We find that the impacts of floods and drought are likely to increase as global warming continues, while the effects of heatwaves are projected to diminish.

It is also the second most populous country, and has a population that is growing by 1.3% per annum. Climate change is one of many threats to food security, as climate patterns become increasingly uncertain and unpredictable. This research aims to understand the current status of forest resources in India and their impact on the environment and people. The research also examines India\\u2019s efforts to address the impact of climate and deforestation change on agricultural and nutritional resources, through the Sustainable Development Goals and its 14th Five-Year Plan.\\nThe results of this\",\"Climate change, cryosphere and impacts in the Indian Himalayan Region\\nThe Indian Himalayas is a region that is extremely sensitive to climatic variations. The mountain glaciers, the cryospheric components, have been declining in number and area since the beginning of 20th century. This is because of the anthropogenic activities, like deforestation, forest fragmentation, mining, construction and other anthropocene stressors. There is no dearth of literature on the impacts of climate change in Himalayan regions. What is more worrisome is that the glaciers in high altitudes are declining at an alarming rate, causing floods and landslides in lower regions, affecting lives, livelihoods and property. In addition to this, it is also affecting the agriculture of these regions in a negative way due to climate variability and change. Thus there is need for urgent action to save the Himalaya and its cryogenic components.\",\"Evaluating urban heat island in the critical local climate zones of an Indian city: A case study of Delhi\\nAbstractAims: To study the urban climate of the city of New Delhi (India), the capital, in relation to the climatic characteristics of its local zones, namely, the \\\"cool city\\\" area, located in its southwestern part, and the rest of \\u2026\\nShare - Bookmark\\n- Download from\\n-%2010.%20pdf\\nPDF\\u002fA\",\"Role of atmospheric adjustments in the tropical Indian Ocean warming during the 20th century in climate models\\nTypeArticle\\nAuthorsMantovani, M.\\nBoucher, O.H.V.M.P.C.A.E.J.G.R.L.F.N.T.B.S.K.D.U.Y.I.O.W.v.d.Z. de\\nKAUST DepartmentEarth Surface Physics\\nPhysical Science and Engineering (PSE) Division\\nClimate Dynamics and Change Program\\nDate2011\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstractWe present an analysis of the climate sensitivity to the radiative forcing due to changes in atmospheric constituents in models that simulate tropical ocean and sea level rise over the past century.

The bleaches were not only the longest recorded, lasting almost four months on the atoll of Moorea, in a region that usually has two to three months bleeching, they were also among those longest in terms of area affected. These were the first recorded bleeches for French polynesia and the most extensive bleachings ever reported in any tropical coral region.

A few studies have assessed these impacts in the Indian context, but most of them are focused on the rural areas. This paper provides a review of air pollution and climate-sensitive health issues in urban areas of India. It is found that air pollutants in cities pose significant risks to the health of Indian population with the increasing number of vehicles and rapid urbanization. Air pollution has been shown to be a significant risk factor of a number health outcomes, including premature deaths (mainly from cardiovascular disease, stroke), hospitalizations, reduced lung function, decreased respiratory health & lung cancer. The health effects of climate changes in future may further exacerbate the situation. Therefore, a set of policy measures need to take up to reduce the air and climatic pollutants\",\"Cultural values and indigenous knowledge of climate change and disaster prediction in Rajasthan, India\\nAbstract\\nClimate variability and its effects on society have been a major issue in India. The country is prone to floods, cyclones, drought, landslides, earthquakes, and epidemics. In the recent past, the country has been hit by severe climate disasters like cyclone Aila (2009), cyclonic storm Fani 2019 and the earthquake in Jammu and Kashmir in 2005. This paper focuses on the perceptions, awareness, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, practices and perceptions of the community towards climate variability, climate hazards and climate predictions with respect to agriculture. It examines the role of indigenous cultural values in adaptation to climate and disasters in rural communities. For understanding the issues around climate prediction, 20 households from three villages were interviewed using semi structured questionnaires.

Indian rainfall is a highly complex hydrological phenomenon, influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. The Indian summer monsoons are highly variable, and the variability is influenced primarily by large scale atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections over the tropics. These are the primary drivers of the Indian Monsoon. A number of climate model simulations have been made to study the influence of external forcing such as greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol radiative forcing on the hydrology of India. In this paper, we compare observed data and simulated rainfall over 1951\\u20131996 for the 16 CM1 climate simulations from the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). We have also performed statistical tests for these simulations. We find that, except for some of these CM simulations, all CM IP5 simulations do not reproduce\",\"Monsoon-induced biases of climate models over the tropical Indian Ocean\\nAbstract.\\nThe Indian summer monsoon plays a critical role in the climate system of the northern Indian ocean.

Rainfall is an important climatic phenomenon, especially in a semi-arid region as India, where its variability has a significant impact on agricultural production, socio-economic activities, energy generation, water supply and availability of drinking water and so on. The review is aimed at providing a brief overview of the summer season rainfall variations at various sites across India over the past two centuries based on published and unpublished sources of data. A detailed analysis on the inter-annual variability of precipitation has been done for 16 stations across the country. It has also been found that summer rainfall is highly variable and exhibits a wide spread of variability in different parts of India during the period (1871-78).

However, in a context of climate and land-use change it is necessary to assess the impact of this practice on water availability and on land and groundwater quality. The present article examines the effects of increased use, by Indian farmers, of water from aquifers that are recharged mainly through rainfall, and which are subject to seasonal fluctuation, on groundwater levels and its quality (\\u201cpulse irrigation\\u201d). It uses an original data set of \\u201cwater pulse\\u201d surveys conducted over the last 40 years in 10 Indian agro-climatic zones (ACZs). The results show that pulse irrigation has become more widespread over this period and that, while the water-pump technology used in the practice is generally appropriate, its use has increased the risk of salinization in areas with a high potential for salinity\",\"Simulation of the Indian summer monsoon regional climate using advanced research WRF model\\nAbstract\\nThe Indian monsoons are one of most intense monolithic climate system in the world and the source of water for a huge amount of population. The monologue nature of this climate can be explained as the strong influence of solar insolation and atmospheric dynamics on the regional circulation of monoclonal climate. In order to investigate the role of climate change in future monoclone climate, one needs to have a better understanding of its variability and predictability. To understand the climate variability, the model should be able to produce realistic monocal climate and its associated extreme. However, it is difficult to model the monoclimte accurately due to the complex atmospheric flow, land-atmosphere interactions, and strong coupling of atmospheric and land surface parameters. Therefore, to predict the future climate under climate changes, an understanding and simulation of natural and anthropogenic variability of Indian Summer Monsoon is a must.

The heat is generally attributed to the strong monsoonal winds, which push hot air from India into Pakistan. This wind then blows over parts the Himalayas, creating a temperature drop on the western slopes and warming of the air on its way down over Pakistan, leading to high temperatures in Pakistan in late May to mid July, and also over Northern India (see figure). In the last decade, the severity of these heat waves in the Indus Basin has dramatically increased \\u2014 in terms of both intensity and duration: the heatwaves of 2015 and 2001 have been more intense than those of past decades, with temperatures reaching record highs and the length of their duration increasing by 10\\u201312 days.

The survey was conducted from January to September 2016. A total of 120 farmers (60 from the hill and 60 low land areas) were interviewed. In this study, it was found that farmers were aware that climate is changing but they didn\\u2019t have the perception of change of their own environment. This perception was significantly different among different categories of farmers. Hill farmers perceived climate to be changing, whereas lowland farmers did not show any change in their environment and thought of themselves as \\u2018climate resilient\\u2019. The results showed that low-land farmer perceived risk of water, soil erosion and pests as greater than the high-landers.

As the death toll increased with the passage of time, media coverage of the disaster increased and it became clear that the deaths were largely attributable to the effects of extreme heat and not of any other cause. A heatwave, which is a period of unusually high temperatures, has been associated in some studies with mortality, but the causal relationship is not fully understood. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the national weather forecasting agency has now published an analysis of a heat-death cluster that occurred during a 10-day period in mid-April 2106.

In 2009, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated the sea levels would rise between 18 cm and 59 cm for a global average temperature increase of 4 \\u00b0C, and between one-third and one half of this amount at a temperature of two \\u00b0\\u00b0C.

By adding more heat energy into the atmosphere, a warming planet would tend to intensify the circulation around the pole and weaken it at the equator, where the monosons blow into land masses (in the southern hemisphere, of course). This would cause a stronger poleward flow that would lead to a more intense Indian Monsoon during warm periods and a weaker polewards flow in cold periods, with less rainfall and fewer monson events. The authors tested this hypothesis with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model with and without this effect: the model without the extra heat showed the \\u201cnormal\\u201d monsson patterns. But with the addition of extra energy the climate became more variable, and the\",\"Climate change and Indian forests\\nThe forests of India play a key role in combating climate change by capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, storing carbon and releasing oxygen.\\nIndia\\u2019s forests absorb approximately one-fourth of the country\\u2019 s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) per year.

In the past decade alone, Indian rainforests have sequestered over 200 Mt of greenhouse gases. This is an area of about the size of Belgium. The carbon stored in the forest is equivalent in weight and mass to that present in 5.6 lakh cars, and 8 per cent of total global greenhouse emissions from all man-made sources. Indian forestry and agriculture can therefore be considered the largest carbon sinks on Earth. A large majority of these sinks are found in tropical forests, but India\\u2019\",\"Projected increase in hydropower production in India under climate change\\nAbstract\\nThe present climate conditions and the future climate projections indicate that, in general, the Indian summer monsoon is likely to be more intense with higher rainfall and more frequent and stronger rainfall events. This is expected to affect the river flows which in turn could affect hydropowering. To estimate the projected change in the power output, this study has used a global hydrological model and a hydrotechnical model. Projection of rainfall under various climate scenarios has been done using two climate models, HadRM3.1 and HadCM3, with the period of 1950\\u20132035. The hydrologic model is used to simulate streamflow using the calibrated parameters for the selected sub-catchment, which is considered as a reference catchment for comparison. A hydrotectical hydraulic model has also been used for simulation and estimation of the energy available from the sub catchments.

I. Evaluation of impact assessment models using remote sensing data.\\nAbstract\\nRice cultivation in India covers 10 million hectares and provides food for 150 million people. The rice yield is strongly related to climate change. This study estimates the impact of climate variability and change on rice production in six agroecological zones of the Indian states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Assam. We use the 1980s-based National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting climate data and the MODIS 3-monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from June 2000 to May 2010. For this time period, we use a set of remote-sensing- and weather-model-driven methods to estimate and compare the effect of temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. Our estimates show that rice is highly affected by the temperature increase.

This has become even more severe with the increased occurrence of extreme climate events. In this study, we have investigated the sensitivity of the crop-based crop productivity of two agroecological zones in India\\u2014the North Western India (NW) and North-Eastern India. For this purpose, a multi-criteria approach was used in which the impact of various climatic variables on the yield of rice and wheat crops for different agroclimatic zones were evaluated. The results indicate that crop yields in both zones will decline by 30 and 20%, respectively, by the end of this century. Further, the results reveal that the NW agrozone is comparatively more sensitive to temperature variability than the NE agrozones. However, in terms of relative impact on yield, both regions exhibit higher sensitivity in the\",\"Climate change adaptation implications for drought risk mitigation: a perspective for India\\nIn India, extreme climatic changes, including increasing temperatures and precipitation variability and frequency, have been affecting agriculture, natural ecosystems, the economy, and the well-being of human populations since the 1900s.\\nExtreme climate has also been identified as contributing to the spread of disease, such as malaria, cholera and dengue fever; increased vector-borne disease; reduced water quality; crop damage due to pests and plant disease and water logging; forest dieback, forest fires and forest fragmentation. Extreme climate events such floods and severe droughts cause widespread economic and human losses. The frequency and severity of drought in the country has increased in recent years.

The crop has the potential to contribute to the livelihoods and food security of the region. However, the crop productivity, which is dependent on the weather condition, is highly susceptible to adverse weather events such as heat stress. Heat waves are projected to increase significantly in number, frequency, and intensity in the coming decades. To assess the vulnerability, we developed a crop model \\u201cSVM\\u201d to forecast crop yield for sorhums. In SVM, crop water productivity (%CPW) was the most sensitive parameter to temperature. Increasing heat wave temperature had significant effect on sorgum grain yield in all the 16 locations.

It is happening as we speak. In the next thirty years, the climate is expected to warm by 2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit in many parts of North America, with the most dramatic temperature increases projected for the far northern reaches of Alaska, Canada, and the Arctic. As this climate shifts, communities in these areas will be impacted by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. These changes will have impacts on the economy and environment. Climate adaptation is necessary for communities to survive and thrive into the future. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reports that adaptation will likely be more cost effective than mitigation, particularly for rural communities. However, there are barriers that prevent some tribes and indigenous communities from adapting to climate changes. This study will address two main questions.

The main objective of this study is to analyze the impact of future climate scenarios on food production in different agroecological regions of India, and to explore the vulnerability of different crops to climate variation and change. In addition, the thesis also explores the implications of various climate mitigation strategies in order to assess their potential to mitigate the negative impacts on crop productivity caused by climate variability and the climate changes. A literature review of existing scientific research on the issue is conducted, to identify the major issues associated with climate impact and its mitigation, based on which the research questions are formulated. Based on a detailed literature survey, various models of agricultural impact assessments are developed, which are used to conduct an exploratory study of how climate is expected to impact various crops, with respect to the climatic conditions of Indian agroclimatic zones.

These deserts form a vital part of our ecosystem and are the main habitat for a number of species, such as the endangered Great Indian Bustard, the Desert Fox, and the Blackbuck antelope. Many migratory birds also visit this area every year on their way north and south. Desert ecosystems are also important in the water cycle, storing rainwater in their sand and rock layers, thus maintaining the fragile equilibrium of desert ecosystems. They are a key source for water supply for millions of people in Rajasthan.

The study used the time-frequency technique and wavelets transform to analyse tuna landings time -series of the western Indian ocean, from 1972 to 2001. Using the wave-let analysis, two dominant modes were extracted from the data. From the first mode, the annual cycle is identified; and from second mode the monthly cycle and subannual cycle are identified, and are found to be the dominant oscillators. Then, an autocorrelation analysis was applied to the second harmonic of this oscillator. Finally, a Granger causality test is applied in order to check the causation between two series. It was shown that the fishing activity is affected by climatic conditions.\\nKeywords: Wavelets, Fishery data, Granger Causality,\\nLanguage: English\",\"Integrating blue-green infrastructure in urban planning for climate adaptation: Lessons from Chennai and Kochi, India\\n- Source:\\n 3(4): 1063-1076\\n-.\",\"Assessing the impacts of changing land cover and climate on Hokersar wetland in Indian Himalayas\\nLand use, land-cover and climatic change are known to affect aquatic ecosystems. The effects of land use change have attracted much of the recent scientific attention, but the effects on the functioning of wet ecosystems have remained relatively poorly studied.\\nIn the present study, the influence of a changing vegetation structure and its effects are examined on wet meadow ecosystem in the Himalayan foothills, India. Wet meadows in this area are dominated by species of Carex and Juncus, which are typical aquatic wet species. In the wet meadowe studied, a gradual shift from a wet to a dry meadow can be observed. This shift can have implications for the ecosystem.

The study is carried out by using a coupled general circulation model (GCM) with the atmospheric component driven by a 20 year control 1961-80 simulation. Two scenarios of future climate have been considered in this study, the first scenario represents an idealistic scenario and the second represents a realistic scenario. It is observed that in both scenarios the Indian Summer Monsoon will be affected. However, there is considerable difference in their intensity, and their impacts. Under the ideal scenario, both the intensity and frequency of the mon Soons decrease. Whereas, under the realistic scenarios, intensity of summer rainfall is predicted to increase and monSoons will become more frequent and intense. These findings indicate that the changes in summer climate will result in changes to the seasonal mon soons, leading to a significant impact on agriculture, water resources management, energy demand and supply and other human activities in Asia.\\nKey Words\",\"Role of the Indian Ocean in regional climate variability and change\\nThis article reviews recent work on the role of tropical Indian ocean variability in driving climate on interannual to multidecadal timescales.

The passive adaptive capacity among the Indian rural populations has been found to be relatively higher than the global average. However the passive capacity is found relatively low among those in the rural poor and vulnerable group. This implies that the vulnerable populations may face more severe impacts of climate shocks due to their relatively less ability to deal with climate variability. It is observed that rural households which are vulnerable, are more passive in their coping and adaptation strategies and the coping ability declines with increasing vulnerability. A higher passive coping capacity of Indian poor is attributed to greater household savings and access to social safety net.\",\"Experimental investigation of a solar cooker based on parabolic dish collector with phase change thermal storage unit in Indian climatic conditions\\n- 4 Downloads\\nAbstract\\nThe experimental investigation and analysis of solar energy thermal cooker (SET) was made by using a paraboloid dish solar collector and phase-change thermal energy storage [TCS] unit.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact and future impact on health due to climate variability and extreme weather in the state of Assam, India. In order to assess the vulnerability of population to the climate changes, it has been studied the impacts of heatwaves and rainfall variability on morbidity and mortality during the last five years 2011-2015. We have analyzed the association of temperature, precipitation, and heatwave with the death due cardiovascular disease, diarrheal and respiratory tract infections. Our results indicated that extreme climatic events like heatstroke and floods in this area is a threat to health, with an increased risk of morbidity in vulnerable groups and increased mortality in elderly people. Further, we found that climate related diseases like diarrhoeal infections are the major causes of death in Assam during summer months and the main factors for the rise of diarrhetic diseases are temperature and humidity.\",\"Monthly performance of passive and active solar stills for different Indian climatic conditions (with and with out heat storage)\\nThe passive solar water distillation system, which has been designed by Dr. P.R.K.

This is done by applying a stochastic simulation technique to estimate the yields and yields variability of major crops in India under current climate and projected climate scenarios. We find that a significant reduction in mean and range of crop yield is possible by the end of this century, due to climate warming in the future. However, the magnitude of impact depends strongly on the climate model used for projection. The impacts vary from crop, region, climate scenario, and model. For example, for wheat, yield decrease due temperature increase is highest in models with high temperature sensitivity, while it is very low in other models. Further, temperature and yield\",\"Impact of climate change on Indian forests: a dynamic vegetation modeling approach in a changing world\\nThe impact of global climate changes on natural environments is already noticeable and likely to increase in the future. This will alter ecosystem functions and potentially cause changes in biodiversity, productivity, and ecosystem processes.

This article addresses the emergence in recent decades of a \\u2018climate institution\\u2019 in New Delhi, India\\u2019s political capital. It is shown that this process of institutional emergence is not the product of an unproblematic and linear process, as is usually assumed in institutionalism; rather, it is fraught with difficulties and ambiguities, and it was achieved through the negotiation and contestation of multiple, often conflicting, visions and interests. We argue that the climate institution is, in a way, the (unintended) outcome of the particular way in which climate change has been understood in the Indian political context. Its uneven and ambiguous emergence, we argue, is due in large\",\"Asynchronous responses of East Asian and Indian summer monsoons to mountain uplift shown by regional climate modelling experiments\\n- 1Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany\\nAbstract.

The climate of India is generally characterized by a wide variability in temperature and precipitation, resulting in wide range of agro-climatic conditions. In addition, the country is also experiencing a rise in temperatures and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. Climate changes, particularly the increase of temperature, have a strong effect on crop development, which in turn affects the crop growth parameters. Climatic changes can influence the productivity of crops by either increasing or decreasing their growth potential. This review also discusses various adaptation strategies such as changing cultivars, changing growing practices, shifting the cropping seasons and developing new crop varieties that can withstand the adverse impacts of changing climate.\\nKeywords: Climate Change; Adaptation; Climatically Induced Stress; India\\nIssue\\nSection\\nOriginal Research\\nAuthors retain the copyright of\",\"Climate change and water availability in Indian agriculture: impacts and adaptation options\\nDate2004\\nMetadata[+] Show full item record\\nAbstract\\nThe paper presents a synthesis of the current literature on the impacts of climate change on water and agricultural production in India, and explores the possible adaptation strategies available. It is based on secondary analysis and draws from a comprehensive set of studies on agricultural impacts. We present evidence suggesting that, due to the increasing severity of water deficits, the production of major food crops (cereals, rice, wheat and pulses) will decrease significantly in the near future. The most vulnerable crops to climate variations seem to be rice and wheat. A decline in rice yields may reach up to 40% by 2075 due primarily to water scarcity, although climate variability is expected to increase. Wheat production may decline by up 30% over the same period. Our analysis reveals a strong association between temperature and crop yield variability, as well as between water deficit and yield variation.\",\"Mitigating climate change impact on soybean productivity in India: a simulation study using crop models\\n- Source:\\nAbstract\\nThe objective of this study is to assess the impact of climate changes on crop yield of soybean using the simulations of crop growth models.

India is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to its highly populated regions and extensive agricultural land which is very much susceptible to the climate changes like extreme weather. In the last one century India has experienced more than 50% of climate variability and change in the country. This variability can be attributed to natural and anthropogenic sources. The present study will focus on the impact of anthropogenically driven changes in emission of carbon dioxide, methane, black carbon, and tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols on surface radiative forcings and their impact to global and regional climate, specifically the monsoon and its variability. We will investigate the emission estimates of CO2, CH4, BC and SO2 and compare with the observational data.

The research objective of this paper is to study the farmer perceptions on climate changes in Uttar Pradesh (North Indian state) of India. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was administered to 100 farmers. Results of study show that farmers perceive a change in their farming conditions due to climate variability, which may be caused by climate-change. This perception is more for those farmers who have more education and experience. Farmers have perceived that climate has changed their agriculture conditions. However, they have not perceived the change due climate warming.

We interpret the data in the context of changes in precipitation and temperature, based on the 18O and 17O records. During the last glacial cycle (~ 20 kyears), the southward expansion of cold air from northern mid-latitudes led to the formation of an ice sheet over northern India. The resulting climate amelioration was followed by a shift in monsoon rainfall to more southern latitudes. This resulted in higher rainfall over the southern ghat region, but with a pronounced shift to earlier and drier monsoons, which were probably related to a change in sea surface temperature - in particular, the warming of tropical waters.\",\"Performance evaluation of photovoltaic thermal solar air collector for composite climate of India.\\nAbstract\\nIn the present study an experimental investigation of the performance of a solar thermal air air conditioning collector is performed at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela.

Also it is observed that thermal efficiency of air storage system reaches up to 70% in case of solar irradiation of 800 W per square meter.\",\"Dividing climate change: global warming in the Indian mass media\\nAbstract\\nThis paper examines the coverage of climate issues in three Indian languages (English, Hindi, and Malayalam), focusing on climate science and political issues of the Kyoto Protocol. This study explores how the media in each of these languages presents the issue of global climate in a manner that reflects the cultural and ideological background of each nation. The analysis reveals significant differences between the way these issues are addressed and framed in these three languages. While English has the least amount of coverage, this is due in large part to the fact that this coverage is often in specialized magazines. In addition, there are significant discrepancies in how climate is framed and discussed in Hindi and English. Finally, a comparison of how issues such as climate are discussed across all three newspapers reveals that Malayali newspapers are more likely to discuss the political dimensions of this issue than the Hindi or English newspapers.\\nKeywords\\nGlobal warming; Media; English; Malay; Hindi;\",\"The Southern Oscillation in surface circulation and climate over the tropical Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, and Indian Oceans as captured by cluster analysis\\nThe southern oscillation (El Ni\\u00f1o\\u2013Southern Oscilation) is a phenomenon of global significance, with impacts on climate as well as fisheries, agriculture, tourism, shipping, air quality, etc. The oceanic circulation is one of the principal drivers for climate variability in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, the most important being the trade winds and associated currents. In this study, a method of analysis by means of multivariate clustering was used to assess the impact of this phenomenon on surface-water circulation in all the three ocean basins in question. This method is based on the assumption that the circulation of water parcels in space is characterized by an intrinsic pattern or \\u201csignature\\u201d that can be quantified and used as a basis for clustering. For this purpose the authors used the ocean surface current vector from the NOAA Global Circulation Model. Clustering of time series was carried out using the Ward algorithm and then the clusters were analyzed with respect to their geographical\",\"harnessing leaf photosynthetic traits and antioxidant defence for multiple stress tolerance in three premium indigenous rice landraces of jeypore tract of odisha, india\\nThe study was aimed to identify the potential sources of stress in the field conditions and to understand the role of antioxidant defense in alleviating the stress conditions on three traditional rice cultivars of Jeypure region of Odisha. For the study, three land races of rice namely, Kshamal, Pundari, and Khandia were subjected to different types of abiotic environmental stresses such as salinity, drought, high temperature, submergence etc. The results of the present study revealed that the landrace Khamal showed the highest yield under drought stress condition, followed by Punda and khandi. Salinity induced severe reduction in grain yield and other agronomic traits in all the three indigenous land rases of khamil, kunda, an Pundi. Khusumal and Pundra also showed better recovery under salicylic acid (SA) and salicylamide\",\"Climate model simulation of the South Indian Ocean Convergence Zone: Mean state and variability\\n- ISSN: 1680-7324\\nAbstract\\nThe mean and extreme states of climate variables, and the variability of these variables in the context of a 100 year hindcast are presented for the period 1900\\u20132007 using an ocean-atmosphere coupled climate model. The mean climatological state of SINDICZ and SITIC is presented and their interdecadal variability is investigated. It is found that there is a large interannual variability in SIN, particularly for summer SST, that is not well described by the model, which is in line with previous studies. SIC exhibits high variability on the decadal time scale. There is evidence to show that SINTIC shows a strong link to the inter-decennial variability and inter annual variability exhibited by SINA, SICA and SI. These findings provide further support for earlier findings that the SIA and ENA are\",\"Calibrated simulation for estimating energy savings by the use of cool roof in five Indian climatic zones\\n- Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering and Technology, Aligarh Muslim University, Lucknow-226 021, Uttar Pradesh, India\\nAbstract. Roof area constitutes a major proportion in the built environment and the roof plays a vital role in protecting the building and also in regulating the internal thermal comfort of the buildings, thus affecting the indoor climate. In the present study, the effect of using cool roofs to reduce the heat transfer into and from the structure, was investigated using a calibrated simulation tool developed based on a simplified energy model. The study was carried out using the calibrated cooling simulation model and validated it with the actual data of a typical building of India. Results obtained from this validated model were found to be in excellent agreement with field data. This model can be used for assessing the energy efficiency of buildings with different climatic conditions and can serve as an important tool for decision making of selecting the suitable materials for the roofs in different parts\",\"Orbital insolation forcing of the Indian Monsoona motor for global climate changes?\\nAccessinfo:eu-repo\\u002fsemantics\\u002fopen access\\nDate2021\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThe global atmospheric circulation is driven predominantly by two different kinds of insolarforcing: the meridional temperature gradient and the zonal temperature gradients. These two types offorcing can be either directly derived from the insolaion or can indirectly arise by changes in the atmospheric heat content and moisture budget caused by the solar irradiation. A recent paper has shown by using a simple coupled model that the orbital insolareforcing, in combination with the tropical sea surface temperature forcing, can lead to a global change ofthe precipitation over the tropics, which is a result of changes induced by both meridianallocation and changes of atmospheric water content. In this paper, the authors aim to examine the role ofmeridionalliation and atmospheric humidity changes as an insoleroading mechanism\",\"Indo-Pacific climate during the decaying phase of the 2015\\u002f16 El Nio: Role of southeast tropical Indian Ocean warming and sea surface heights\\nThe tropical Pacific Ocean, the so-called El Ni\\u02dco Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is characterized by the alternation of El\\nNi\\u02dao (-ENO) and El Nina (+EN) phases.

The extent to which these impacts occur, however, will depend on the exposure of vulnerable coastal communities. A major challenge is the lack of information regarding the relative impacts, and thus relative vulnerability, on a spatial scale for many coastal nations. We develop a method to map the extent and relative magnitude of the potential impacts for coastal settlements in India, based on their exposure and sensitivity to the combined effects of sea level rise, storms, drought, extreme temperatures and flooding. These are the same variables used in our earlier work to estimate global-scale relative risks to coastal infrastructure and settlements. To map these variables, we use gridded global climate data from the NASA Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase III. For a sample of coastal Indian settlements we then estimate seaward and landward displacement probabilities under climate\",\"Climatic clusters of the Indian region: Their spatial and temporal variability\\n- 1Institute of Atmospheric Physics, University of Cologne, Joseph-Schumpel-Str. 4, 50931 Cologne\\nCorrespondence: Martin Sch\\u00e4fer (Martin.Schaefer@uni-koeln.de)\\nThe Indian monsoon is the most intense monsoonal circulation system in the world.

Climate change is a phenomenon that affects all societies, especially in developing and developing countries. In India, this has had significant consequences on human health and livelihood, and thus has become a matter of social justice. As a developing country, the Indian government and the international community are increasingly taking interest in addressing climate change through a justice lens.

This variability appears to be connected to the variability of Indian winter mon Soons, which are associated with the El Nio Southern Oscillation, or E NSO. A strong E nSo relationship was reported to exist from 1939 to 2001, but the strength of the E So relationship varied significantly from year to year, especially from the 1960s onwards. In the recent past, the relationship has weakened, and in fact the onset of monSons during the past 50 years has become increasingly earlier. There are several factors associated to this weakening. The first is global warming, caused mainly by increasing greenhouse gases and the second is associated directly with changes in Indian monSon rainfall.

The ITF has strong interannual variability - both in terms of the magnitude of heat flux through it and in its strength and spatial pattern. The strength of ITFs varies on decadal timescales, and the interdecadal oscillation of strength, which has been termed the Indo-Pacific inter-decal variability, is thought to be due to variations in Indian and Pacific basin sea surface temperature forcing ().

The Caribbean vertebra fauna is dominated by the large herbivores such as the tapirs, the glyptodonts, proboscideans and mastodonders, but it contains a significant proportion of small carnivorous mammals which are absent in modern West Indies. These mammals probably originated in South America. They were not present in the West African zoogeo-graphy during the Oligocene, so that they must have been present during a climatic period that was warmer than now. This warming is suggested to be a response to a northward advance in polar ice.

The empirical results indicate that rainfall is a leading indicator of agricultural activity in India. This implies that agricultural development in the country is highly dependent on rainfall variability. Our analysis also indicates that India\\u2019s agricultural economy is not very climate sensitive. In this case, climate is an input for production of food in agriculture rather than being a major factor for determining its productivity.

The paper has studied various aspects of a Hybrid Photovoltaic-Dieseland Standalone system like, solar PV generation, diesel generation and the integration of two systems. In this paper, a detailed analysis of different climatic condition has been done to estimate the solar and diesel energy availability. For the study a 100 kWp grid connected solar photovoltaically- diesel generator based hybrid system hasbeen proposed for a remote village. Simulation has also been carried out to assess the system reliability, availability and dispatch capability using Power World. It is also found that the proposed solar- hybrid-grid connected system is feasible and reliable at all the locations. Finally, it is seen that, the cost of the hybrid systems are less than the grid based photovoltaichydrogen systems for the\",\"Linking IPCC AR4 & AR5 frameworks for assessing vulnerability and risk to climate change in the Indian Bengal Delta\\n- 1Department of Environmental (Water) Management, Faculty of Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, 1081 HV Amsterdam.\\nCorrespondence and requests for materials: M. van der Linden, tel. +31 20 598 7337, e-mail: m.vanderlinden@vu.nl\\nAbstract. The Indian Bengal Delta is a densely populated delta region which is highly vulnerable to flooding due to its low geographical position, high precipitation and tidal range. To assess flood vulnerability the IPC framework was extended to cover climate-related floods and sea level rise in combination with socio-economic information. Based on this, the delta is classified as vulnerable. Flood protection measures in this delta are considered inadequate for the present level of flooding. This delta has a high risk of climate related floods, which has increased in recent years.\",\"Observing climate impacts on tea yield in Assam, India\\nThe research project 'Impact of climate change on yield of tea in the Assam district of India (2012-2016)\\u2019, is part of the project Climate-Smart Agriculture in India, and is carried out in partnership with the Indian partner organization Indian Institute of Technology Delhi.

Our study uses a combination of survey data gathered from 2005 to 2010, and weather data (rainfall, temperatures, wind speed, etc). Using these data, climate change impacts have been estimated, which in turn are expected to be compounded by other stressors such as market volatility and increasing cost of inputs like fertilizer. The impacts of these compounded stressors, on smallholders are also estimated. We find that the compunction of stressors is greater for the farmers, particularly, women farmers.

In this contribution, I show that this high variability can be explained by two different mechanisms: First, the annual monsoon circulation has been affected by the western branch of South Asian monsoons which have a more pronounced influence in this region because of their origin in Western Tropical Pacific, where the sea surface temperature and the monoswell amplitude are the highest in that region. The second mechanism is due to the interaction of this westerlies with the South India low, which is located in a narrow band in northern India. It is found that during the winter monomonsol, this interaction creates a region of high pressure in peninuslar India, called the Peninsulat India high,\",\"Simulating impacts, potential adaptation and vulnerability of maize to climate change in India\\nDate2009\\nAuthor\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nClimate change is expected to have a significant effect on agriculture in coming decades.

Climate models of global scale are able to simulate the large scale patterns and dynamics of oceanic circulation but have been found to overestimate the strength of Indian and Atlantic Oceans (AO) Walker circulations. It is proposed here that these errors are due to the inability of model to properly represent the strong winds that form the surface boundary layer in the subtropical gyres and are crucial for the ocean to be a strong heat engine. This is supported by a direct comparison between the wind speed and sea surface temperature at the 200 hPa level for a range of locations in both hemispheres. The results show that the models simulate strong eastward winds at ~ 1000 hpa and these winds are responsible for transporting water from equatorial and tropical latitudes to lat. 45\\u2218N and higher.

The present paper aims to understand and explore the perceptions, adaptation strategies and the coping mechanisms adopted by the forest-fringing communities of the Eastern Himalayan Region, India. For this study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the villages of North and South Sikkim, which are located in close proximity to the Tsomgo Lake and Nathula Pass, respectively. Using a mixed method approach, 500 households were surveyed by administering a self-administered structured questionnaire. A total of 300 household were also subjected to a focus group discussion.

It comprises a large number of tribal and indigenous communities which live in the forests and have very limited interaction with the rest of the world. This region is also known in history for its resistance against external invasion which was one of its characteristics. The NorthEast India comprises the states of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. Climate change is a global issue of great concern to the scientific fraternity, policy makers and the general public. There is consensus among the experts that climate change will have a significant impact on the NorthEastern region. India, as a whole is vulnerable to climate variability and extremes. North Eastern states are more vulnerable because of their unique geographic and ecological character and their limited capacity to cope with climate hazards and disasters.\\nArticle Details\",\"The Indian nitrogen assessment: Sources of reactive nitrogen, environmental and climate effects, management options, and policies\\nA report from the World Bank and UNEP\\nThe.\\nContents\\n- 1 The Report\\u2019s Context and Structure\\n2.1 Context\\n3.0 Report Structure and Contents\\n4.2 Assessment Methodology\\n5.4 Climate Change\\n6.10 Management Options\\n7.12 Policies\\n8.14 Appendix A: The World's Largest Nitrogen Fertiliser Manufacturers\\n9.15 Appendix B: Nitrous Oxide Emis sions from Agricultural Nitric Oxode\\n10.18 Bibliography\\n13.24 Glossary\\n14.26 Acronyms\\n15.29 References\\n1.

In 2010, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established an official process for the consideration of the impacts of climate on developing nations, including the U.S. The National Tribal Conservation Grants Program ($2.2 million) was established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. As part of this program, this research will examine the relationship between tribal climate adaptation and tribal regulations that protect natural and cultural resources on their reservations. This research project has been designed to address three objectives. First, it will identify tribal natural resource and land use regulatory programs that may protect or enhance climate resilience, as defined by tribal members. Second, tribal regulatory practices will be examined to\",\"Soil organic carbon storage changes with climate change, landform and land use conditions in Garhwal hills of the Indian Himalayan mountains, a high elevation tropical montane ecosystem: Insights from 14C and \\u03b413C dating and 210Pb dating\\n- 1Institute of Himalayan Biobiology, University of Life Sciences, Bikaner, India\\nAbstract.

The study revealed that the area under sheep is more in the northwestern, western and the northeastern part of India. In the present study, the climate of different regions was classified by using the Koppen-Geiger climatic classification system. Climate is one of most important factors influencing the livestock industry and its productivity is very much affected by it. It was found that during the last 30 years the annual temperature of many areas has risen by 3-4\\u00b0C, which is 0.1-1\\u00b0 C above normal. Rainfall is likely to decrease in north and east but increase in south and west India in 2031 and beyond in all agroclimate zones.

Using data from the India Meteorological Department, the study finds that the frequency of extreme heat events has increased substantially in both urban and rural areas of the country in recent decades. In 2020 alone, 14 Indian states experienced a heat wave, which resulted in more than 2000 deaths.\\nThe study estimates that heat-related health impacts have a significant negative effect on Indian economic welfare. The average daily GDP loss due to extreme weather-triggered heatwaves in 2019 is estimated to be more or less equivalent to the total annual health expenditure of an average Indian household. This estimate is even more significant for vulnerable populations such as women, elderly, low-income and low education groups, as they tend to bear a higher health burden.

A better understanding of the potential impacts of these changes on socio environmental systems in this region would enable the development of appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The present study assesses the vulnerabilities of different socioenvironmentally important systems along a height gradient to the climate changes in Himachal Pradesh. For this purpose, the spatial distributions of temperature, precipitation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were extracted from 20km resolution MODIS satellite images for the period 2001\\u20132010.

These effects can be either direct or indirect. The direct effects, mainly through variations in solar flux, are responsible for changing the atmospheric circulation and hence affecting the climate of various regions. On the other hand, indirect effects of solar variations can also modify the circulation in the atmosphere, through changes in stratospheric circulation, or the tropospheric heating, both of which can influence the weather and climate at the surface.\\nIn this study, we attempt to examine the possible impacts of sunspot activity, sun activity (UV flux) and interplanetary magnetic field \\u2014 which are three main factors responsible [directly or indirectly] for solar activities \\u2013 on Indian monsoon, winter and summer weather.

The Himalayan region is projected to be one of the most vulnerable regions, and cities are likely to bear the brunt of extreme climate events. This paper seeks to contribute to understanding of adaptation processes in Himalayan urban environments. Households living in two informal settlements in Shimla were studied to understand their adaptation strategies, decisionmaking processes, vulnerability and coping capacities. A mixed-methods approach was used to elicit information through a semi-structured questionnaire, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a household survey. Results indicate that adaptation to climate hazards is not yet well understood, though some households have been able to identify and implement adaptation responses. Vulnerability and capacity analyses were conducted to assess the vulnerability to and the coping capacity of households and community groups. These analyses indicated that the capacity for households to cope with climate-change impacts is affected by gender, education level, income level and household size.\\nDownloads\\nReferences\\n\",\"Climatic variables and malaria incidence in Dehradun, Uttaranchal, India\\nAbstract\\nA study of climatic factors affecting the incidence of malaria in a region has been attempted using the monthly mean maximum, minimum and mean temperatures and monthly accumulated precipitation during the monsoon, dry, winter and spring periods at DehraDun (Dehradoon), India. The study has attempted to establish a correlation between malaria and the climate and to study the influence of temperature and rainfall on malaria transmission at different seasons. Correlation between the climatic variables has also been established. A significant correlation has emerged between temperature, rainfall and incidence rate of the disease and a strong inverse relationship has developed between rainfall, and minimum temperature during summer months and disease incidence and between precipitation and temperature in winter, spring and fall months. It has further been observed that the mean temperature at a higher altitude shows a stronger relationship and that rainfall at lower altitudes shows more impact on the transmission than the rainfall in high altitudinal area\",\"Global climate change and biofuels policy: Indian perspectives\\nAbstract\\nBiofuelled transport is an important aspect of the current bioenergy policy in India.

It is well documented that the Indian coastal areas have been witnessing the negative effects of global warming and climate changes over the last few decades. Sea-water temperature has increased and is projected to increase further in future. As a consequence, the intensity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, heatwave, monsoon and drought are projected (IPCC, IPCC Special Report on Managing of Global Warming, SRREN\\u002fIPPC, 2011).\",\"Climate-forced sea-level lowstands in the Indian Ocean during the last two millennia\\n-\\nFecha2013-02-25\\nPalabras claveCambios clim\\u00e1ticos; Mar; India; Crecimiento; Medio marino; Oc\\u00e9ano \\u00edndico; Estructuras\\nResumenThis paper investigates the influence of climate on sea level in a coastal region of the Western Indian subcontinent, using marine sediment and coral proxies from three coastal lagoons of Goa, India.

Climate change and its impact on water resource availability has been a cause of concern across the world. There are several reports on the impact of climate change at global, regional and local scales. However, in India the assessment and monitoring of impact at local scale is not very common, except in certain regions like the Himalayas where water is already in shortage, and in some coastal areas where sea level rise and cyclones have been impacting the water availability. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology and approach that can assess the effect of climatic change on different water sources like surface water, groundwater, etc. In this chapter an attempt is made to develop an approach, methodology, tools and indicators to assess and monitor the climate impact and associated changes on surface and groundwater resources.

There is a need for a critical examination of the planning of urban greens in the context of adaptation to extreme events. The review aims to explore the role of green in adaptation, the extent of their planning in urban spaces, and to assess their potential contribution to adaptation. We found that urban trees, vegetation and green infrastructure are increasingly considered by local authorities as key elements of climate resilience through urban heat island mitigation, biodiversity conservation, water cycle regulation, urban cooling and air quality improvement. Urban tree-planting programmes are a key adaptation response in India, while green roofs and vegetative green walls are being increasingly implemented at large scale in many Indian and international cities as part of a broader suite of measures to adapt urban environments to future extremes.\\nKeywords: Adaptation; Climate change; Green infrastructure\",\"Mediterranean wave climate variability and its links with NAO and Indian Monsoon in the last 2000 years\\n- ISSN: 16807316\\nAbstract\\nWe present a new proxy for the Mediterranean wave index (MWI) reconstructed using the oxygen isotope ratios of benthic foraminifera from the Ligurian Sea.

Walp.] grown during summer and winter seasons at two locations in North-west Himalayas were evaluated for physicochemical, functional and sensory properties. Cowpeaseeds were harvested from the plots at 50% seed development and 100% pod maturity stages for each season, dried at ambient temperature and ground in to 0.25mm size fraction using a hammer mill. Seed samples were analyzed for proximate composition, mineral content, protein, free amino acid and fat content and the results revealed that the seed protein content was high in both seasons. The seed fat and ash content were found high during the winter season. In general, the moisture content of both cow peaseed varieties was found very low.

(2014)\\nAbstract\\nWe assess the sensitivity of winter wheat yields in the Indian monsoon to past variations in temperature, precipitation and radiation in a historical climatology over India 1871-2011. We find that wheat has been more sensitive to temperature than moisture over the majority of the country, particularly in south-western regions. The sensitivity to moisture has become more important in recent years, with precipitation becoming the main driver of yields. Over the north-east wheat production is more influenced by precipitation, whereas over southwestern India the most important factor is temperature. In the future, we find a decrease for the wheat yield in all regions, and this decline is particularly large for south west India, where wheat is currently most vulnerable to climate change.\",\"Indian Ocean Experiment: An integrated analysis of the climate forcing and effects of the great IndoAsian haze\\n- 1Department of Atmospheric Sciences and Meteorology, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA\\n-.\\nIntroduction\\nThe Asian summer monsoon, also known as the South Asian or Indo-Pacific summer circulation (ISSC), is one of Earth's great natural systems that has a profound impact on the hydrological, atmospheric and oceanic climate of Asia.

We used a model of the global dispersal of mammals to estimate the impact of climate warming on the spread of this species. Our results show that the species is unlikely to expand outside its range unless the climate warms by at least 2.3oC. Climate warming beyond these values would cause the mongose to reach areas with suitable temperature but the lack of suitable prey would limit its expansion further. This is the first time a species has been assessed for its climate suitability by combining global climate and prey species distribution data.

Results suggest that climatic shocks are likely to have more impact on the yields of crops than non climate shocks. In addition, crop specific impacts vary substantially across crops. Climate shocks, particularly precipitation shocks have the largest impact, followed by temperature shocks in case of cereals and pulses and temperature shock in potato production. Other climate variables, such as sunshine hours, are less important for crop yields, although these do affect production in some crops like wheat, rice, cotton and oilseeds..\",\"Climate variability in the southern Indian Ocean as revealed by self-organizing maps\\nAbstract\\nSelf-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are an efficient and flexible technique for visualising multidimensional data, particularly when the data are highly complex; they are also a valuable tool for detecting patterns.

Based on data from 2000-01 to 2014-15, the study reveals the role of migration as an adaptation mechanism in the face of climate risk, especially in light of the recent heat wave in 2020. The findings indicate that the climate shock in summer has increased the propensity of male migrants from the village to migrate to urban destinations. In contrast, female migrants do not change their destination. These results indicate the different coping mechanisms adopted by farmers depending on their gender, age, and education.\\nKeywords\\nDOI:\\nISSN: 1920 \\u2013 4406 (Online)\\nIndexed in AGRIS, CNKI, EBSCO, Google Scholar, CiteFactor and ISC.\",\"Equatorial convergence of India and early Cenozoic climate trends and its implications for India\\u2019s tectonic evolution and geologic development\\nAbstract\\nWe show that the present geotectonics of western India, especially the northward migration of the continental margin, can be explained by an equatorial migration (EM) of Africa from the T-T boundary during the Late Cretaceous. The EM model explains the tensional strain in the western margin of Indian Ocean (\\u003e 30 N) by the collision between Indian and African plates, and also the convergence in India (\\u003c 60 N). We show by numerical modeling of plate boundary migration and the associated mantle plume migration that these two features are consistent with the EM mechanism. We propose that India moved 50 km to the northwest relative to Africa during this time, which is the same order of magnitude as the current separation rate between these continents. In this model, India's north\\u2013south movement and India\\u002fAfrica separation during EM is consistent and can account for the observed convergence between\",\"Possible impacts of Indian Ocean dipole mode events on global climate variability: A review\\nThe Indian\\u2013Ocean Dipole is a natural phenomenon occurring in the Indian and Pacific oceans and its impacts on tropical climate and weather have been the subject of much scrutiny. This phenomenon is characterised by an alternation of warm and cool conditions in both the northern and southern oceans which can have significant impacts in other climatic regions of the planet. The dipoles are thought to have a strong link to the El Ni\\u00f1o\\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and are therefore often used as a proxy for the strength of tropical ENSO activity. It is important to understand the impact that IOD events have on climate as it is believed that these events can influence global surface temperatures for up to several years following the original events. In this review, we summarise the most recent research on the IMD and attempt to quantify the impacts that this event can cause on different atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.\",\"Key findings from the Indian Ocean Climate Initiative and their impact on policy development in Australia\\nAuthor\\nDate2015\\nAbstract\\nAustralia is the world\\u2019s largest coal producer, with exports totalling more than one-fifth of world exports. In 2014, Australia was the largest exporter of coal globally and the third-largest exporter in 2002. Australia is also one of the highest emitters of carbon dioxide in the industrialised world (IPCC, 1993). Australia has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian Government has a number of international obligations to limit its greenhouse gas emissions in order to help curb climate change. This includes a commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below \\u2018business-as-usual\\u2019 levels by the year 2020. It is expected that the current Australian emissions profile will be in excess of 50 million tons of CO2-eq [1] by that date.

The results indicate a close link between the SLP of the ITCZ, SSS and Indian EPO. During the warm phase of E-S (1998, 2002) there was an increase in both SLS and SLAI and a decrease in SSAI, while during the cold phase (~1990), a significant increase was observed in all the parameters and there were no significant difference in any of them.

The floods caused significant damage to crops and pastures, and also to human life. At least 15 people were reported dead.\\nThis event has had a direct, but also indirect, impact on the livelihoods and food security of pastoralists living around the lake basins. In the East-African Great Lakes region, the floods are part of a climate crisis that has been ongoing for several years. This crisis includes droughts, floods, cyclones, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions, with negative consequences on agricultural and livestock production, health systems and infrastructure.

However, these consequences are difficult for researchers and policy-makers to evaluate and manage due to the complex interplay of processes in dynamic coastal systems. We developed a coupled 2D\\u20133 D modelling approach to investigate the influence of a coastal protection structure on a complex coastal setting. Our approach integrates 24 years of bathymetry data and 12 years (\\u003c10m resolution) of high-resolution (\\u003e1m) topography data collected along the ~20 km long Goplpur coastline, India. The results suggest that the structure acts as a barrier, trapping waves and sediment along its northern flank during storm events, thereby increasing shoreline erosion in the area. At the same time, the southern end of the coast, without the protection wall, shows a high erosion\",\"The unequal effects of weather and climate change: Evidence from mortality in India\\nAbstractThis paper estimates the effects that extreme weather events and temperature changes have on life expectancy at birth in rural villages in northern India using microdata on mortality collected in the National Sample Survey from 1977 to 2006. The results suggest that the mortality impact of heat waves is larger than that of droughts. This result holds for both the rural and urban villages. However, mortality from floods has a larger impact than does drought on the urban sample. A larger share of the increase in total population in villages is in low-rainfall areas during extreme events than during drought. In general, the impact on rural villagers is much larger for high temperatures than for drought, and for floods than drought; and vice versa for urban villagers. For rural areas, heat wave mortality impacts are larger in states with high levels of population density. Flood mortality increases faster in areas with higher population densities.): 8 (\",\"Indian Ocean circulation and climate variability on inter-annual to multi-decadal time scales\\n- 1Institute of Earth Sciences, Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht (HZG), Leibniz Institute for Coastal Zone Research, 21502 Geeste, Germany\\nCorrespondence: Stefan Rahmstorf [email protected]\\nThe Indian Ocean has a strong influence on global climate through a large-scale heat exchange with the atmosphere. Its circulation is driven by the monsoons, which are the dominant mode of tropical ocean-atmosphere interaction. The monsoon circulation can be strongly modulated by external forcing, for example in response to changes in the atmospheric circulation due to greenhouse warming. In a recent study we have shown that the circulation in model simulations of the twentieth century is modelled realistically, but that there are large deviations from a realistic circulation that occur on multiyear to centennial time scale, and can only be explained by a non-\",\"Indian summer monsoon precipitation climatology in a high-resolution regional climate model: Impacts of convective parameterization on systematic biases and climate variability in China\\n- 1State Key Laboratory on Cryospheric Science, CASIA, Beijing, China (mengjf@mail.cau.edu.cn)\\nThe summer Indian monsoonal precipitation system in northern China is characterized by a strong southward extension of the subtropical jet, with a maximum in convections in the warm sector during June\\u2013August [Wu et al., J.

The glass industry in India has come up with some new technologies in manufacturing glass, such as insulating glass to reduce heat transfer, low iron and low E glass for solar control etc.\\nWith a wide spectrum of glass options available, it is essential to select appropriate glass in order to achieve the desired performance for the application. In order for a particular glass option to perform optimally, its energy efficiency, thermal performance should be taken into consideration. Thermal performance of a building is one of the essential factors for achieving energy saving and sustainable building, and hence energy ratings is given by the government of India.

We analyse how issues are framed by the print press, how the coverage varies over time and whether the climate debate influences media reporting on other environmental issues. By using a quantitative text analysis of all climate articles in three national newspapers over a period of almost two decades, we find that the frequency of coverage and the framing of the issue differ markedly from one country to the next and that media reports on climate in Germany have become increasingly prominent. However, our analysis shows that coverage in India is relatively stable and Australian media report on the problem of global warming at a similar rate as before.

This programme was first announced in 1940, by the then prime minister of Independent India, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. The aim was to make India totally self-reliant on the manufacture of defense products and systems. It was a very ambitious plan, as at that time, there were no manufacturing industries for defense goods in India. In 1957, the programme became a law in parliament.

In order to address and handle these complex and dynamic situations there is a requirement of a holistic view of security.\\nWith the changing scenario, it is imperative that the Indian Armed Forces be made to respond in a manner in which they are able to meet the challenges of present and future scenarios. As a first step, the concept of \\u2018High Defence Management with Indian Characteristics\\u2019 [HDMIC), was developed. A high defence manager is the one who has a broad vision of how the armed forces should be organised, trained and equipped; and who is able and willing to provide a lead to the system to evolve and improve itself. The HDM-IC concept evolved out of an assessment of Indian needs and capabilities to ensure that India is better able than at present to deal with complex threats\",\"building semantically annotated corpus for text classification of indian defence news articles\\nDate2020\\nAuthor\\nSharma, P.\\nKumar, S. S\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThe present paper presents a novel approach to build a semantic annotated text corpus, based on a large number of documents, for the purpose of developing a classifier that can be used to classify the text documents based upon their semantics. The annotated data set consists of a set of defense related articles which are classified as positive\\u002fnegative and a manually curated corpus based from a corpus mining tool. These two corpora are further used for building the semantic annotated corporal for use in a machine learning algorithm for developing an accurate classifier. In the present study, we use the LSI based approach for feature selection to select the relevant features to be considered while training the model and then, used a Random forest classifier to develop the classifier for both the corporals.

In the 1950s and 60s, India's defence requirements were supplied by indigenous manufacturers such as the Aircraft Factory at Nasik.

It was also felt that in the long term, such an arrangement with Russia would enable Indian firms to acquire the requisite technology to produce sophisticated weaponry.

This has been evident in recent years as the bilateral defence ties between the two countries have grown. The two governments have concluded two landmark defence cooperation agreements since the end of the Cold War, and have been actively engaged in joint training and exercises. India is now the largest importer of US arms. Moreover, as part of a larger trend across the Asia Pacific, US and Indian military forces are increasingly engaged bilaterally through the 'two-plus-two' ministerial dialogue and other military-to-military initiatives.

This transition is a product of a number of historical factors which include a combination of factors such as its geography, demography and economic development which have shaped its security environment - a factor that has played a significant role in determining the nature of its foreign policy and national security priorities.

The paper began by reviewing the history of Indo-Australian Defence Relations, with particular reference to post 1990. In the first 30 years of bilateral relations, Australia had been a major provider of military assistance to India, particularly following Independence in 1947. However, after 1972, when India's relations with the USA were normalised, the bilateral military ties began to deteriorate as Australia became a close ally of the US and its military links with India diminished. Following the end of India?s nuclear tests in May 2008, Indo Australian bilateral defence ties were revived and the relationship has grown steadily.

It has also seen an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in its defense sector. However, the defense industry has been considered to be a strategic sector, and therefore, a significant barrier has remained in the way of foreign investments. This has not only hindered growth of Indian defense manufacturing sector but has created a gap in technology and capabilities in comparison with the developed countries. The present paper attempts to review the present status of FDI in defense in India and its trends, requirements and the forecast. A critical review of available literature, reports and data has enabled the authors to identify the factors responsible for the low F DI inflows into defense and to understand that there is a strong case for allowing F I DI in certain categories in Indian defence industry.\",\"indian missile defence development \\u2013 google.com.au\\nindia is developing its indigenously built missile defense system that can intercept short- range ballistic missiles from its neighbors, according the defense ministry. the missile system has a range of 40 to 80 kilometer and can be used to intercept incoming ballistic missile, the ministry said in a statement.\\nIndia developing missile to take out Pak\\u2019s nukes: Report\\nThe indiamart.co.in\\nthe indian missile development programme will soon have the capacity to destroy all types of ballistic and cruise missiles, indianspace.org reported citing defense scientists. \\\"we will have this capability to attack all varieties of missile in 2015,\\\" the report quoted a scientist as \\u2026\\nIndian missile capable of destroying Pakistani n-warhead: report\\nTimes of india\\nmumbai: india's indiasab.wordpress. com\\na ballistic missil e developed indi a can now destroy \\u2018n-t\",\"right to private defence in india\\nAbout\\nPortfolio\\nContacts\\n[9][page needed], The right to self-defence was upheld by the Privy Council in the 1885 case of State of Bombay v.

These are the reasons for the rupees fall, but the question which arises is why has the dollar appreciated. Is the appreciation a result of higher demand and supply of currencies. The answer is not quite correct, for it is the demand for dollars that causes appreciation of dollar and vice versa. This is because dollar is used as a benchmark for pricing commodity prices. It is therefore, the increase in demand of commodities for which the price has increased. In other words it means that there was more demand. As a currency it has its value. And the more the value of a particular currency, it will be more attractive for foreign investors and traders. So as we know that the higher the values the lesser is its cost\",\"The new cold war and the rise of the 21stcentury infrastructure state, part iii\\nThe cold War and U.S. foreign (1st ed.), 2008, p 6\\n(6) This is a quote by Henry Kissinger, one of many prominent political and intellectual leaders of American foreign policy during the Cold War.

The work is based on the theoretical framework of Network Analysis, and specifically on Social Network, a sub discipline of network Analysis. In recent years, Social networks are being applied successfully in various fields of research such as, sociology, psychology, political science, business, etc. However, the application of Social network theory has not been used extensively in the area of security, defence and counter terrorism. This work focuses on social networks as a tool for identifying the network of terrorists and their supporters, for predicting the next attack, detecting the terrorists in a network and also for tracking the movement of the terrorist across different cities.\\nIn this paper, two case studies of Indian defense are studied. Both cases are from Maharashtra and are related to the Indian Army and Indian Intelligence agency.

The Indian Army has its own independent military, but has close cooperation with the Malaysian Armed Forces, especially in training. Indian defence cooperation and strategic partnership with Malaysia was formalised in 2012 with a \\\"Strategic Cooperation Agreement\\\". The Malaysian Air Force (Malay: Perancangan Udara Malaysia) is currently the air force of the Royal Malaysian Navy.It is headquartered at Subang, Selangor, Malaysia.The air arms primary mission is to support the Navy with air surveillance and combat air patrols as well as to protect Malaysian airspace. It is an air arm of Royal Australian Navy based at Nowra. In 1990, both countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding to establish defence ties.

The use of military assistance has historically been limited to a few situations such as post-conflict or fragile states, although a number of donors have begun to consider military aid for development purposes.\\nA recent report commissioned by the Swedish International Development Agency and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs examines the possible use and impact of a military component within a broader peacebuilding assistance strategy. It examines how military assets could be used to promote peace and security by assisting rural communities to manage the impacts of armed violence and insecurity. A number the key issues examined by this report are explored in further detail in this article.

In fact, according to a report prepared by an NGO, a third (33 %) of India \\u2019s annual budget of Rs 1,20,000 crores is currently spent on the armed forces, with only 7 % of these funds being used for modernisation.

It also discusses the political and social factors that contributed to the emergence of insurgency in Northeast, and the nature of counter-insurgency, which, according to some accounts, is even more ruthless and indiscriminate than the conflict itself.

It is concerned with the changing nature of British intelligence activities within the Indian empire. At the end of World War 1, Britain was in possession of one of its largest overseas territories. In the period between 1918 and 1922, the British government had to grapple not only with a vast number of domestic issues such as a labour movement, an economic recession and a constitutional crisis, but also the challenge to its authority of a growing nationalist movement.

While some argue that defense spending should increase to keep up with the ever increasing threat of terrorism, others believe that spending more on defense can be counterproductive and lead to a situation where defense budget is used for purposes other than defence like development of infrastructure etc. and the economy is not benefited.\\nDefence spending is also a source of concern for many developing countries like India, which has to balance the need for modernization of its military to meet the rising security challenges posed by China and Pakistan.

This vision has been largely supported by US allies and allies-in-arms in Europe, North America and Asia. But the US-India alliance has become a test case for this vision in recent times. The two countries are seen by many as natural partners in the quest for global liberalism, with their shared values of democracy, pluralism and secularism underpinning their respective visions.

The Gujarat riot was a major turning point in the Indian security establishment as it led to significant changes in defence policy and reforms. While it is widely acknowledged that post the Gujarat violence the government of India took a more proactive approach towards defence planning, the manner in which it has been implemented remains a matter of debate and criticism. This paper examines the nature of post \\u2013 Gujarat reforms and highlights the limitations of the reforms that have emerged. These include the lack of strategic vision and the failure of institutional reforms at the level of military and civilian leadership.\\nIt is important to note the role of political leadership in implementing reforms, as defence is essentially a political subject.

India's defence industry has also been unable to meet the requirements of the defence services. There is a growing perception that the procurement practices in the Indian defence forces may be contributing to an increase in defence imports, especially from the Western defence equipment suppliers. However, the issue of defence production in this country remains highly contested. The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology that will allow defence suppliers to make a better estimation on the total cost of ownership of a system.

India did not have the financial resources to develop its own nuclear technology, nor was India capable of building nuclear warheads without the help of an outside country. This was due to the fact that a significant percentage of the country\\u2019\\u2019 military equipment was manufactured in the United States at the end of World War II, making India reliant on Washington. In addition, India relied upon American technology to help develop nuclear weaponry. Finally, since the 1950\\u2019\\u2019, India had maintained an agreement with the U.S to buy its nuclear fuel.

The question whether it is really necessary for the defence of a country like India or the funds could be used for other development purposes like health, education etc. has been debated for a long time.

In the last decade, the ratio of defence expenditure to the GDP has increased from an average of 5.8 per cent in pre-reform period (1971-75) to an all time high of around 6.6 percent in recent years.

The Armed forces are a major consumer of energy and also a large polluter. In order for the armed forces to achieve a carbon-neutral status, there are many challenges that need to be overcome. These include a lack of political will, a poor knowledge base of the Armed force personnel about climate-change and energy-security risks, low levels of awareness and understanding of climate change and related issues among the general population, high levels and costs of fuel consumption, and a limited capacity to innovate and deploy new technology.

The DDP is the most important defence procurement procedure and the main document which governs the defence acquisition process. The Defence Procurement Manual 2013 : A Guide for Procurers is a compendium of the policies and guidelines relating to defence procurements by the Ministry of Defence. Defence acquisition is responsible for procurement of various items required for military operations. This is done by procuring these items from the Indian private sector and foreign suppliers. Procurement of items through this process is also done through the Defence Public sector undertakings.

PPP in infrastructure model in india post-COVID-19 pandemic\\nAbstractThis paper analyses the PPP infrastructure projects in the post COVID- 19 scenario. It focuses on the challenges that PPP projects are facing due to Covid-induced economic slowdown and lockdown. This analysis is based on primary data collected from the stakeholders and government officials who are involved with PPP models in India. The challenges in PPP project due COVID -2019 are identified on different parameters such as project funding, project implementation and operations and maintenance. Based on these challenges, the paper highlights the need of restructuring of PPP model to ensure that the projects can sustain and provide long term benefits for the society. In order to overcome the financial hurdles in project development, it is suggested that government should introduce PPP policy with a focus on financing and debt management. Government should also provide incentives for investment in infra.

The Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 (\\u201cthe 1976 Act\\u201d) and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (2015) \\u201cthe Act\\u201d have been the two most important laws on arbitration in the country since India became a Republic.\\nIn 2016, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry introduced the construction sector dispute resolution (\\\"CSDR\\\") Scheme, under which, disputes arising out of a construction contract are to be referred to a single arbitrator. This arbitral process is meant to ensure speedy resolution of disputes in a cost effective manner with a minimum of interference by the Courts. In India, arbitration has been accepted as a preferred method of dispute redressal. While, in many cases, there is a need of an alternative means of adjudication and adjudications have resulted\",\"Examining the interlinkages between regional infrastructure disparities, economic growth, and poverty: A case of Indian States\\n- 4 Downloads\\nAbstract\\nIn spite of the fact that the development and growth of a region depend on various factors such as geographical location, natural resources, availability of human resources and infrastructure, the region with better infrastructure tends to attract more investments leading to rapid economic and industrial growth. Hence, it has been observed that there is a positive and significant correlation between infrastructure development in a country and economic development, with the former being the driving force behind economic progress. The present study aims at identifying and explaining the impact of infrastructure on poverty, in Indian states. It uses a time series data for the period 2000\\u20132014, collected from the official statistics of government sources and other reliable secondary sources. We employ both ordinary and structural causality tests to test the hypothesised relationship.

The government has been unable to provide infrastructure for all eligible schools. We show that the lack of infrastructure at schools in India has an adverse effect on enrolment, especially for girls. In particular, the likelihood of a girl attending school is negatively affected when the number of students in a school exceeds 25, while the probability of attending for boys is higher for larger classes. Our results are robust to different measures of class size and school infrastructure. Moreover, we document a positive correlation between the enrol.\\n- David E.

The government, as part of its policy objectives, is also taking several steps to improve the financing of projects by private and public sectors, and to increase private investment in infrastructure. However, there is a need to take further steps for increasing public spending in the infrastructure area, especially in sectors which face significant financing challenges, such as power, roads, water and sanitation, housing, transport, etc.\",\"Financing private infrastructure: lessons from India's PPP experience\\nThis paper describes a framework for assessing whether or not the project is a viable proposition.

A theoretical model has been constructed and econometric analyses have been conducted to examine the relationship between the three variables. The study period is 1990s - 2011 for which data from the national statistical office and the Planning Commission are used. It is established that infrastructure growth \\u2013 in particular transport infrastructure -- is an important driver for economic performance in the Indian economy. Infrastructure spending has a positive impact on economic output. However, the impact of infrastructure spending on GDP growth rate in urban areas is negative in contrast to the positive effects in rural areas. In order to improve the economic efficiency of urban transport investments, there is a need to increase the share of road investments. This can be achieved by reducing non-tax revenues and increasing the efficiency): 7(201\",\"An infrastructure review of public bicycle sharing system (PBSS): global and Indian scenario\\nAbstract\\nA bicycle-sharing is a system which facilitates the short-term usage of bicycles by multiple people and is an emerging mode of transport. The PBSS are a combination of bicycle, docking station and a management system for a bike-rental service. There are different types of docking stations, which include fixed docking, free floating, and smart docking systems. PBRS can play a crucial role in improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion, providing a viable alternative to private automobile ownership, encouraging exercise, supporting local and national tourism and improving the quality of life in cities by providing an additional transportation option. This paper discusses the existing infrastructure of PBST in the global cities. Then the PB systems are analyzed based on the parameters of cost, efficiency. And finally, the conclusion is drawn that the current PB infrastructure is very less in India when compared to the other countries.

In India, infrastructure investments by the foreign investors have been increasing over 30 per cent per annum from 2000 to 2015. India is an agrarian country where agriculture sector is the backbone of economic growth and development. The government of India has taken various steps for developing the agricultural sector and for improving the agriculture productivity. This research work aims to examine foreign direct investments into agriculture and non-agriculture sectors and also investigates the effect of foreign investment inflows on agriculture production. Using time series data over a period of 20 years, the paper examines the impact of FDI on nonagricultural sectors on agricultural productivity in both short and long run and estimates the parameters in the system by using a dynamic system model to understand the long term and short term dynamics between the\",\"Climatic zones and rural housing in India: implications for rural poverty reduction strategies\\nThis paper examines the relationship between climatic zones, rural household poverty and the type of housing. It uses a nationally representative data set on households from India's Rural Household Survey (RHS). The empirical results indicate that households residing in the tropical zone are poorer and have lower access to sanitation, education and improved health facilities as compared to households in other climatic regions. However, the results of the multinomial logit analysis show that the association between the climatic zone and poverty depends, to a large extent, on the nature of household housing - i.e. whether the household is urban'slum' dwelling or rural dwelling. The results suggest that rural \\\"non-slums\\\" and slums are the poorest, and urban dwelling is the richest. A policy recommendation from the paper is that to reduce rural and, in particular, slum-related poverty, housing improvement, especially in non-\",\"United StatesIndia collaborative research directions in urban housing and supporting infrastructure\\n- The Urban Institute and the Centre for Habitat and Policy Studies will hold a conference to discuss the research needs and collaborative partnerships to address urban development issues.\\nThe Centre of Policy Research (CPR) and The Habitat Centre will be organising a one-day conference on 21 February 2009 to explore the collaborative possibilities for a long standing joint research project with the Urban-Institute and to develop a framework for future collaborative initiatives for research into key urban policy issues in India.

In response to this, they have developed a system based on self-supply of water through private wells and cisterns, often located in shared spaces. The study uses ethnography and participatory mapping to examine how the urban water system has been organised and governed through the private sector and by local government, in a poor neighbourhood. Drawing on the theoretical concepts of legal geographies, the study reveals how water infrastructure and the water service are divided between public and private sectors in informal settlements, and how this division is a result of the exclusion of public infrastructure in these communities.\\nDescription\\nCitation : Goggin, S. and Sridharan, K.

The recent rapid growth of urban infrastructure has been instrumental for the economic progress of these regions. In this paper, we empirically assess the impact of infrastructure spending on population density for 27 major cities of the country. A panel data approach was adopted for this study and the results reveal significant positive association between the level of spending and density of population in cities. We also find a positive relationship between density and other parameters like population, per capita income, literacy, and health expenditure. However, there exists an insignificant association at the national level.

Using a panel data set, the study analyses the effect of these public interventions on the distribution of income among rural households in a sample of Indian states and among households of different wealth groups over the period 1973\\u20132000. The results show that, although the overall distribution has become more unequal, provision and investment in basic public infrastructure have reduced inequality among rich households, but not among poor ones. Public infrastructure investments have been more beneficial to poor people in states with high levels of per capita income in the pre-reforms era. In contrast, there is no impact at all on poor families in high-performing states.\\n- S. V.

It focuses on the investments in grid and non-grid infrastructure, as well as on their impact on electricity consumption, agricultural growth, and poverty. The results show that infrastructure spending has a positive effect on per household electricity demand. Infrastructure investments also have a strong impact in terms of their multiplier effect, both in the electricity sector, which is the focus of the analysis, but also on agricultural productivity and rural poverty reduction. These results are consistent with the notion that electricity generation, in turn, leads to the creation of productive uses of labour and thus increases economic activity.\\nThe study concludes that investment on energy infrastructure can improve the living standards of people in rural areas, while generating employment in urban areas. This has been achieved by a significant increase in agricultural output and a decline in poverty levels.

The researchers, including the authors, found that poor access to urban public transport and a lack of road infrastructure in rural areas has led to the creation of rural ghettos with high levels of unemployment and low levels economic development and social mobility. In fact, poor and infrequent transport in urban areas was one of four key factors that led people to make the decisions where to live as well as where not to go. According to co-author Dr. Sangeetha Narayanan, these findings have significant implications for urban planning\",\"Infrastructure development and economic growth in India \\u2013 The role of the private sector\\nThe infrastructure sector has been an area where the Indian economy has witnessed considerable investments. In the last decade, the infrastructure investments, public and private, have gone up from Rs 2.8 lakh crore to Rs. 9.2 lakh crores. The public infrastructure expenditure has risen from 1% of GDP in 1991-92 to 3% in recent years.

It also investigates if these perceptions differ depending on whether communities are members of the dominant Aruna tribe, the indigenous Gaddi tribe or the Bodo tribe. We argue that the nature of perceptions differs for communities that are differentially located on the same land. Using 24 in-depth interviews of people from all three communities, as well as 11 focus group discussions, we found that communities differed in their attitudes depending whether or not members were from the Arna tribe; Arunas are more likely to be supportive of infrastructure. This is because the project has direct benefits for the community. In contrast, Gadis and Bodos are less supportive and more opposed to the development. However, Bodes are also likely beneficiaries of this infrastructure as a\",\"Political economy of infrastructure spending in India: A political economy perspective\\nAbstract\\nInfrastructure is the backbone of the Indian economy as it provides a wide platform for growth of various economic sectors. There is a strong consensus that the infrastructure development in the country has been lagging behind in comparison to the global scenario. It is observed that there has not been much investment in infrastructure, in spite of high growth rate witnessed in recent years. In this context a detailed analysis of Indian infrastructure sector has become necessary. This paper is an attempt to study the political factors behind India\\u2019s infrastructural development. The analysis reveals that political factor is one of major factors influencing the growth in infrastructurals in Indian scenario; however, the extent of political influence varies with infrastructure type and its sub-type. Infrastructure sector is found more sensitive to political changes in power and political parties have been using infrastructure for gaining political mileage.\\nKeywords\\nReferences\\nAgarwal, R.

A review of current adaptive design and construction practices in higher eduction institutes was carried out to assess the state of adaptation in this area. These practices were then evaluated based on a set of indicators to identify gaps in adaptive capacity in Indian educational infrastructure design practice. The identified gaps were assessed for current practices, as well as for future adaptation requirements. This analysis was followed by a discussion of potential adaptive pathway opportunities in urban India and suggested measures for improving disaster resilience. It is concluded that adaptive educational practices are still nascent in many parts of India. Current and emerging practices require greater attention from educational stakeholders as part of an adaptive strategy for infrastructure for the disaster risk and climate change era to develop.\\nKeywords\\nDOI:\",\"Road transport infrastructure and economic growth in India: the role of highways\\nThis paper analyzes the impact of road transport infrastructures on the economic performance of the country, using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model.

We use the model to explore the impacts of increasing road investments on growth, employment, productivity, and energy consumption. Our findings suggest that improving road quality is crucial, especially for improving transport efficiency. This implies that investments in roads need to be made with more consideration paid to the quality-adjusted costs and benefits of investments. Moreover, the positive link between infrastructure investments and GDP indicates the importance of investing in new transport systems.

The global infrastructure deficit stands at $90 trillion by 2030, according to the OECD, of which over 40% is in developing countries. While a large part of the shortfall is accounted for by a lack of funding, poor governance also plays a significant role. At the same time, infrastructure projects are increasingly seen as vehicles for development, and the importance of public-private-partnerships, especially in emerging markets, has grown substantially. In this environment of limited resources and greater expectations of infrastructure development in low-income economies, a new approach to governance is emerging.

However, there has not been a corresponding growth in road networks in urban areas and the existing roads have not seen much maintenance. The construction and maintenance of the roads in a country like India is one of its most significant development issues, but little attention has so far been paid to the impacts of roads on local communities living nearby. In India, many people are affected by road construction projects, and a growing literature shows that the environmental, economic and social impacts are not well managed. This paper examines the issue of environmental injustice from the perspective of those who are directly affected. It analyses the case of a proposed road development in Delhi, India that was to be built in an area with low economic status.

The recent turn to financial markets to finance infrastructure projects has resulted in a proliferation of new financial instruments such as Public Private Partnerships, Public-Private Partnership Bonds, Social Investment Bonds and Special Purpose Entities. These new financing mechanisms and financial intermediaries such the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank have been used to attract public funds and mobilize private investment through the use of innovative financial structures. However, these new mechanisms have not been accompanied with the political reforms which would allow for the development of a public infrastructure market. This paper explores the implications of this turn, focusing specifically on three countries: India, Kenya and Colombia. It draws on case studies to explore the ways in which the financial turn has affected the politics of infrastructure and public debt.

A theoretical framework is constructed by incorporating the concept of investment complementarity and the role of public infrastructure investment and credit. The results indicate that the availability of better infrastructure significantly increases the agricultural production by 2.4 times. Furthermore, agricultural credit also has a positive influence on productivity. These results suggest that investment on infrastructure is an important determinant of productivity in the Indian.\\n- Koopman, S. & van den Bergh, J. J., 2001..

The study aims to identify factors that affect the delivery of infrastructure development projects. In addition, the research aims at identifying the factors affecting the duration of such projects, in order to help government and policy makers in the development of an effective policy. A structured questionnaire was developed and sent to 50 experts. Experts were also asked to provide inputs on the questionnaire in three stages. After the first stage, 40 responses were received. This was followed by a second stage where 20 experts were interviewed for validation. 10 of these responses have been excluded for analysis. Delphi technique was used to obtain the remaining 60 responses. It was found that lack of coordination is the single most important factor affecting delay in project implementation. Other factors identified as important were poor project appraisal, poor planning, lack in human resources, inadequate project management, financial crisis, and lack or insufficient monitoring\\u002f evaluation.\",\"Cold Chain Infrastructure for Frozen Food: A Weak Link in Indian Retail Sector.\\n- 2nd Edition\\nThe Cold Chain infrastructure in India is in a poor condition.

The rural households in this study are selected from a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 households that is representative of India's rural population. Banking outreach is defined as the number of branches per 1000 people residing in a district. It is found that a 10% increase in the banking coverage in districts leads to a higher probability of having a formal bank account for the households. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that banking services are complementary. However, the study also reveals a significant impact of branch density on formal savings. These savings are found to be positively correlated with branch densities as well as with banking penetration in rural India.\",\"emerging structure of the indian economy and its impact on employment, growth and development\\n- (PDF) A Study of Impact of Infrastructure on\\n(1) Infrastructure development plays a crucial role in the economic growth of any economy.

We use a unique, comprehensive, and nationally representative survey (National Family Health Survey-four, NFCS-IV) to analyze the coverage of various immunization services, access to public hospitals with emergency services and the quality of public health facilities in these rural regions. In the analysis, we also control for the state of health and demographic characteristics of people to capture the heterogeneity of the region within India and to isolate the impact of these facilities from the other determinants. The key findings are that the states with low human capital and poor demographic outcomes have low coverage and quality in terms of immunization programs. Also the access, quality and cost of care in public sector hospitals is better in states which have high human development. Thus health service infrastructure is a critical determinant of coverage, accessibility and health outcomes\",\"Improving access to water supply and sanitation in urban India: microfinance for water and sanitation infrastructure development\\nThe study examines the extent to which access has been improved through microcredit in selected districts. The study focuses on the provision of access by private companies and households to the water sector. It examines whether the poor have been helped and whether access is sustainable. Access to safe water has increased in all districts except two. Water quality has improved and the number of users has grown in most cases. Private companies have played an important role in providing access for some groups, especially the urban poor. However, in other places, the state, NGOs and community organizations have provided a larger proportion of the infrastructure. This shows that there has not been a clear shift towards the private sector in the sector as a whole. Households have benefited from microcredits in terms of increased access, improved sanitation levels and improved quality of water. There are a number factors that explain why the results of micro credits do not translate into access.\",\"Infrastructure development: a publicprivate partnership in India\\nDate2020\\nAuthor\\nRai, Poonam\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThe infrastructure sector in Indian has been witnessing a major transformation with the advent of liberalization and globalization.

In this thesis I explore the implications of this phenomenon in three Asian countries - India, China, and Bangladesh. I look at the challenges of infrastructure development, governance issues of land and environment, gender and class dynamics and their implications on urban growth. These issues have been explored in a historical perspective in each country. The focus is on the last two decades as a period of URB in these countries. India has undergone a rapid growth of urban population from 30% in 1991 to 37.7% 2011. This has brought along its own set of challenges, particularly for the poor.

This paper examines the impact of the quality of transport infrastructure, and electricity generation capacity on the growth of per capita income in 12 South Asian countries using annual time series data. The paper first estimates the effects of different components of capital stocks on economic growth and then examines how much of these effects can be explained by infrastructure. A structural model is used to identify the relative importance of each component of growth-infrastructure and the other factors such as labour, land, human capital and capital. It is found that the infrastructure stock explains a significant portion of economic performance: on average 22 percent of annual real GDP growth over the last three decades can attributed to infrastructure and 14 percent to the stock of physical capital in the economy. These findings indicate that developing Asian economies can improve their growth performance through better infrastructure development.\\n- R.

The Role of Political Instability\\nThe role of political instability is explored through a panel data of 32 Indian states for the period 1901-2004. We find that the infrastructure performance of the least-developed states increases when political parties change and the number of coalition governments falls, while it declines when the political system remains stable. The results suggest that coalition parties and stable government may increase the risk of corruption and lead to more political rents for politicians, which in turn may reduce public investment. These results are robust to a variety of specifications and empirical strategies. They also remain significant after controlling for economic factors and other institutional differences such as land use regulation, and after the inclusion of lagged and lag-squared infrastructure indicators in the analysis.\",\"Logistic management-a case study with special reference on physical infrastructure, logistics & transportation (with special emphasis on transportation management) 1 \\u002f 5.

It provides a platform to connect people and businesses and enables trade to flourish. This study aims to analyse the economic benefits to rural and regional development from the improvement of infrastructure by assessing the impact of different categories of roads. The study focuses on the road infrastructures of rural areas. In the Indian context there was the need to assess the benefits accruing to agricultural growth in rural India. Hence the study also focused on agriculture in general and the role of agriculture to improve the quality of life of the rural people as well as on its role in the economy. For these reasons a study is carried out to examine the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth of two states, Karnataka and India, and to evaluate their performance in infrastructure.

The result implies that infrastructure development, in turn, enhances economic development and foreign investment. However, the effect of foreign influsions on domestic investment is insignificant. Moreover, we test the significance of the causal relationship between investment-GDP and between FIRD and growth and find significant long term relation between the two, implying that foreign FIPs have a significant and positive impact on economic: 1257-1261\\nContact details of provider:\\nWeb page: in: Empirical Economics \",\"Territory, roads and trans-boundary Rivers: An analysis of Indian infrastructure building along the Sino-Indian border in Arunachal Pradesh\\nBy\\nShiv Shankarsinh Chauhan,\\nArjun Dev\\nFirst Online:\\nReceived:\",\"transforming waste into resources for the indian economy, the first step in waste management is to generate the least amount of waste possible. we must try to make our products and packaging recyclable or reusable, and reduce the amount and weight of our waste wherever possible..\\nThe main waste disposal system in the uk is the \\u201cblack bin\\u201d which is emptied every week. the contents are taken to the recycling centre and separated by hand. in addition, a 4-weekly \\u2018green\\u2019 bin is collected for recycling, including food, paper, plastic and cardboard items. these two bins make up the waste collection service in scotland.\\nwaste management in construction. a guide to reducing, reusing, recycling and disposing of construction and demolition waste (cdw) in england and wales - 2012 edition. this guide is for those working in and around the construction industry: architects, developers, contractors, builders, surveyors, waste managers and environmental consultants\",\"Place-based public investment in regional infrastructure, the locational choice of firms and regional performance: the case of India\\nThis paper examines the impact of public investments in infrastructure on the location choices, firm performance as well as the economic performance of regions.

The objective of the present study is therefore, to study the various modes through which airports in different countries of Asia and South-East Asia have been privatised. In recent decades, the airports and the aviation industry have undergone significant changes as part of privatisations in various countries in Asia. As a result, airports have become an integral part in any citys economy. This study examines the different models that have adopted in privatizing different airports through the world. It also examines various issues and challenges encountered in implementing privatizations and suggests measures that can be undertaken.\\nBibliographical Information:\\nAdvisor:Verma, R.P.C.; Srivastava, P.K.M.D.T.S.; Gupta, J.N.; Bhattach\",\"Scenario of viability gap funding (VGF) concept in Indian infrastructure projects- a case study\\nThis study presents the results of an empirical analysis of the VGF scheme implemented by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in the Indian state.

It has been found that the level of income per capita in a region has positive correlation with the amount of road infrastructure and the number of kilowatts of electricity produced. However, the effects of these two types of infrastructural development on economic growth are different.

Our observations of this system are based on the work of other authors on NDSIs, and on an analysis of documents that describe and describe implementation plans. As a result of our observations, we discuss a number of characteristics and processes that appear in NSSDI implementation that we describe as the rainbow characteristics of implementation, based primarily on work by Gatre and Gogte in their studies of national databases for water resources and rural development in Maharashtra, India.\",\"Policy actions for developing the infrastructure sector: Learnings from the Indian experience - 1\\nThe Government's push towards infrastructure development is well known by now. The focus has been not only on infrastructure sectors such as highways, railways, ports and urban development, but also on sectors like airports, power, telecom and oil & gas. In 2007-08, the overall outlay on the physical infrastructure was Rs 3.2 lakh crore, with public sector share amounting to 50 per cent.\\nGiven the critical nature of infrastructure, its development has also been given top priority by several countries in the world. As a result, in a relatively long period, countries have made significant progress in this regard. There are many factors to these achievements, including a large public expenditure, high levels of investment from both public and private sectors and the availability of adequate technical manpower. However, a common feature of all infrastructure-led development models is the need to have a supportive framework, and a policy and administrative system that\",\"Quality Measurements and Relevant Indian Infrastructure: A Critical Appraisal\\nAbstractThe 1997-1998 financial year, the Ministry of Finance has initiated an effort to introduce performance measurement in the public infrastructure sectors.

It is found that the overall capital stock in these sectors is rising at a fast pace, with the highest growth rates being observed in transportation and communication sectors of about 7-8 per cent per annum. However, the growth in Kc is declining steadily for all sectors since 1986-87 with an exception of construction sector for which it is still increasing.

The study is undertaken by using panel ordinary least square, fixed effect regression model. Empirical results suggest that the government's expenditure and the size of infrastructure are significant determinants in PPP. In addition, the study also reveals that in case of road projects, government spending, and size are positive while government borrowing and project location are negative. Further, it is found that government expenditure, project size and bank finance have significantly and positively impact on the PPP in roads sector.\\nThe study concludes that there should be a greater emphasis on improving project management and financial management in order to promote PPPs.

Using a vector error-correction method, we investigate the role of infrastructure in the growth of output in different regions of India, and the contribution of the different components of capital input to the output of different infrastructure sectors. Our findings reveal that the elasticity of growth in infrastructure to its output is higher for capital and less so for labor. We find that there is a strong positive relationship between growth rates of regional GDP and infrastructure. Further, the regional differences in infrastructural inputs for a given level of GDP indicate that infrastructure is not equally important for every sector in all the regions. This finding is particularly true for the power sector; in fact, infrastructure investment in this sector is much less important in certain states. In contrast, there seems to be a significant and positive role for infrastructure for manufacturing and agriculture. These two sectors are more capital intensive in nature, indicating\",\"Nonlinearity between infrastructure inequality and growth: Evidence from India\\nAbstractIndia is the 11th most unequal developed economy, and it is also an under-performing economy in terms of growth. The authors find that there are three sources of this underperformance. First is underinvestment in infrastructure. They show that the infrastructure investment gap, which is estimated as a ratio of infrastructure to GDP, explains about one-fourth of the growth gap between India and the average growth of advanced economies from 1960 to 2012. Second is an infrastructure quality gap which, they say, may explain as much as 25% of India's growth performance. Third, infrastructure is a significant impediment to the country'S potential for growth as measured by the output per capita.

However, in the aftermath of the project' completion, the road network was unable to meet the expectations of users and has failed to achieve the level of traffic it is capable of supporting. To address the issue, this paper uses a large-scale survey of over 1000 households on the GQL and a road-network travel cost model to assess the role of road infrastructure in household travel decisions. A number of factors are found to be important determinants of household' choice of travel mode, which are also found in a previous survey. The study highlights important differences in households' travel\",\"Productivity and technical efficiency in Indian states' manufacturing: the role of infrastructure, size and location\\nThis paper examines the technical, physical and social infrastructure and productivity levels in the manufacturing sector in 28 Indian States in three different industrial classifications: large, medium and small. A non-parametric approach of data envelopment analysis is used to derive the production frontiers and measure the productivity of manufacturing establishments. The data covers the period between 1997-98 and 2001-02. We also use panel regression analysis to examine the effect of these infrastructure indicators and size of the establishment on the level of production. Finally, we estimate the total factor productivity, its components and decompose it into its labour and physical components. Our findings show that there has been a marked improvement and convergence in all the States, as evidenced by the significant improvements in total and labour productivity. Productivity gains were also found to be higher in large and medium sized firms and in those located in urban areas.

The study uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies and uses statistical and spatial analysis for the analysis of the data collected. Results show that during peak hours at the time of tragedy the railway lines at station are over crowded and this leads to an increase in crowd density on both sides of platform. This in turn results in congestion on the platforms and overcrowding on train coaches.\",\"Globalisation and the changing face of port infrastructure: The Indian perspective\\nAbstract\\nThe paper examines the impact of economic liberalisation on port and port-related infrastructure in India, with specific reference to port capacity development and management, port governance and regulation, and private investment in infrastructure.

Port capacity constraints, lack of proper regulatory framework, absence of a unified system for tariff setting and determination, non-availability of modern equipment and technology, poor infrastructure and services, high logistics cost, etc., pose a challenge to the efficient functioning of the ports. Globalisation has also led to a shift in the ownership of ports from the government sector to private and institutional investors.

The transformation of the industrial sector from a labor-intensive one to a capital and technology intensive sector is underway. With this shift, the role of ICT has become important for the growth of industrial efficiency and productivity, and in reducing inefficiencies that arise from the fragmentation of physical infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a two-sector model and examine the effect of infrastructure and ICT on productivity in both the services and manufacturing sectors. Using the data of manufacturing and services sectors for years 1998-2000, for a panel of 30 industrial clusters and a control group of non-industrial clusters, our results show that the productivity growth in manufacturing is positively associated with the development of road and power infrastructure in the manufacturing clusters whereas, in case of services sector, both infrastructure development and use of technology increases the level of productivity. We find that ICT infrastructure\",\"Inter-state variations in rural healthcare infrastructure in North-East India\\nAuthor\\nSahu, Nivedita\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nRural India faces a wide range of health issues that are not adequately addressed. A large population of rural India is affected, with a disproportionate share of burden on women and children, and the poor. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the public healthcare system in the country is inadequate and uneven. In this thesis, I use the data of the NFHS-5 (National family Health Survey) to analyze the variations and trends across states & district in public health infrastructure. The analysis includes the availability and coverage of public hospitals, public primary healthcare centres \\u002f subcentres, dispensaries, health camps, community health centres, maternity homes, child health clinics, blood banks, eye clinics [with cataract removal facility], and health personnel.

Results suggest that distance does matter, but the effects are not uniform across all the states. While the distance from the home to the delivery site has a negative effect on institutional deliveries, the same does not hold for the quality of care at the facility or maternal and foetal health. In fact, it is the socio economic conditions of rural India that seem to be driving decisions to deliver at home or at public facilities.\\nDownload the publication here.\",\"The impact of social infrastructure and physical infrastructure on economic growth in Punjab, India\\nP.S.

However, they have not had the desired effect in Africa. To date, only a small number of P3 projects have been successful. This is despite several countries, such as Ethiopia and Ghana, developing a robust legal and administrative framework to facilitate P2s. Despite this progress, many governments in sub-Sahara Africa are still reluctant to develop their own PPs.\\nThis paper aims to provide a holistic view of PPPs by looking at PPS in the subSaharan region, from conception to implementation, with the aim of identifying the barriers to successful implementation. It provides a conceptual overview of the PPP framework, the role of private investors and financing institutions, and outlines the main legal, contractual, financial, operational, political and regulatory issues.

The experiment took place in rural India and was a randomized control (randomized by farm). The infrastructure provided was the installation of irrigation wells. We find that the irrigation infrastructure investment has a positive impact on productivity, which is statistically significant at a p-value of 5% with respect to the non-infrastructure group. This finding is robust to controlling for potential unobservable selection, heterogeneity, endogeneity, unmeasured confounding, reverse causality, omitted variable bias and a range of other econometric approaches.

It examines DFIs role in the infrastructure value chain from the perspective of infrastructure funding in Brazil and India.\\nThe paper argues that DFEs can play key role as catalysts of economic growth in developing countries through infrastructure financing. This can be done by providing financial guarantees or by directly funding the construction of projects. DFAs provide financial guarantee to private and public investors for financing infrastructure projects in a country where there is lack of institutional financing or a weak credit rating system. In addition, the paper shows that infrastructure investment can create employment and increase productivity. The paper also suggests ways of promoting infrastructure in Nigeria in order for the country to benefit from such projects as is the case with China and South Korea.

We employ the Bayesian spatial autoregressive model for the spatial transmission of coronavirus disease, as well as a time trend model to analyze the role of social structures and the government response in mitigating its impact.\\nWe find strong evidence that the size and density of urban population are significant predictors of infections and deaths in cities and towns in 2020. In terms of mortality, the effect of density on infection is twice that of population density. Moreover, our estimates reveal that cities with large populations and a low density, like Chandigarh, Delhi NCR, and Mumbai, had a higher infection and death rate compared to cities like Lucknow,\",\"Governance Issues in GIS Infrastructure in India\\nAbstract - GIS technology was introduced in the Indian scenario as a part of the Government Information Infrastructure (GII). This is a network of computers that can communicate with each other. It is used by the users to get information stored in any one of these computer systems. The Indian Government is in process of establishing a GIS-GIS based infrastructure for the entire nation. This infrastructure is being designed for data collection and storage of data in computer. GIS infrastructure can help in decision making, planning in different areas such as agriculture, health, education etc.\\nIn this paper, the authors present an overview of GIS related policy in our country. We have discussed issues related to GIS in infrastructure management. Finally we present our opinion on how GIS can be effectively and efficiently implemented in a large country like India.\",\"Impact of public transport and non-motorized transport infrastructure on travel mode shares, energy, emissions and safety: Case of Indian cities\\n- Source:\\n-, 2018, Vol. 2, Issue 9, pp. xv-xv\\nCustomer comments\\nNo comments were found for Impact of Public Transport and Non-Motorized Transport Infrastructure on Travel Mode Shares, Energy, Emissions and Safety: Cases of Three Indian Cities.

However, it is important for growth of the country's economy and to create jobs. The infrastructure projects undertaken by public sector enterprises in the past have been plagued by a number of challenges, mainly with respect to financing. In addition, the projects are often delayed due to land issues, lack of environmental clearances and disputes with locals. Further, due delays in infrastructure project delivery, many projects become unviable. As a result, there is an urgent need to review and improve the financing models for infrastructure.\\nKey challenges and issues\\nThere are a variety of issues associated with infrastructure financing in emerging economies.

The Government of India, since its Independence, had set up public sector companies for the development of this sector through various publicprivate partnerships. However, the performance of public private partnerships in this sub-sector was not satisfactory for various reasons, and hence, there was a need to explore private sector participation in WASH sector. In recent years, private participation has taken a different shape in water sector in terms of new models, which can be broadly categorized as PublicPrivate Partnership - Build & Operate and Public Private Partnership-Transfer. Both these models have different implications for government and private partners, but the success of PPP depends on a number of factors like availability of suitable project, availability\\u002fcost of finance, political will, regulatory and institutional issues in both government \",\"Analyzing the dynamic relationships between physical infrastructure, financial development and economic growth in India, we find a strong positive correlation between the two variables.

The data are taken from a household survey in 1998. A multinomial logistic regression model has been adopted for the analysis. It is found that the demand for and utilization of primary care has increased with age, female gender, urban residence and higher education. Demand for hospital services has also increased over the period of the survey but has declined over time. Provisioning has improved over a period and has reached the rural communities as well. Female gender and urban residency have had a positive effect on the use of modern health facilities. However, the level of education and rural or urban resident status have not had any influence on health services utilization.

It examines the PPP arrangements in 13 large-scale road projects across India from 2000 to 2010. The study found that there was no direct relationship with the governance arrangements and their influence on project success; rather, the success of PPP projects depended on the quality of the contracts, project design, and government commitment and oversight. In addition, it found a relationship that is not expected with governance structure and contract structure, namely, that PPP infrastructure contracts are generally more complex and more expensive than non-PPPs. As such, government intervention and control over PPP contracts and projects are required and are the key to success in PPP): 4 ()\\nPages: 549-566:4\",\"Infrastructure maintenance and rural economic activity: Evidence from India\\nAbstractThis paper provides a new measure of infrastructure development for the rural economy and examines its impact on the level and volatility of rural real GDP.

Despite its popularity, there is limited empirical evidence on the performance of PPPs in terms of their ability to deliver high-quality infrastructure and services and achieve development goals. A review of existing studies indicates that the PPP model has not always delivered the promised outcomes of highquality infrastructures, reduced costs, enhanced efficiency, and increased service availability. This study aims to identify the factors that may be constraining the ability of the public and private sectors to achieve these objectives through PPP in the context of India. The study examines the nature and causes of disputes in PPP agreements, their impact on PPP outcomes, the role of dispute settlement procedures in reducing the impact of these disputes and its effect on outcomes. Finally, this study identifies the main factors constrapping disputes resolution mechanisms in Indian public infrastructure projects\",\"The Scenario of FDI in Infrastructure of India\\nThe Infrastructure in India is not sufficient for the growth of the nation. Fearing this, the government has decided to attract the foreign investment. The main concern is to bring the FII in the infrastructure. But the scenario is that there is no such clear cut FID policy and the policy is very confusing for investors. It is important to have proper FIDA policy in place.\\nFDI \\u2013 The Scenarios in different Infrastructure\\nTelecom: The Telecom sector has opened for FIE. 100% FIDE has been allowed in Telecom.

This study investigates the impact on rural-urban inequality of two different types of infrastructures in rural India during the last two decades. Our main focus is on electricity, irrigation, roads and transport. In rural areas, we find a positive and significant relationship between the number of electrification projects and inequality. A negative and insignificant link with the rural\\u2013urban distribution of irrigation projects was found. On the contrary, road and rail projects were negatively related to inequality at the village level. The main explanation for this is that roads are more likely to benefit the better-connected rural households in more developed states, whereas railways benefit all rural residents, including those who live in less developed areas.\",\"All dressed up and nowhere to go: India Infrastructure Report 2018, launched by the PwC India and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on February 1, 2020, revealed that infrastructure investments could increase by $130 billion to 160 billion in 12 months, with a focus on road, rail, airports, ports and power.\\n\\u201cAs the country gears up for elections, a large chunk of investment in infrastructure is expected to take place in the next six months,\\u201d said Mr Pramod Bhasin, partner, PWC, who was addressing the media.

The study revealed that there is a wide variation in the availability of various facilities among different states in India. The availability in various states are: Primary health centre (PHC) is available in all states, 50% of the total states have sub-centre available, and 33% states has a dispensary available. Among tertiary health care facilities, hospitals are available at a rate of 80% in some states. In terms of doctors, the study shows a significant gap between the number needed and doctors available for a state. For all the states combined it shows that the required doctors are 8.7 times as much as that currently available - 1.3 lakhs in 2011 as compared to 16,100 in actual available number of physicians [2010-11].

The model takes account of technological progress, population, and environmental degradation. These variables are related to the production functions, the demand for infrastructure and their prices. In a national system, it is assumed that a country is a homogeneous unit and the infrastructure supply is determined by the prices prevailing in the economy and technological change. A regional system takes into account the regional nature, i.e., the spatial nature of infrastructure requirements and its demand. It is shown theoretically, as well as empirically that the model is capable of capturing the dynamic interaction of factors affecting infrastructure demand and supply and hence provides a useful model for the analysis of long term infrastructure planning. Further, a simulation analysis is carried out to study the interaction between infrastructure, technological advance and population\",\"The New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: China's Ambiguous Approach to Global Financial Governance\\nIn 2014, Beijing initiated a new financial institution, the NDB (New Development) Bank, in order to promote its own development goals.

We use the Census of Manufacturing Industries in India to study the determinants of location and capital structure, as well as the effects of regional differences in infrastructure quality on industrial location. The results confirm that there is a relationship of causation between infrastructure investment and industrial growth. However, there does not seem to be any direct relationship in terms of a positive impact on manufacturing employment. Furthermore, it seems to imply that the quality of roads is the most significant determinant of industrial development. Finally, we also show that infrastructure has a strong impact in reducing the level of environmental pollution generated. This implies that investment in roads may be a more efficient way of improving the environment rather than investment to improve the efficiency of production: 111\",\"Quality infrastructure of national metrology institutes: a comparative study of India and China\\n- Authors: Li, Zhiyong, Chen, Yujie\\n-: 10.1088\\u002f0957-0233\\u002f18\\u002f8A\\u002f085007\\nAbstract: The Chinese National Metrology Institute (NCMI) has been working as the national measurement standards institute since its establishment 20 years ago.

It examines the extent to which infrastructure investment is an important determinant of growth at state level. The analysis shows that states which invest more in physical infrastructures are likely to see higher rates of economic growth, but that the impact of infrastructure on economic development is not uniform across states, with some states being more responsive than others to infrastructure-induced growth. Further, the analysis reveals that infrastructure investments are more likely in states whose growth rates have been higher, indicating a \\\"catalytic\\\" effect. In the absence of a strong catalytic effect, investments in infrastructure are not sufficient to induce growth and that a higher level of investment would be required.

To accomplish this purpose, this study uses data on regional disparities in per capita income for the period 1974-74 to 2011-12 at the state level for 25 Indian - states. Based on this data, the empirical findings of this paper demonstrate that, on the average, a 20 percent increase in public investment in infrastructure \\u2013 per unit of GDP -- at state-level in one year raises the per capital incomes of states by 1.2-0.9 percentage points in the following years. This result is robust to several sensitivity tests. In fact, in a regression analysis where the level of per capita income in 1980 is used as a control variable, public capital investments are shown to increase per-capita regional income by almost four times over the long-term period. These results suggest\",\"Constellation design of remote sensing small satellite for infrastructure monitoring in india\\nAbstract\\nThe infrastructure system in India, is a major contributor of GDP and is also a critical factor for the overall development of the country. The development and maintenance of an efficient infrastructure is of utmost importance and it has been a subject matter of research for quite long. A lot of technologies and tools have been developed to help the infrastructure managers in this regard. Remote sensing satellite technology provides a cost effective way to monitor the condition of infrastructure and also helps in the identification of possible threats in an early stage. In order to meet the ever growing demands of this field, the remote sensor systems need to evolve continuously. India's own remote satellite is the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS). IRS has a long history and in recent times has also been playing a significant role in monitoring the national infrastructure. This thesis deals with the design and development on an advanced remote observation system based on the IRS. It is intended to be an all round monitoring system for national level infrastructure in a\",\"Association between child immunization and availability of health infrastructure in slums in India\\n- Authors\\nAbstract\\nBackground: Slums of India are the most unplanned areas of the country. It is difficult in such areas to get immunization for children under the universal immunization programme. A study of immunizing facilities and immunization status of children of slum dwellers of Kolkata has been undertaken to determine the availability and accessibility of such facilities. Materials and methods: The study population included 3000 mothers (50% males and 50 % females) of age 0-5 years from 12 slams of 6 wards of North, South and Central Kolkata. All the mothers of these children were interviewed to collect data. Immunization status was also ascertained through the immunisation cards of all the children. Results: Out of a total population of approximately one lakh slummers, only 25% of them had access to health facilities available under universal immunizations programme, 10-25 %. The immunization coverage was low.

It is also evident that transport infrastructure is the foundation stone of the nation's economic development. This study seeks to understand how infrastructure and development in the transport sector can co-exist. The study focuses on one of India' s major corridors \\u2014 the Mumbai-Chennai-Bangalore National Highway 4 (NH4). The corridor has witnessed unprecedented growth over the last decade. However, its development has not been planned in a coherent manner. While the NH4 corridor is seen by some as the engine of growth for the country' 'it has also been responsible for creating large-scale congestion that impedes economic activity. In this study, the authors attempt to answer the question: can spatial planning of infrastructure provide a solution to the congestion problem in such corridors? In order to achieve\",\" initiatives.

However, few studies explore the impact of public infrastructure on private school choice and school quality. Using a unique dataset with a detailed geographic information system for the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, this study estimates the effect of infrastructure development around private and public schools on the probability of students achieving the minimum level of primary schooling. In addition, it investigates how the infrastructure around schools may influence the quality of the private education offered. This paper shows that students living in low-infrastructure areas are 2.1 times more likely to drop out of school. Moreover, the presence of higher education infrastructure is negatively related to enrolment in private primary schools. The proximity to public primary, secondary and tertiary education facilities also influences schooling outcomes, especially in terms of dropout rates in public and private private schooling and enrolments in primary education.\\nKeywords\",\"Funding urban infrastructure: from government to markets to philanthropy\\nAbstract\\nThe financing of infrastructure is one of the main challenges facing governments, businesses and civil society. The traditional public funding model for infrastructure projects is being questioned by the global recession. A number of countries have started to use innovative financing methods such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), tolling and congestion charging, or user fees \\u2013 such methods could be used to help finance infrastructure more cost effectively and reduce the fiscal pressure on public finances. At the same time, new financial products, such those developed by international financial institutions, are being used by governments to finance projects. These new tools are often based on market instruments and private participation.

A survey of rural roads, bridges, irrigation and power projects was made in 1961; 70% of all rural households had access to irrigation, 30% were connected to electricity, while only 7.7% had road access. The rural development expenditure for this sample was calculated for the years 1956-1963. These results are analyzed in connection with income data collected for 1942-1951. An attempt to explain the relationship between the growth of agricultural exports in this region and infrastructure expenditure is made. Finally, some of these findings are applied to\",\"effect of water borne diseases on indian economy: a cost-benefit analysis\\nThe study of health-economy nexus has become more prominent in the last decade. The objective of the present paper is to estimate the health loss in terms of present value (in crores of rupees) due to waterborne diseases, which are caused by the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. A model is used to analyse the effects of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis, jaundice, malaria, dengue, encephalitis, typhoid, and tuberculosis. In the model the total health expenditure of a country is divided into two components namely the direct costs incurred on the treatment of patients and loss of productivity of healthy people. Direct health expenditures on treatment are estimated based on data from WHO and the World Bank, whereas the loss due of lost productivity is estimated using data on productivity loss from the National Commission on Population.\\nWe find that choleramainsl cause an expenditure\",\"The ecological impact of transportation infrastructure has long been a concern with planners and policy makers alike. While a growing number of studies document the environmental impacts of infrastructure on land and ecosystems, little is known about the ecological effects of highway transportation on marine ecosystems. This study investigated the impacts on benthic macrofaunal communities of a marine embankment built along State Road A-1-A (SR 1) in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The study included two sections of SR - 10 miles each, with one section built over the 1992-1993 period and the control section not built until 2001. Both sections were sampled during low tide in the summer of 2012.

The study sought to examine different factors that have contributed to poor development of human habitation in urban and rural areas. This has been done through an analysis of factors such as lack of access to land, inadequate infrastructure, high cost of land and housing, and poor access for water, drainage and waste facilities. It has also sought answers to questions such, as why some settlements have developed at faster rates than others, why there is still a large disparity in the provision of services across regions and urban areas and why infrastructure provision has remained a constant issue in rural and small urban settlements despite government interventions over the years. To address these questions, the research has employed a mix\",\"Which infrastructure matters more for growth: Economic or social?

In the context of British rule, public infrastructure was a key element of political power, and the building of colonial infrastructure became a major instrument of imperial policy. However, little has been written about public architecture and infrastructure from a historiographical perspective. The present chapter will therefore examine, from an analytical perspective, both the nature of public buildings in Colonial India and their role as symbols of power and colonial rule. It will be argued that, although the buildings were often impressive in terms of architectural design, they were, in reality, an inadequate symbol of a modernised state and a civil society. They represented the colonial power's control over the local population rather than its political and\",\"Infrastructuring work: Building a state-wide hospital information infrastructure in India\\nAbstract\\nIn 2007, an Indian state government embarked on an ambitious plan to build a hospital data information system, which was to include patient records and diagnostic and therapeutic information for use across all health care settings in the state. This infrastructure would also include an electronic health record that would track each patient as he\\u002fshe travels across multiple facilities. In this paper, I describe the development of this infrastructure through the lens of the Infrastrucuring concept (Crawford and Dourish, 2011), drawing on the results obtained through a 5 month ethnographic field study in this hospital and through in-depth interviews with informants. My goal is to understand the social, economic and cultural forces that drive health system reform and the ways in which the infrastructure that is created by these reforms affects and is affected by them. I find the process of building this health infrastructure to be both complex and multi-dimensional.\",\"Exploring citizen infrastructure and environmental priorities in Mumbai, India\\nAbstract\\nThis paper presents the findings of the research project Exploring citizen priorities for Mumbai\\u2019s infrastructure in the 21st century, which explored citizen views on infrastructure provisioning in 2013 and how this may change over the next 20 years to 2050 (in terms of their priorities, concerns and aspirations).

The data are based on annual reports of railway companies, government surveys, official censuses, local gazetteers, land ownership registers, censorial records, court documents, railway timetables, passenger and freight tariffs and receipts, maps, correspondence, photographs, newspaper advertisements, architectural drawings, engineering drawings and reports, etc. Using panel data regressions of 1870-1945 and spatial econometrics for 1910, this paper finds strong positive associations between investment in transport infrastructure and GDP per capita growth across regions of all scales. This relationship is strongest in areas where the population was least mobile, where transport costs, especially in terms of time, were highest. It is not clear whether or not these associations are spurious. If they are not, transport may have been the key to British economic success\",\"India's CBDC for digital public infrastructure payments\\nThis is an exclusive article that appeared in the 4th edition of the World Blockchain Forum magazine published on 25 April.\\nThe Reserve Bank of India has announced its intention to issue its CBDCs for payments in digital Public Infrastructure and Digital Public Services.

In particular, it is believed that a better and more responsive governance structure and stronger accountability are the main preconditions for successful tax mobilizations. The empirical tests show that in general, higher tax revenues are achieved by better quality political environment. On the other hand, ICT infrastructures seem to play a very important role in tax administration and collection systems of various countries. A significant and positive relationship between these variables is revealed by the study. Thus, we conclude from our empirical findings that ICT can play the crucial role by increasing the collection of revenues. We believe that our results can help the Indian Government for the effective and efficient collection and utilisation of public taxes.

Inadequate cold-chain storage conditions are associated with vaccine failure and the loss of efficacy of the vaccine. The vial monitor (VM) is an indicator of whether a vaccine is in cold conditions and is considered an objective indicator.\\nMethods\\nA cross-sectional study was conducted between June\\u2013August 2014 in the tribal district, Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh, India. A total of 50 health facilities were selected, using multi-stage sampling, to study the relationship between VM and other variables such as the type of refrigerator, temperature of refrigerators, and presence\\u002fabsence of power failure at the facility. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, t-test and binary logistic regression. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Using annual data from 1971 to 2008, the analysis indicates that the impact of the investment in infrastructure is not very different from investment spending in other sectors. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that a 1 percent increase in the ratio between the capital and the GDP is associated with a decline in real GDP of 0.7 percent. However, it may also be argued that an increase of capital spending of one unit increases GDP by about two units for every unit spent as an input in capital-intensive manufacturing industries. These results suggest the existence of a negative capital income): 9 (2009)\\nIssue )\",\"Economic growth in India: the role of physical and social infrastructure\\nIndia has made impressive progress over the last two decades, but it continues to lag behind most high-growth emerging economies (e.g., China and Korea) in per capita income.

There is a growing recognition of the need for better infrastructure in Indian cities. Inadequate infrastructure is often blamed for low quality of life, environmental damage and social disparities. However, it remains unclear which types of infrastructure are associated with better quality or value of land and housing in particular, and what factors can explain these relations. This paper examines the effect of different types and levels of accessibility and infrastructure on residential value in Rajokat. Accessibility measures used were travel time to key locations and the distance to railway stations. A total of 1000 residential properties were selected as the data was available for both accessibility measures. For analysis, data were collected using Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR).

The study is based on the theoretical arguments on which the European Union\\u2019s Structural Funds are based. It uses a set of econometric models to test the effect of capital accumulation on GDP growth. Empirical evidence for this purpose is extracted from 18 European countries for the period 1970-1997, with the aim of investigating the relationship between growth and investment. An empirical investigation of this relationship is carried out by means of a system of panel cointegration and vector error correlation models with structural breaks. This is a challenging task because the empirical literature on structural change has been largely neglected. Results reveal the existence of an inverse relationship in all countries studied between total infrastructure capital stock and GDP. These empirical results are robust, even after controlling for various macro-economic variables, and can be explained by a combination of two mechanisms: direct and indirect ones.

This study analyzes the investment decisions and the capacity development of India's airport operators in post privatization era in order to ascertain the impact of privatizing and regulating the Indian air cargo industry. The study also examines the effects of macroeconomic factors on the airport investment in India over the period of 1995 -2010. Using co-integration and error correction modeling approaches, the study examines various determinants of airport capacity and investment by airport operator and identifies the factors responsible for the growth in airport investments in this period. Further, we also identify the sources and magnitude of the macro factors that affect the airline industry and in turn affect airport capacities and investments. We find that the privatized airports are more likely to invest in their infrastructure and increase capacity in response to economic growth. However\",\"Infrastructure inequality is a characteristic of urbanization. The most important indicators of the degree of inequality and its impact on the development of society are the level of development and the structure of infrastructure. In this study, the authors analyze the situation with the implementation of regional policy of Ukraine for the period of 2014-2020 on infrastructure development in the country and identify a few priority areas for increasing the effectiveness of public investment in this sphere.\\nThe aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of investments in transport infrastructure and regional roads on regional development using a dynamic panel data model. We find that investments into regional transport have a significant impact, while investments from the state budget have only a weak effect. Investments into the construction of roads have the highest effect on both the growth of per capita GDP and employment. This suggests that road investments have an important multiplier effect, but this effect is smaller than the effect of railway investments.\",\"Effect of bicycle friendly roadway infrastructure on bicycling activities in urban India.

The data for this paper was collected from a sample of 50 cities from across 22 States and 6 Union Territories using a multi-stage sampling technique. Using these data, two indices for housing accessibility and infrastructure have been built at the city level. These indices provide a measure of the extent of access that people living in urban areas have to essential infrastructure as well as their living conditions and quality. In the present research, we employ the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression to find that housing is more accessible in large cities compared to smaller cities. This is particularly evident for people with lower socio- economic groups.

This paper investigates the role that games might have in strengthening institutional frameworks in this context, by designing experimental games to assess the impact of a range of institutional measures. We test the effects of different types of water governance on the performance of common infrastructures by conducting an experiment in 10 rural water and sanitation schemes. The experimental design allows us to estimate the effect of governance types on a variety of measures such as water availability, cost, quality and quantity of service. Our results suggest that, when water is managed by a self-help group, water supply and service quality are better, while cost and water quantity are worse. When water management is through a panchayat, service quantity, supply costs and quality of services\",\"India evolving: Infrastructure since 1991\\nInfrastructure development in India is one of the fastest-growing sectors that contributes to the economy of India to a great extent. Since Independence, India has been witnessing a massive shift in the way the country has developed infrastructure. The government has taken initiatives for the growth of different sectors.\\nFrom roads to airports, there has seen a lot of improvement in infrastructure in recent years. However, the government can only do its best, and the rest of it is left on individuals to take care of. Infrastructure plays a very significant role in a country and is responsible for a smooth and easy way for people to commute. There has to be a proper flow of traffic, so the infrastructure of a particular city or country needs to support the movement of people. It would help if you considered the importance of infrastructure as well as the challenges India faces in this sector. Read on to know more about the current situation of this industry.

Yet, to date, research has largely failed to address the issue of power inequalities, which can be seen as the key driver behind the rapid development and expansion of renewable energy systems. In India, the state government has been implementing renewable projects across the country to meet the growing demand for electricity. Kerala is at the forefront of this development in the south, having installed more than 3,800 MW of grid solar in just over ten years. The expansion has led to a surge of new projects and a proliferation of land acquisition in order to access sufficient land for development. But the local communities are often not consulted and their views disregarded in planning. This paper investigates the social, environmental and economic impacts on communities in two different districts. It highlights how power inequality is reproduced as land rights are not protected; how communities\",\"Regional distribution of infrastructure and basic amenities in urban India: Issues concerning empowerment of local bodies.\\nAbstract\\nThe paper explores the distribution and accessibility of infrastructural and service-based amenities across the urban districts of India using a unique database of 2,200 urban local self governments. We find that the share of urban areas served by the government with the basic and infrastructure services increases with an increasing urban size. The urban population living more than one kilometer away from public transport, public health, education, and water supply facilities is significantly higher in the larger cities. Further, we find an increase, rather than decrease, in inequality in service delivery across districts. Our results provide empirical support for the argument that local governments should be allowed to expand and provide more services to the population of their jurisdiction in a more decentralized and devolved environment, thereby reducing inequality.\",\"How do different categories of infrastructure affect development?

A sample of 1,000 schools is covered from five states. Data is collected by means of a specially designed school questionnaire and by using an asset index for each school. This paper assess the impact of public school expansion on access to education for poor children in the five selected States. The study finds that private aided schools have much better physical facilities, including more teachers and more textbooks. They also charge higher tuition fees and the quality of education appears to be higher. It is also found that the cost structure of private schools makes them vulnerable to fluctuations in their financial inflows. Finally, it is argued here that, despite the higher quality and lower costs of the private sector\",\"India Infrastructure Report 2002-Governance Issues for Commercialisation of Infrastructure\\n- ID: 1770\\nThe Indian market is poised for massive private sector investments in the coming years.

In a series of meetings and consultations with the private and public sector, the Council is expected to come up with policy recommendations by the end of 1999.\\nIndia's infrastructure sector will undergo a radical change with an influx of private funds in coming months. However, it faces a major hurdle in that it has not yet created a legal framework in which private entities can participate in this market. A key challenge is that the Indian infrastructure industry is not ready for private participation and private investors are not clear in their mind the exact role they would like to play in an infrastructure project.

The consulting industry is one of most profitable sectors in India. However, in such competitive industry, knowledge has always been a crucial factor. This is why, there is a great need to understand how the organization structure affect the knowledge of employees. There is also much research on the organizational structures; however, it is limited in its application to other sectors. Therefore, with a view to explore the role of organizational design on knowledge management in this sector, a case study has been conducted on Infrastructure consulting companies.

Using a unique panel data set of 1,000 Indian states, over the period 1993 to 2010, I investigate the effect of various types of infrastructure and their combination with the level of poverty on household consumption and expenditure. I find that infrastructurally developed states have lower poverty rates than the infrastructually underdeveloped states. This suggests that poverty can be reduced by developing infrastructure. Infrastructure, particularly roads, has a significant positive effect on income generation and hence has an impact on the poverty level. The results also indicate that the impact of road infrastructure is stronger than that of irrigation infrastructure in reducing poverty. However, the results show that irrigation and power infrastructures do not have any significant impact. In addition, while there are significant gender differences in the effects,\",\"Rural infrastructure and growth: an overview of the impact of public investments in rural infrastructure\\nThis paper presents an introduction to the literature on public expenditures in the rural sector and their impact on economic growth.

The NWMP was later renamed the National Urban Waste Water Management Mission in April 2006. However, even the NWMM has not yet been completely successful in treating all wastewater. As a result, a lot of untreated wastewater ends up being released into the river systems of the country. Some of this water also ends in the sea, polluting it. This is one of several factors that has led to the increasing incidence of water-borne diseases. According to a government report, waterborne illnesses kill 2.7 million Indians every year.

The financial health assessment of the projects can be conducted by using a number of methods, some of them are: traditional debt to equity ratio, debt coverage ratio, interest coverage, return on equity, and profitability ratio etc. However, all these methods have their own shortcomings. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive model is developed based on the stochastic simulation technique to assess the financial risks of a highway project. An example model of an investment based highway PPP project is used to analyse the effectiveness of this model by simulating the project for a period of fifteen years. Simulation results suggest that the developed model can help to predict and understand the various parameters that affect the overall performance of financial aspects of any highway based\",\"The roads (not) taken: the materiality, poetics and politics of infrastructure in Manipur, India\\nDate2013-11\\nAuthor\\nLal, Anuja\\nMetadataShow full item record\\nAbstract\\nThis project seeks to examine the impact and implications of the construction and maintenance of a major road infrastructure \\u2013 the NH- 200 - in India through the life of one village in northern Manpur.
