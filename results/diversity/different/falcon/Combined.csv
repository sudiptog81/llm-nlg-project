The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been a vocal advocate for action on climate change, particularly at the COP meetings and through the G7 and G20 forums.
However, the government’s approach to climate action has faced significant pushback from within, especially from the country’
s most populous state – Uttar Pradesh (UP), which is also the site of its largest coal-fired power plant. In 2017, UP’ s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, took over and has since pursued a number of anti-environment initiatives, including an order to stop all tree-felling in the state. He’ also pushed for a controversial new state-level forest policy that allows for increased felling to be carried out by local villagers, and he launched the UP Solar Mission.

Indian climate,Water resources and climate change: An Indian perspective,"Water resources and climate change: An Indian perspective
The Indian monsoon is one of the largest and most influential climate systems affecting the global climate. The Indian summer monsoons, which are driven primarily by the tropical Pacific Ocean, play a significant role in regional climate and weather systems and also affect large areas of other continents through moisture transport and the associated atmospheric teleconnections. However, the mon So, it is critical that climate scientists, hydrologists and policy-makers work together to better understand and manage the potential impacts of future climate variability and change on Indian water resources systems.
This paper will first present the state of knowledge on climate impacts on water supply for the Indian region and then present key climate scenarios and their potential implications for India’s water availability and demand. Finally, this paper discusses the challenges of water demand and supply under future changes in climate in the face of increasing populations and rapid urbanization.",2,180,0.56,7.408103670980854,0.8877362008454198,0.05004988623368693,0.8628571428571429,0.8736423841059604,0.7744668121216637,63.68655454644205,57.674285714285716,62.71826470588235

Abstract. The Indian subcontinent experiences extreme variability in temperature, precipitation, and wind fields. It is also the centre of origin of several climatic regimes of global significance. This variability is largely influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the South-Asian monsoon – the two major climate systems. However, the nature and intensity of these climatic systems are still not well understood in the context of IOD and monsoons. In the present study, we use the fractal properties of the IDFI and MDFD datasets, to quantify the dynamical complexity of climate. We find that the MDR has an intermediate range of spatial scale, while the IDDR is at a fine-scale. Furthermore, MDA has the highest range in its time scale.
Based on the time-space properties, it is evident that MDP and MPD are at the intermediate and fine ranges",3,198,0.5580110497237569,7.50727087709638,0.8877797734776209,0.049706024485297436,0.8514285714285714,0.8545222929936307,0.771325800564466,57.6107099879663,54.86740331491713,51.23661971830986

Abstract :
In India, the glass and glass products industry is a rapidly growing segment with an expected annual growth rate of more than 15% in the next few years. The glass industry in India has come up with some new technologies in manufacturing glass, such as insulating glass to reduce heat transfer, low iron and low E glass for solar control etc.
With a wide spectrum of glass options available, it is essential to select appropriate glass in order to achieve the desired performance for the application. In order for a particular glass option to perform optimally, its energy efficiency, thermal performance should be taken into consideration. Thermal performance of a building is one of the essential factors for achieving energy saving and sustainable building, and hence energy ratings is given by the government of India. This study aims to review the various energy rating systems for different kinds of glazing, glass types, thicknesses and spacings.

The Indian Ocean has a strong influence on global climate through a large-scale heat exchange with the atmosphere. Its circulation is driven by the monsoons, which are the dominant mode of tropical ocean-atmosphere interaction. The monsoon circulation can be strongly modulated by external forcing, for example in response to changes in the atmospheric circulation due to greenhouse warming. In a recent study we have shown that the circulation in model simulations of the twentieth century is modelled realistically, but that there are large deviations from a realistic circulation that occur on multiyear to centennial time scale, and can only be explained by a non-",6,194,0.6107784431137725,7.892996971848196,0.9036690904282911,0.04333927013280893,0.8666666666666667,0.8744055944055945,0.8258942432041301,71.52008608321377,77.73053892215569,62.630795574288726

The passive solar water distillation system, which has been designed by Dr. P.R.K. Prasad and his team, was used for distilling water under the different climatic condition of Rajasthan. The solar energy was utilized for the heat transfer through two types of solar collectors which are the parabolic solar dish collector of 3.5 m diameter and 0.7 m focal length and the flat plate collectors of area 7.4 m2 each.
Passive solar collector was installed in Rajasthan to test its performance under different weather conditions in a typical climate. In India, the temperature varies from 35°C to 45 °C. This temperature variation was studied with and without heat-storage system in which the water in the storage tank is pre-heated before storing it in it.

Indian climate,Changing climate discourse and politics in India. Climate change as challenge and opportunity for diplomacy and development,"Changing climate discourse and politics in India. Climate change as challenge and opportunity for diplomacy and development cooperation
This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of how climate change has become a key foreign policy and security priority for India in recent years, and of the opportunities and challenges this has posed for Indian diplomacy. We argue that while India’s response to climate has been driven in large measure by domestic considerations, the Indian Government’
s new position has opened up opportunities to promote international cooperation for tackling climate and related development goals and to build on new global momentum for addressing climate. But in doing so, a critical issue that must be considered is whether the country is prepared to assume the role of an effective leader for this new initiative. While there are important reasons for being optimistic about India's emerging diplomatic agenda on climate, there is also the concern that this agenda is still under development.
The Indian government has a long track record of engagement in the field of climate politics, beginning with the signing of The United Nations Framework",13,186,0.5495049504950495,7.80993274650624,0.8872066123601872,0.04892676627723248,0.9049999999999999,0.9058426966292125,0.8047405989342881,75.64212062594413,73.46534653465346,81.51120136589404

Abstract:
The impacts of climate change on agriculture in India are likely to be significant in the coming decades. The impacts will be felt both at the sector-level and at a farm- and household- level. They are expected to have significant implications for the production of food and agricultural goods, and will affect rural livelihoods. This study, commissioned by the Government of India’s National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) is designed to assess the impacts – both direct and indirect - of various climate scenarios on crop production in six Indian agroclimatic regions. It also assesses the extent to which adaptation actions in agriculture may reduce such impacts.

Abstract
The paper focuses on the political significance of the policy stories of Indian political actors in climate policy. I use a'storyline approach' and a discourse-analytical method to analyze how (1) the climate change discourse is articulated by Indian policy actors, 2) how these storyline-articulation processes are influenced by the 4-D ('dominant discourse') of climate and development, and 3) what the consequences of these story-lines can be for the opening up of new ‘political spaces’ within climate discourse and policy in India. Using a comparative analysis of interviews conducted with 18 policy-actors in the Indian context, the empirical analysis shows that climate – and especially climate-related development - policy is highly contested in terms of storyline articulation, which in turn has",15,184,0.5141242937853108,6.839978854825743,0.8714700577786099,0.057175921148478456,0.8742857142857143,0.8653594771241828,0.7734417020632358,55.716318443804035,51.152542372881356,50.658135775862064

Abstract
The performance of an Air Conditioning system is directly related to the efficiency of evaporator, condenser and the compressor. The heat rejection of the air-conditioner is done by a fan that drives the indoor air flow rate. It is observed that the heat load of any air conditioner system increases when the ambient temperature of a zone increases. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the theoretical energy efficiency for air cooler using evaporating and condensing heat pipes. This system has the ability to reject heat to any external zone and to absorb heat from any internal zone. A theoretical analysis for the performance and energy savings of heat-pipe based system in a single zone has been presented. In the proposed system, heat transfer is achieved by passing the evaporant (hot plate) to a condensor - which is the cool side of condencer. Heat from the hot side – condenc",20,184,0.4708994708994709,6.4737974103344404,0.8563244957904681,0.0631135141148179,0.8685714285714285,0.8509090909090907,0.7451217132138139,50.24883900928793,51.31216931216931,46.36659959758551

In present study, the genetic optimization algorithm – GA is applied on retrofits and building systems to maximize energy savings. GA based optimization method was applied for different retrofitting measures and combinations on a building with 10% heat gain reduction. It is found that 15.1% increase in energy reduction is achieved by integrating all the possible retrofit measures. This method can be used for other building types also, but in this study the method has been applied only on multi retrofitted building and the building in focus is an institutional building.",21,200,0.49714285714285716,6.576581830360554,0.8646840626509028,0.06032708068788636,0.9028571428571429,0.8850331125827814,0.7764800557193611,55.531183739124074,57.42857142857143,57.021437881594295

Abstract
Photovoltaic module degradation is a crucial concern for solar PV plant owners and manufacturers. The primary concern is that the degradation may be caused due to external factors such as weathering, UV radiation and mechanical damage. This study aims to determine if the multi crystalline silicon solar modules degrade due the external environment of western Himalayas by measuring their degradation over the first four years of operation. A laboratory set up was used to expose solar panels to different levels of heat, humidity and light. These factors are considered to be the main contributors to degradation under field condition. Solar PV modules were tested by monitoring and recording power output of the panel under varying temperature and humidity. After 4 years, the test",22,186,0.5721925133689839,7.824614938160297,0.8932769660729453,0.04697644132407527,0.8685714285714285,0.8652760736196308,0.816117615044371,53.067889224279014,65.475935828877,62.2967032967033

Cowpeas [ Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] grown during summer and winter seasons at two locations in North-west Himalayas were evaluated for physicochemical, functional and sensory properties. Cowpeaseeds were harvested from the plots at 50% seed development and 100% pod maturity stages for each season, dried at ambient temperature and ground in to 0.25mm size fraction using a hammer mill. Seed samples were analyzed for proximate composition, mineral content, protein, free amino acid and fat content and the results revealed that the seed protein content was high in both seasons. The seed fat and ash content were found high during the winter season. In general, the moisture content of both cow peaseed varieties was found very low.

We use panel data for the period of 1962 to 2010. The results indicate that climate-driven changes in temperature and rainfall have a negative impact, on average, while the impact of climate on food production is mixed. Climate change has not had a significant impact... on inflation. A significant reduction in food inflation and an increase in the real value of agricultural prices are found as the main impacts on the Indian economy from climate changes.

Indian climate,The impact of climate change on Indian agriculture,"The impact of climate change on Indian agriculture
The Indian agricultural sector contributes to a significant portion of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), and also provides livelihood to over half of India’ s population.
It has been estimated that the average growth rate of agriculture in India is around 3% per annum. However, agriculture is extremely weather sensitive. The agricultural growth in the last three decades has largely been driven by increased input use and improved technology. This trend may, however, not continue in future as the Indian cropland is already approaching its optimum carrying capacity for arable lands – estimated at 160 million hectares in 2004. As a result, agricultural productivity is expected to remain flat or decline in coming decades. Climate change will only aggravate the situation further as extreme events, such as droughts or heavy floods, will become more frequent. In fact, recent studies have shown that 70% of Indian districts have been affected, to some extent, by floods in last two decades, and",32,198,0.6237113402061856,8.687293719274631,0.9103871821881921,0.03916983567214144,0.9257142857142856,0.9265882352941158,0.8378472231471805,97.02937613567535,99.8917525773196,111.76453634085213

Abstract. Roof area constitutes a major proportion in the built environment and the roof plays a vital role in protecting the building and also in regulating the internal thermal comfort of the buildings, thus affecting the indoor climate. In the present study, the effect of using cool roofs to reduce the heat transfer into and from the structure, was investigated using a calibrated simulation tool developed based on a simplified energy model. The study was carried out using the calibrated cooling simulation model and validated it with the actual data of a typical building of India. Results obtained from this validated model were found to be in excellent agreement with field data. This model can be used for assessing the energy efficiency of buildings with different climatic conditions and can serve as an important tool for decision making of selecting the suitable materials for the roofs in different parts",33,187,0.5276381909547738,7.443252652587526,0.8792163882985435,0.0525408139132116,0.857142857142857,0.839085714285713,0.7794998619041953,53.745466321243526,52.17085427135678,45.33103448275862

In the past few decades, the Indian subcontinent has witnessed a significant increase in mean annual temperatures and precipitation, with the latter being the major driving force behind the changes. The impact of these climate changes is evident from an increase of about 5% in the mean crop productivity of wheat, rice, and sorghum, 7.9% for sugarcane, but a decline of 1.3% and 12% respectively for cotton and jute, between the years 1986–87 and the year 2001–02 (BISP 2012).

Abstract
The main purpose of this research work is the design of radiant cooled and/or evaporatively cooled buildings for various climatic conditions. For this purpose, the performance of a radiant and evaporated cooled building has been studied in four different climatic regions of India. The climatic data of these locations has used to predict the thermal performance for four typical building envelope and climate conditions for the purpose. A two dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has applied for each of the building types. In addition to this, a three dimensional 3D CFD model has developed for an office building in a hot and humid region and an experimental study has also been carried out in an evaporating cooled office room for verification of simulation model results. It is observed that the radiant system has better",42,184,0.5355191256830601,7.244368455354814,0.8801189491922892,0.05298724527211533,0.88,0.8784905660377356,0.7974651938169159,62.794117647058826,60.91803278688525,55.36416666666666
Indian climate,Climate change and Indian forests,"Climate change and Indian forests
The forests of India play a key role in combating climate change by capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, storing carbon and releasing oxygen.
India’s forests absorb approximately one-fourth of the country’ s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) per year. Forests in India sequester 2.2 billion tonnes carbon per annum – an amount of carbon 50 times greater than anthropogenic emissions into the Indian atmosphere per day. In the past decade alone, Indian rainforests have sequestered over 200 Mt of greenhouse gases. This is an area of about the size of Belgium. The carbon stored in the forest is equivalent in weight and mass to that present in 5.6 lakh cars, and 8 per cent of total global greenhouse emissions from all man-made sources. Indian forestry and agriculture can therefore be considered the largest carbon sinks on Earth. A large majority of these sinks are found in tropical forests, but India’",43,192,0.5875706214689266,7.81711869122942,0.8972674940050391,0.04570005681661267,0.897142857142857,0.9121568627450977,0.8106880494407276,84.69845360824742,70.45197740112994,75.63235871271586

Abstract
Climate change is considered by most governments to be one of the most pressing issues facing the world. Climate change policy involves a number of complex issues, with the interaction and coordination of international and national governments as well as state governments, and with a range of other sectors and stakeholders. This paper examines the climate policy process in Australia and the USA (which have similar policy frameworks for climate change) and India - a developing country and one that is not party to the Paris Agreement. The research is exploratory in nature, using a qualitative method based on the analysis of documents and semi structured interviews. It examines how the processes involved in the development and implementation of climate policies in these contexts are different.

Abstract. Indian rainfall is a highly complex hydrological phenomenon, influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. The Indian summer monsoons are highly variable, and the variability is influenced primarily by large scale atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections over the tropics. These are the primary drivers of the Indian Monsoon. A number of climate model simulations have been made to study the influence of external forcing such as greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol radiative forcing on the hydrology of India. In this paper, we compare observed data and simulated rainfall over 1951–1996 for the 16 CM1 climate simulations from the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). We have also performed statistical tests for these simulations. We find that, except for some of these CM simulations, all CM IP5 simulations do not reproduce",45,190,0.6091954022988506,8.035839261936376,0.9039327597093368,0.042876647484673444,0.8866666666666666,0.8653333333333318,0.8196100963085479,65.77035292822718,74.05747126436782,64.31788048552754
Indian climate,Impact of climate change in Indian horticulture-a review,"Impact of climate change in Indian horticulture-a review
AbstractThis review paper focuses on the effects of various kinds of climatic changes on horticultural crops and the possible strategies available to combat such changes. The climate of India is generally characterized by a wide variability in temperature and precipitation, resulting in wide range of agro-climatic conditions. In addition, the country is also experiencing a rise in temperatures and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. Climate changes, particularly the increase of temperature, have a strong effect on crop development, which in turn affects the crop growth parameters. Climatic changes can influence the productivity of crops by either increasing or decreasing their growth potential. This review also discusses various adaptation strategies such as changing cultivars, changing growing practices, shifting the cropping seasons and developing new crop varieties that can withstand the adverse impacts of changing climate.

Abstract
The Green revolution in the Indian subcontinent has often been viewed as an example of a technology-led agricultural productivity growth that has been beneficial to climate change. However, the evidence is mixed, with both positive and negative effects on Indian climate. This study examines the climate impact of the green revolution (1974–1989) using an integrated assessment model [the IMAGE model, IMAGES). We find that a 10% increase in agricultural area leads to 0.1%–0.4% decline in annual average temperature, and a decline of up to approximately 1.5% in precipitation, for the period from 2001 to the end of 2100 compared to a base scenario. The results are sensitive to assumptions about crop yields, fertilizer use, land use and land cover change, as well as climate response to changes in land",47,185,0.5697674418604651,7.472429946297629,0.8907182900969111,0.048884061419240975,0.8266666666666667,0.8589189189189197,0.8070010147172356,48.90856844305121,56.866279069767444,60.01533166458073

The precipitation of different rain drop sizes can impact climate in many ways. However, the current global precipitation datasets only contain a limited set of data for rain drops with diameters smaller than 0.2 mm – a major gap in data coverage. This study investigates the impact of precipitation with smaller drops on climate and assesses uncertainties in the global and regional precipitation estimates by using a global meteorological model [model meteorology 4] with 20 rain-drop size subdomains, and compares the results to observations and reanalyses. In the study, we focus on the Indian summer monsoon ([July",52,180,0.5933333333333334,7.266819570256762,0.8958218082686725,0.04787399944639076,0.9266666666666666,0.9060317460317457,0.8202539312022974,78.69584002198215,73.19333333333333,69.94047619047619

Indian climate,Possible impacts of Indian Ocean dipole mode events on global climate,"Possible impacts of Indian Ocean dipole mode events on global climate variability: A review
The Indian–Ocean Dipole is a natural phenomenon occurring in the Indian and Pacific oceans and its impacts on tropical climate and weather have been the subject of much scrutiny. This phenomenon is characterised by an alternation of warm and cool conditions in both the northern and southern oceans which can have significant impacts in other climatic regions of the planet. The dipoles are thought to have a strong link to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and are therefore often used as a proxy for the strength of tropical ENSO activity. It is important to understand the impact that IOD events have on climate as it is believed that these events can influence global surface temperatures for up to several years following the original events. In this review, we summarise the most recent research on the IMD and attempt to quantify the impacts that this event can cause on different atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.",54,183,0.5580110497237569,7.50727087709638,0.8877797734776209,0.049706024485297436,0.8971428571428571,0.8899363057324841,0.7972630225866107,64.39007526281452,66.32596685082873,68.13518299881937

Abstract
Australia is the world’s largest coal producer, with exports totalling more than one-fifth of world exports. In 2014, Australia was the largest exporter of coal globally and the third-largest exporter in 2002. Australia is also one of the highest emitters of carbon dioxide in the industrialised world (IPCC, 1993). Australia has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian Government has a number of international obligations to limit its greenhouse gas emissions in order to help curb climate change. This includes a commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below ‘business-as-usual’ levels by the year 2020. It is expected that the current Australian emissions profile will be in excess of 50 million tons of CO2-eq [1] by that date. However, there is some disagreement as to the best approach towards achieving that target. One approach has been to",55,196,0.6,8.270429251254134,0.902644695976084,0.04272304999680891,0.8514285714285714,0.8669879518072283,0.8228263652091744,66.14323695579927,71.30526315789474,61.305788590604024

The Indian climate is very diverse, from the tropical monsoonal forests of the Eastern Ghats to the snow-clad mountain ranges.
These forests are also highly sensitive to climate variability and climate extremes. In the future, forests will face increasing threats from changing climate, including:
- Droughts and fires
Drought is a natural phenomenon in the dryland areas of India and is exacerbated by climate. Increasingly severe droughts, and the associated heat waves, will threaten forests and forest resources. The forests may also be susceptible to fire, as climate and temperature extremes increase and cause an increase in fire intensity. This could threaten forest ecosystems, the wildlife and human livelihoods that rely on them. It could also increase the spread of invasive and non-native plants and animals.",56,183,0.5159235668789809,6.464503764187739,0.8691130383780303,0.05960516523529064,0.8533333333333334,0.8622556390977448,0.7392634918130532,49.77799479166667,50.37579617834395,47.05246422893482

Indian climate,Indian agriculture and climate sensitivity,"Indian agriculture and climate sensitivity : an empirical approach
The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector of India by estimating the relationship between rainfall and its components. We use an error correction and cointegration methodology to identify the long-term equilibrium relationship for the variables and also to check the existence of a long run relationship. The empirical results indicate that rainfall is a leading indicator of agricultural activity in India. This implies that agricultural development in the country is highly dependent on rainfall variability. Our analysis also indicates that India’s agricultural economy is not very climate sensitive. In this case, climate is an input for production of food in agriculture rather than being a major factor for determining its productivity. Thus, the impacts of projected climate changes would have little direct effect on agricultural production.

Excerpt
Climate change and its impacts have been identified as two of the biggest risks facing agriculture in the 21st century. This study, funded by the European Science Foundation in partnership with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, aims to assess climate-related risks to agriculture through the lens of air quality and greenhouse gas fluxes. The study was conducted over a period of two years in collaboration with Indian partners. Results have shown that there is strong spatial variation in agricultural productivity, with productivity declining by 10-30% by mid-century for most crops in most locations, particularly for maize and wheat.

A team of researchers from the Tata Energy Research Institute, the Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) and the International Crops Research Center in the Dry Tropics of India conducted field investigations in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. They examined how farmers in all five regions have managed to adapt to the consequences of climate variability and change, with special emphasis on agricultural practices. Their findings indicate there are multiple cost-effectiveness opportunities available to farmers who wish to make the switch from water-intensive rice cultivation. These include growing more crops in drier regions, switching from conventional rice to drought-tolerant varieties, growing millets, using organic practices, shifting to low-cost solar irrigation,",62,180,0.6187845303867403,8.324894437968263,0.9076659740144446,0.040897773054742965,0.8742857142857142,0.8761783439490446,0.8202684877438028,65.11824398316016,72.42541436464089,76.2400654511454

The data set was constructed to capture farmers’ perceptions of temperature, rainfall patterns, crop performance, farm management, fertilizer use, pesticide use and knowledge about climate. In a first step, the data were used to construct a set of variables that captured farmers' knowledge and perceptions about changing temperature and precipitation. Then, these variables were combined to create measures of passive climate adaptation that we use as explanatory variables in a second step. Our results suggest that farmers are actively adjusting their agricultural practices to adapt to higher temperatures. However, they are passive when it comes to changing their knowledge. We argue that the reason for this may be that they do not have enough scientific and technical knowledge to be",63,184,0.4896907216494845,6.8206025068685125,0.8644645991019357,0.059242634151779355,0.8914285714285715,0.9042352941176457,0.7772143994746459,58.19115861367162,60.16494845360825,55.57847394540943

Abstract
The experimental investigation and analysis of solar energy thermal cooker (SET) was made by using a paraboloid dish solar collector and phase-change thermal energy storage [TCS] unit. The solar radiation was absorbed by the parabola dish & concentrated to a small area with the aid of lens. Solar radiation is absorbed 70% by parabasol dish with a 5% efficiency. Thermal energy from the absorbed solar was stored in the TCS and the energy was released to the cooker when necessary. A mathematical model was developed for SET and its simulation was performed using Matlab. In the present study SET with Tcs has a capacity of 1 kW to supply 50 kW/h energy. This energy is equivalent to 40% of the cooking energy consumed in daily life in urban and rural areas of India. It is found that the efficiency",65,183,0.5135135135135135,6.984538909891174,0.8723307460621644,0.056312123311349355,0.9142857142857143,0.8770186335403728,0.7795968931022295,55.53921568627451,58.513513513513516,50.156860902255644

Abstract
The Indian subcontinent is a very important region for the global climate system, as it is situated in a region of intense monsoonal precipitation and also plays a key role for global food security. India’s vulnerability to climate change is therefore high. In addition, the region is very vulnerable to the effects of climate changes. Climate change affects all sectors of the economy, but agriculture is the most affected and has to adapt in many different ways. This paper discusses the impacts of changing climatic conditions on Indian agricultural yields, crop production and the Indian farmer, with a brief review of past research and a detailed analysis of present and future projections. The analysis shows that the changes in temperature, precipitation, and evaporation are expected to have strong effects on crop yield, water management, pest management and irrigation scheduling. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for adaptation measures, such as improved crop varieties, diversification",67,181,0.5263157894736842,7.2547625011001164,0.8776727765405299,0.05368163693008349,0.8457142857142858,0.8556626506024091,0.7742365813618396,57.118089630356565,52.810526315789474,48.411742424242426

Abstract
This paper examines the coverage of climate issues in three Indian languages (English, Hindi, and Malayalam), focusing on climate science and political issues of the Kyoto Protocol. This study explores how the media in each of these languages presents the issue of global climate in a manner that reflects the cultural and ideological background of each nation. The analysis reveals significant differences between the way these issues are addressed and framed in these three languages. While English has the least amount of coverage, this is due in large part to the fact that this coverage is often in specialized magazines. In addition, there are significant discrepancies in how climate is framed and discussed in Hindi and English. Finally, a comparison of how issues such as climate are discussed across all three newspapers reveals that Malayali newspapers are more likely to discuss the political dimensions of this issue than the Hindi or English newspapers.

Indian climate,India and climate change: Evolving ideas and increasing policy engagement,"India and climate change: Evolving ideas and increasing policy engagement
This paper presents a study of India’s response to climate policy since it first entered discussions at the UN climate negotiations over a decade ago. The findings of this review suggest that India has become increasingly engaged in the climate regime, both by contributing to global climate efforts and by drawing on international climate knowledge to inform its domestic climate policies. India remains, however, a highly vulnerable country which will continue to face significant challenges in adapting to the effects of climate variability and change. In order to address these challenges, the paper argues for a stronger focus on developing and deploying climate-resilient agricultural policies and technologies, as well as on enhancing India's climate monitoring capacity, including through regional cooperation. Finally, this paper highlights that the country has yet to formulate climate adaptation strategies, which are needed to ensure that its development objectives are aligned with a changing climate.",71,186,0.5955056179775281,7.945035903356131,0.8999679451777178,0.04445039357970997,0.8914285714285713,0.8953246753246751,0.8055377151330881,85.17697594501718,76.30337078651685,74.96792668957617

© 2017, Springer Nature. River water is a vital resource for human survival. However, the impacts of climate change on river flows have received very scant attention. Here we review recent studies on the hydrological response in Indian subcontinent, and discuss the key drivers affecting the climate sensitivity and the magnitude of the changes in river flow in India. The studies reviewed show a wide range of hydrologic responses from climate extremes, such as floods, droughts, heatwaves, heavy rainfall, etc. We found that the change in hydrologeographic features in the river basin (e.g. change of basin extent, basin water storage capacity, change to hydromorphological features, land-use changes, changes to channel morphology and vegetation) and changes of key",72,189,0.5536723163841808,7.366131074427723,0.8857872580109284,0.05080698409457388,0.8228571428571428,0.8135947712418313,0.7673315072541589,46.37588967971531,39.847457627118644,39.53169548074007

A new study led by a scientist at the University of Exeter and published in Scientific Reports demonstrates how the Indian Ocean influences regional climate changes in the North Pacific, which are projected to intensify in coming decades due to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.
The study, led Dr. Andrew King at University College London, is the first to examine in detail the relationship between the climate of the tropical Pacific and changes occurring in its eastern region. The study uses the state-of-the-art ocean and sea surface temperature models to understand the mechanisms by which changes over the eastern tropical Indian ocean influence regional changes. These mechanisms include: changes of ocean-atmosphere interaction and the influence of sea-air-ocean feedbacks in both the atmosphere and ocean. They have been able to simulate changes and future warming of up to 2 degrees Celsius in this region as a result of climate model changes alone, highlighting the potential magnitude of",73,190,0.5130890052356021,7.091031131865732,0.872949122219588,0.05569882475402382,0.8514285714285714,0.8534131736526943,0.7706116366379946,54.411129123552236,55.27748691099477,46.952719180587735

[1] This study investigates the intensifications of the tropical circulation that occur on time scales of a few years, by comparing two tropical cyclone seasons (1985 and 1991). It is found that these intensifiers – defined here as the ratio of maximum cycloon-monthly precipitation to minimum monthly precipitation — are associated with a shift in atmospheric circulation to the east and north, and are linked with an intensified subtropical anticyclone (<5°S). A similar circulation shift, with associated intensifier, is seen in a 1983–1984 climate season.",74,192,0.6551724137931034,7.056422850727971,0.9110447401184962,0.04308891745228247,0.91,0.91,0.8345839464657843,81.08254775799293,76.37068965517241,72.6260593220339

A recent study of the agricultural sector in India by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that the sector is very vulnerable, and that climate-related hazards such as extreme drought, heavy rain and extreme heat events have led to crop damage, livestock deaths, water shortages for irrigation and increased water logging.
The study shows, for example, that more than 50 percent of India’s agricultural output depends on rainfed agriculture. The study notes that while climate projections are uncertain, it expects that crop yields and livestock productivity will decrease in the future in most parts of southern India, northern India and western India. And that in all these regions, the frequency and extent — and, in some cases, intensity – of extreme events will be expected to increase. This will lead to a decline in crop production. It will also cause water stress, which could reduce productivity and increase the risk of crop failure and crop loss.

Abstract
The Indian subcontinents is home to a great diversity of species, both flora and fauna, and has been called the “epicurean paradise” due to its rich biodiversity. This biodiversity has contributed to the development of sustainable practices that have been passed down the generations from generation to generation for over 5,000 years. The climate in this part of the world is highly variable, ranging from extreme heat in the summer months to extreme cold in winter months – this is what makes the subcontinent a place of great climatic diversity. Due to this climatic variation the agricultural practices of this region must adapt to these varying climates. One such practice that has adapted to changes in temperature and precipitation over the last 50 years is cultivation of mustard, Brassica jun",76,187,0.5459770114942529,7.201931413999582,0.882695886646897,0.05235507027708387,0.8266666666666667,0.8349333333333326,0.7906761850784323,58.0,54.14367816091954,48.0851088027902

The monosols of India are characterized by the fact that the soil temperature, at about 5 cm below the surface, fluctuates in a narrow range, and this range is much less than in other soils. The Indian rainfall is highly seasonal. A monomodal distribution is typical, with a maximum during the north-east mon-soon, a secondary maximum in the south-west moni-son and a small residual in between.

Abstract
Climate has been identified as a major threat to agricultural production, especially in developing countries. The Indian subcontinent is the most affected by global climate change, particularly, the increase in temperature, which is predicted to rise up to 2.0-3.5 degrees C in the next 20-50 years, causing an increase of 5%-10% in global mean temperature by the year 2100. Climate change can cause a decrease in agricultural output by reducing yields, reducing the quality of produce and/or increasing input requirements. In this study, we investigate the impact of climate changes on three major crops in Indian Agriculture - maize (corn), wheat & rice.

Abstract
Climate change is the biggest global challenge of this century, and it is affecting India and its agricultural activities. Rice is one of the major cereals, which is being cultivated and consumed across India. The study aims to assess the regional level vulnerability analysis of climate variability and change for rice crop in three major growing regions of India (north, east and western regions). The assessment considers 14 climate variables – mean temperature, maximum temperature; minimum temperature and relative humidity. A multi-criteria decision analysis - 2000 decision support framework was used to analyse the vulnerability. In the first stage analysis, the relative importance of variables is determined and the most crucial variable identified. This is then used for developing the weighting factors in the second stage. Finally, in a ‘bottom-up approach’, the overall regional rice vulnerability index is calculated by combining the weighted variables from the two",80,198,0.5353535353535354,7.533091977898236,0.8818463717970751,0.05144573475660602,0.8685714285714285,0.8503448275862072,0.7856245946440953,56.95548417923126,53.64646464646464,52.475

Abstract
The energy saving of evaporatively cooled buildings with indirect evaporation cooling system is analyzed. In the present paper, the energy analysis of conventional and improved indirect cooling (IC) system was performed. The analysis is performed in the Indian cities of Jaipur and Delhi. For the conventional system, 20 and 30% of energy savings are obtained for winter and summer conditions respectively. It is also found that the improved IC with 50% reduction in water flow rate and with the same evaporating water temperature is more energy efficient than the existing system. Moreover, it is found from the analysis that 15-20% energy reduction may be achieved if the system operates with evaporator temperature of 27°C as compared to 32°c.

Indian climate,Future climate change: Implications for Indian summer monsoon and its variability,"Future climate change: Implications for Indian summer monsoon and its variability
Abstract
The current study examines future climatic trends in the summer Indian monsoons. The study is carried out by using a coupled general circulation model (GCM) with the atmospheric component driven by a 20 year control 1961-80 simulation. Two scenarios of future climate have been considered in this study, the first scenario represents an idealistic scenario and the second represents a realistic scenario. It is observed that in both scenarios the Indian Summer Monsoon will be affected. However, there is considerable difference in their intensity, and their impacts. Under the ideal scenario, both the intensity and frequency of the mon Soons decrease. Whereas, under the realistic scenarios, intensity of summer rainfall is predicted to increase and monSoons will become more frequent and intense. These findings indicate that the changes in summer climate will result in changes to the seasonal mon soons, leading to a significant impact on agriculture, water resources management, energy demand and supply and other human activities in Asia.

This study is an examination of the barriers and challenges to effective climate adaptation by tribal governments in the United States of America.
Abstract:
The climate crisis is real. It is happening as we speak. In the next thirty years, the climate is expected to warm by 2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit in many parts of North America, with the most dramatic temperature increases projected for the far northern reaches of Alaska, Canada, and the Arctic. As this climate shifts, communities in these areas will be impacted by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. These changes will have impacts on the economy and environment. Climate adaptation is necessary for communities to survive and thrive into the future. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reports that adaptation will likely be more cost effective than mitigation, particularly for rural communities. However, there are barriers that prevent some tribes and indigenous communities from adapting to climate changes. This study will address two main questions.

This book is a unique compilation of research contributions on various topics related to climate variability and change, and the impacts of climate change on water resources of the world. Climate change has a strong impact on hydrological regimes, which in turn are responsible for a large extent of global food security. The book will provide a comprehensive overview of recent research and future scenarios related with climate and climate-hydrology interactions and how these affect agriculture, water and food resources.
The first five chapters in the book deal with the impact of changing climate on river flow and its management. Chapters 6 and 7 deal respectively with changes in climate, rainfall and streamflow in South Asia and their impact. Chapter 8 deals with impact, management and adaptation to changing rainfall-runoff regime. This is followed by chapters 13–17 on impact and management of salinity on crops, livestock and aquaculture.

Abstract
This paper presents a study that analyses the climate and environmental risk perception, knowledge and practices of small scale farmers in Himachal Pradesh, one of the states in the western Himalaya of India. The survey was conducted from January to September 2016. A total of 120 farmers (60 from the hill and 60 low land areas) were interviewed. In this study, it was found that farmers were aware that climate is changing but they didn’t have the perception of change of their own environment. This perception was significantly different among different categories of farmers. Hill farmers perceived climate to be changing, whereas lowland farmers did not show any change in their environment and thought of themselves as ‘climate resilient’. The results showed that low-land farmer perceived risk of water, soil erosion and pests as greater than the high-landers. There are several factors that contribute to",86,180,0.5159574468085106,7.074452087647886,0.8736296536801593,0.05556797491465093,0.8514285714285714,0.8636585365853665,0.7766986814174117,49.59723560492337,55.83510638297872,51.277455357142856

South Asia is characterized by large interannual variability in the precipitation regime and by high latitudes. In this contribution, I show that this high variability can be explained by two different mechanisms: First, the annual monsoon circulation has been affected by the western branch of South Asian monsoons which have a more pronounced influence in this region because of their origin in Western Tropical Pacific, where the sea surface temperature and the monoswell amplitude are the highest in that region. The second mechanism is due to the interaction of this westerlies with the South India low, which is located in a narrow band in northern India. It is found that during the winter monomonsol, this interaction creates a region of high pressure in peninuslar India, called the Peninsulat India high,",94,182,0.5524861878453039,7.432941462471663,0.8858656950827842,0.050553832679139876,0.88,0.8822929936305731,0.786401106423206,61.246287855147415,65.13259668508287,68.75697704747

Introduction
The Asian summer monsoon, also known as the South Asian or Indo-Pacific summer circulation (ISSC), is one of Earth's great natural systems that has a profound impact on the hydrological, atmospheric and oceanic climate of Asia. It has the largest precipitation and circulation in the world, transporting ~40% of annual global rainfall to and from the IndoPac – and, in doing so, provides the basis of support for a vast population of >1 billion people () (). This monsoonscale circulation has two main branches, the Asian monSOuth-EastErn Branch ((AME; Fig. 2, a) and the Western Pacific Branch of monSon (), Figs. b and c)).

Impact Of Climate Change On Agriculture
Agricultural production has a strong dependence on climate and weather. Climate and climate variability are the main drivers of crop production and productivity in the country, as well as of food availability in its food supply chain, and of the rural population’s livelihood. A changing climate will have major ramifications for agriculture, including crop yields, agricultural production systems, food prices, rural incomes and the ability of rural communities to feed themselves.
The impact is likely to vary by region and sector with the intensity of vulnerability and adaptive capacity being a determining factor. The most vulnerable states include Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh as per the Climate Impact Index (CII), a measure that assesses vulnerability based on a combination of exposure to climate risk and ability to cope with that risk. These regions also have the largest populations and highest levels of agricultural productivity. It is expected that in these regions",99,186,0.5,6.92820323027551,0.8681601919712955,0.05774087377142206,0.84,0.8476190476190479,0.7763173301964525,57.259883344134806,54.760416666666664,54.322550640760646

Abstract. In this paper a set of experiments is undertaken to investigate the ability of regional atmospheric climate modelling to reproduce the seasonal cycle of the monsoonal precipitation in India. This is accomplished by comparing the simulations of a high-resolution model with an output of precipitation fields with a climatological analysis. The simulations, carried out with the Regional Climate Model (RegCM), use the data from a global climate model – the NCAR-FNL 3.1 - and the regional analysis data. It is found that RegCM is able to simulate the annual cycle and to some extent the interannual variability of mon so nal precipitation, but its performance is limited by the overestimation of both the precipitation amount and of its inter-annual variabil ity.

Abstract
Climate change is a global phenomenon with local impacts. The state is the key institution that can address this problem, but it also plays a key role in creating, exacerbating and managing its impacts and risks. This article addresses the emergence in recent decades of a ‘climate institution’ in New Delhi, India’s political capital. It is shown that this process of institutional emergence is not the product of an unproblematic and linear process, as is usually assumed in institutionalism; rather, it is fraught with difficulties and ambiguities, and it was achieved through the negotiation and contestation of multiple, often conflicting, visions and interests. We argue that the climate institution is, in a way, the (unintended) outcome of the particular way in which climate change has been understood in the Indian political context. Its uneven and ambiguous emergence, we argue, is due in large",103,199,0.517948717948718,7.2327602277982725,0.8752362797652729,0.054481150466322244,0.8457142857142858,0.8563742690058481,0.765695492723418,54.026029373196955,52.14358974358974,48.91344630978777

The global concern about climate change has been growing and it is now widely accepted, that it poses an unprecedented challenge to humanity. The climate of India, too, is changing and the Indian government has recognised the need to take action.
At COP-15, the government of the United States was a major obstacle to the agreement that the majority of nations desired and that would have been in keeping with the scientific reality. At the same time, it was heartening to witness that China and Brazil, two of our main trading partners and neighbours, took a leading role at COP 15. Their participation was significant because they were the world's two largest emitting nations. They took the lead in negotiating a deal. Both countries pledged to reduce their emission by at least 40% by 2020 and to peak emissions by mid-century.

Abstract
The Indian Hindu Kush–Himalayas – the highest mountain range in Asia and the third most important mountain system on the planet - is the centre of the largest contiguous mountain region in Earth’s cryosphere. As such, the Himalayas are an important indicator of global changes and are a major source of water for Asia’ and its people. The region has a very complex and dynamic climate that controls and shapes the hydrological cycle through the large amount of snowpack and permafrost",106,192,0.5849056603773585,7.37537974717874,0.8941971109195418,0.04806170041360367,0.8533333333333334,0.8370370370370369,0.7785132875916585,61.850632999930056,63.0251572327044,59.1469764837626

ABSTRACT
The paper provides an estimate of the potential impact (both positive and negative) of recent Indian climate conditions and climate projections on major food crops. This is done by applying a stochastic simulation technique to estimate the yields and yields variability of major crops in India under current climate and projected climate scenarios. We find that a significant reduction in mean and range of crop yield is possible by the end of this century, due to climate warming in the future. However, the magnitude of impact depends strongly on the climate model used for projection. The impacts vary from crop, region, climate scenario, and model. For example, for wheat, yield decrease due temperature increase is highest in models with high temperature sensitivity, while it is very low in other models. Further, temperature and yield",107,180,0.5210526315789473,7.182214876089116,0.8757573411022161,0.05452219969979796,0.8514285714285714,0.843614457831325,0.7758810595285559,42.75,54.3421052631579,50.16313468158347

Abstract. Evaporation - a key component of surface water, and an important part of water resources, has a large impact on the hydrological system. In this study, we used the Community Climate System Model version 4. We performed three experiments of simulations: one without the effect of climate variability and change; second with climate changes as projected by the fifth IPCC’s report; the third one with the effects of both climate variation and climate warming. The study was carried out in the period of 2001–2100 for 21 Indian stations. Our results showed that the evaporation has increased in 70 % of stations in all experiments, but increased at higher rates in case of IP5 scenario (+ 6.4 mm yr- −1 ) and",108,187,0.6337209302325582,8.311172083126955,0.911384733555521,0.039639516360018744,0.8933333333333332,0.8737837837837843,0.8306578528060006,90.4704743624852,83.44186046511628,66.5167493796526

This study examines the impacts of heat stress on the health and economic outcomes of urban residents in India. Using data from the India Meteorological Department, the study finds that the frequency of extreme heat events has increased substantially in both urban and rural areas of the country in recent decades. In 2020 alone, 14 Indian states experienced a heat wave, which resulted in more than 2000 deaths.
The study estimates that heat-related health impacts have a significant negative effect on Indian economic welfare. The average daily GDP loss due to extreme weather-triggered heatwaves in 2019 is estimated to be more or less equivalent to the total annual health expenditure of an average Indian household. This estimate is even more significant for vulnerable populations such as women, elderly, low-income and low education groups, as they tend to bear a higher health burden.

Abstract
Water is one of the most essential resources required by the world, especially the developing countries like India. The sustainable management and utilisation of water is a major issue globally. In the last decade, groundwater has been the focus of attention in terms of its availability, quality, quantity and sustainability. It is estimated that India has over 30% of world’s population, yet the country has only 6% freshwater.

The Indian Himalayas is a region that is extremely sensitive to climatic variations. The mountain glaciers, the cryospheric components, have been declining in number and area since the beginning of 20th century. This is because of the anthropogenic activities, like deforestation, forest fragmentation, mining, construction and other anthropocene stressors. There is no dearth of literature on the impacts of climate change in Himalayan regions. What is more worrisome is that the glaciers in high altitudes are declining at an alarming rate, causing floods and landslides in lower regions, affecting lives, livelihoods and property. In addition to this, it is also affecting the agriculture of these regions in a negative way due to climate variability and change. Thus there is need for urgent action to save the Himalaya and its cryogenic components.",111,192,0.5625,7.115124735378853,0.8866316374866752,0.051434751014197526,0.8533333333333334,0.8588235294117643,0.753238087653732,60.18565941101153,55.8875,56.92290660225443

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between job satisfaction, organizational commitment and effectiveness for the first time in India. A sample of 1000 respondents drawn from 30 different industries, from different levels, and from both manufacturing and service sectors, completed a questionnaire which included measures of job satisfactions, commitment, effectiveness, leadership and management style. The results indicated that a significant and strong positive relationship existed between all the variables except between leadership style and job performance. It was also observed that the dimensions of climate, namely, communication, role clarity, reward and performance, had a higher effect on overall job effectiveness than leadership or the management",112,182,0.5919540229885057,7.808409848862705,0.8983677668536093,0.04536041027631624,0.86,0.8634666666666673,0.8017415241039039,61.13987092079057,64.33908045977012,52.4277318640955

Abstract
Indian sub continent has the highest concentration of river systems and its river water is used extensively for irrigation, drinking water supply and power generation purposes. Climate change is expected to have significant impact on river system, which may alter the water availability at different scales. Hydrological sensitivity is a key measure which assesses the response of hydrology to a climate variable. In this study, hydrological and meteorological data was used to identify the most sensitive Indian River Basin to rainfall changes, and the findings were compared with other basINSIGHTS articles. The analysis revealed a wide distribution of water-sensitive basInsights regions in all river basin. However, most of the regions were water sensitive to both rainfall and temperature. It is evident that hydrologically sensitive regions are more prone to the changes in rainfall than temperature, but a region’s hydraulically and thermally-induced sensitivity to water changes are highly inter-connected across different basRiver basINg",115,196,0.5368421052631579,7.399857751122119,0.8814468448550337,0.05202543842186139,0.9085714285714285,0.8973493975903614,0.7971350185831235,63.333333333333336,63.2,59.713239436619716

Abstract. A long-term (~ 50 000 yrs BP) Indian-Ocean based climate model was used to understand the linkages between the summer Indian monsoons and Northern Hemisphere climate. The model is coupled to a 5° resolution ocean general circulation and sea surface temperature (SST) model, forced by the observed atmospheric circulation of the Northern-Hemisphere summer – the ECHAM5/MPI-OM and ECE-MRI coupled runs. It has been observed that the Indian summer-monsoon is more efficient in transporting heat from the tropics towards the higher latitudes during inter-glacials. During glacial conditions, the heat transported is lower. In contrast, during glacia-interglacia transitions, a similar trend of heat transport can be seen for both the interglacial and glaciations.",119,200,0.5777777777777777,7.751702321999271,0.8943634681549878,0.04683980831849556,0.8514285714285714,0.8617948717948719,0.8004641923534529,70.36843911927684,60.388888888888886,57.741934536052185

Abstract
The paper presents an assessment of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with food consumption in India, based on an analysis of the current state of affairs and projected future trends in food supply, consumption, and production, with a focus on the food-energy-water nexus. Food consumption patterns and the associated GHG emissions are analysed for 2002 and 2050, using a bottom-up life cycle assessment [LCA] approach and a multi-regional input-output modelling framework. Emissions are estimated in terms of their direct emissions – emissions directly associated to the crop production -- and indirect emissions, which include the emissions caused by the generation of electricity, cooking fuel and refrigeration for food preservation. The results suggest that food is the biggest source of GHGs associated food in the country, accounting for almost 50%, followed by animal products (~20 %), and other",122,191,0.578125,8.010734985006058,0.8957744834867823,0.045646853425641336,0.8685714285714285,0.8659523809523807,0.800968186037397,67.82337799776218,63.59375,56.93747189748201

Abstract/Description
An experimental study of the genetic effects on head growth and shape variation was conducted in a tropical rice population. The effects of maternal and paternal environments are shown to act independently but in different ways, with the maternal factor being dominant. These effects, which are expressed mainly at the level of head length, can be explained by a maternal-mediated interaction between the two parents.

A new book by a group of Indian researchers explores what is being done to improve the climate resilience of India’s 400 largest cities.
The Indian urban system is changing rapidly, with more than a quarter of the Indian population now living in cities that have over a million inhabitants. These rapidly growing cities are also more densely populated than any other, and the majority are located in the ‘sunbelt’, an area extending from Mumbai in western India across to New Delhi in north India. As such, they are among the most vulnerable to climate change. The Indian government has acknowledged this vulnerability and in its latest Five-Year Plan, 2020-2025, it has pledged a total of around $30 billion in support of climate action. However, in order to achieve the ambitious climate targets that India has committed to, much more action is needed. And it is this challenge that lies behind the work of researchers at the",127,190,0.5515463917525774,7.6821522972097975,0.8870453025433731,0.04937259028127049,0.8628571428571429,0.8861176470588228,0.8013130285530564,72.3626455906822,67.80412371134021,72.57762324739937

Abstract. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report [IPCCC, Fourth Assessment, AR4] was published in 2007 using simulations of the twentieth century based on the HadGCRN1 climate dataset. This dataset contains daily data from 1851 to 1998. However, this data has been supplemented with monthly data up to January 2020. In this paper, we analyse the tropical Indian ocean – which includes the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian subcontinent - variability over the 20th century in these climate models by using the CRU TS3H dataset as an independent reference for comparison purposes. Our results indicate that most of these models simulate the Indian summer monsoon circulation well",130,189,0.6729559748427673,8.485651967184141,0.9218617373781024,0.03549485086477438,0.9066666666666666,0.9037037037037032,0.8527916381087435,95.50573005093379,112.55974842767296,100.44984326018809

Climate change impacts and mitigation priorities for Indian Agriculture were presented on 22nd August, 2014. The presentation focused on the impact that global warming could have on agriculture. It started with an overview of the Indian agricultural sector followed by an analysis of how climate changes affect the crops. In addition, the presentation also dealt with the impacts on food security and agriculture productivity as projected by various international organisations. Subsequently, it focused upon the adaptation and adaptive capacity of Indian farmers. Finally, a brief overview was provided on how the agricultural practices in the country are changing to adapt to the climate.

Indian climate,Urban green space planning for climate adaptation in Indian cities,"Urban green space planning for climate adaptation in Indian cities: a review
Abstract:The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change have led to the growing need to understand, plan and adapt to urban green spaces in cities. There is a need for a critical examination of the planning of urban greens in the context of adaptation to extreme events. The review aims to explore the role of green in adaptation, the extent of their planning in urban spaces, and to assess their potential contribution to adaptation. We found that urban trees, vegetation and green infrastructure are increasingly considered by local authorities as key elements of climate resilience through urban heat island mitigation, biodiversity conservation, water cycle regulation, urban cooling and air quality improvement. Urban tree-planting programmes are a key adaptation response in India, while green roofs and vegetative green walls are being increasingly implemented at large scale in many Indian and international cities as part of a broader suite of measures to adapt urban environments to future extremes.

Abstract/Description
Climate change is a global issue, but its impact is unevenly distributed. The 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change call for a rapid reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases, a shift towards renewable energies, sustainable urbanization and other climate-related measures. As climate impacts are felt in cities, the urban context is an important place for climate action and resilience planning. However, spatial planning has so far played an under",136,198,0.6170212765957447,8.460169506877884,0.9077901034421786,0.040546832132904415,0.8914285714285715,0.8853658536585358,0.8242298936335857,94.43973582828839,75.43085106382979,78.17442028985508

Summary
In this paper, we investigate the climate sensitivity or the change of agricultural yields in response to climate variability for India’s agricultural sub-sectors. Using a panel dataset on 26 major crops for 2000–2010 from 13 Indian states, this study shows that climate is a key factor in determining the agricultural yield variability. Our analyses also reveal that spatial variation exists and that the impact of climate on the yield of a particular area depends on its distance from the climatic zone, and the crop types grown in an area. The results indicate that there is spatial heterogeneity in the sensitivity to climatic change in terms of its effects on agricultural production and yields.
The paper also examines the relationship between climate and agriculture using two types of statistical analysis. First, using an error correction model, the results show that Indian agricultural sectors respond to the variability in climate in a lagged manner. Second, a vector error-correction",138,191,0.4816753926701571,6.656886368690279,0.8609202546278586,0.06097225379037469,0.9085714285714285,0.8938922155688614,0.781561597722078,66.28910486269663,64.41361256544502,65.24009620826259

Climate Change (CC) is one of several threats to the desert ecosystem. It is a global phenomenon with a local effect on the climate of any particular area.
The deserts of Rajasthan form the largest desert eco-region in India. The deserts cover approximately 1,30,000 km2 or 13.1 per cent of India’s total area, with an average annual average rainfall of less than 150 mm. These deserts form a vital part of our ecosystem and are the main habitat for a number of species, such as the endangered Great Indian Bustard, the Desert Fox, and the Blackbuck antelope. Many migratory birds also visit this area every year on their way north and south. Desert ecosystems are also important in the water cycle, storing rainwater in their sand and rock layers, thus maintaining the fragile equilibrium of desert ecosystems. They are a key source for water supply for millions of people in Rajasthan.

Abstract
This article investigates how traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of time and season is embedded in climate-change related TEK among three Indian communities. It shows that climate season-time-related knowledge is a complex phenomenon which is influenced by many factors including: cultural context; ecological and meteorological conditions in a particular location, social context and historical factors. The article also explores how time-seasonal knowledge can help us understand the dynamics of the local climate in relation to cultural and ecological changes as well as to climate impacts and risks. Finally, the study illustrates how the knowledge about seasonal and temporal variations in weather and climate can be integrated into climate and disaster management plans.",140,186,0.5555555555555556,7.264831572567789,0.8856816167680313,0.05119506599225218,0.8599999999999999,0.8688435374149661,0.8020684961501563,60.6252276867031,62.62573099415204,64.0384737577837

AbstractWe present an analysis of the climate sensitivity to the radiative forcing due to changes in atmospheric constituents in models that simulate tropical ocean and sea level rise over the past century. We find the simulated oceanic heating by anthropogenic radiatively forcing is mainly due 1/3 to increased surface wind speed – 2/1 to enhanced evaporation - 3/4 to a stronger ocean-atmosphere coupling and 4/5 to reduced latent",142,199,0.7209302325581395,8.188193428828301,0.9326696415452697,0.03190120662778361,0.8800000000000001,0.8746666666666666,0.8499937668623734,111.37704918032787,113.51162790697674,73.46190476190476

The monsoons in the tropics are driven by large-scale patterns and associated with the large interannual and interdecadal variation of their atmospheric circulation. A number of studies have investigated their relationship with ENSO, which in turn is a major component of large scale atmospheric phenomena. In this contribution, the monoseasonal variability of Indian monomodal summer rainfall in India is analysed. The monimodal character of rainfall was confirmed using the monthly rainfall data for six meteorological stations in southern peninsular India. This study is carried out using 30-year monthly average (1981–2011) precipitation data.

The Indian summer monsoon has been regarded as a climate indicator of major global scale in many previous studies, and it is of great scientific interest to understand its past behaviour. The Indian monsoonal rainfall regime is strongly influenced by climate in the Indian Ocean, the North Atlantic, Pacific Ocean and East Asia.
However, there are some discrepancies and uncertainties in climate reconstructions of the ISM over the last several millennia and in particular over past 1000 years. This is mainly due to the lack of direct climate proxies (e.g., pollen) and the paucity/uncertainty of other proxies. In this paper, recent studies from both direct and indirect proxies and models will be critically evaluated to address this issue.",144,198,0.6206896551724138,7.474093186836597,0.9041692610506536,0.044338002066400546,0.8959999999999999,0.9024793388429755,0.800308685161052,67.33618233618233,68.37931034482759,56.369960343688035

Abstract
The present scenario depicts the impact of climatic change which will be the major factor in determining the fate of groundwater in the future. Ground water is the most important source of drinking and irrigation water and it can meet up to the requirements of a majority of people living in rural as well as urban areas. The present study is based on comprehensive assessment of hydro-meteorological parameters to investigate their impact on ground water resources of India. A comprehensive literature review is presented and analyzed in order to understand the present status and the possible effects on hydrosphere of global climate changes in India, in this regard, the main emphasis has been laid on the hydrological changes and their impacts. It is concluded that the changes will affect all the three components of water cycle, viz., precipitation, evaporation, and transpiration. However, there is a wide variation in precipitation change among regions. As precipitation is an important parameter that governs the availability of ground waters,",146,191,0.4975369458128079,7.088810304070324,0.8686131377262313,0.056939149673508695,0.86,0.838659217877095,0.7540515988584057,50.75,50.310344827586206,47.8632637017071

This paper investigates the media coverage of climate issues in Australia, India and Germany over the 15 years of 2000-2014. We analyse how issues are framed by the print press, how the coverage varies over time and whether the climate debate influences media reporting on other environmental issues. By using a quantitative text analysis of all climate articles in three national newspapers over a period of almost two decades, we find that the frequency of coverage and the framing of the issue differ markedly from one country to the next and that media reports on climate in Germany have become increasingly prominent.

Abstract
In the western Himalaya, the impacts of climate change are beginning to have serious implications for communities, livelihoods, and ecosystems. We present a local level analysis of how climate variability and change is perceived by residents of the upper Kali River Valley (UKRV) of Uttarakhand and how this has been manifested in terms of changes in livelihood practices and adaptation measures. A series of interviews with community representatives (‘panchayat’) and key informants ('kumaonis') and observations of agricultural fields and livestock were conducted. The UKRV is characterized by high levels of precipitation during the main monsoon season, a ‘dry’ period of around three months from May to August, an increase in average summer temperatures, changes to precipitation and temperature patterns during winter season and an earlier onset of spring snowmelt. These climate conditions have led to significant",148,181,0.5580110497237569,7.50727087709638,0.8877797734776209,0.049706024485297436,0.8571428571428571,0.8560509554140128,0.7948223050328311,53.4482984609229,54.10497237569061,52.05399504692388

Abstract
The paper presents a synthesis of the current literature on the impacts of climate change on water and agricultural production in India, and explores the possible adaptation strategies available. It is based on secondary analysis and draws from a comprehensive set of studies on agricultural impacts. We present evidence suggesting that, due to the increasing severity of water deficits, the production of major food crops (cereals, rice, wheat and pulses) will decrease significantly in the near future. The most vulnerable crops to climate variations seem to be rice and wheat. A decline in rice yields may reach up to 40% by 2075 due primarily to water scarcity, although climate variability is expected to increase. Wheat production may decline by up 30% over the same period. Our analysis reveals a strong association between temperature and crop yield variability, as well as between water deficit and yield variation.",149,186,0.5396825396825397,7.419408268023741,0.882334229407988,0.051688005648197276,0.8742857142857143,0.8843636363636361,0.8095183387695533,54.60893617021276,63.10582010582011,59.56176846137476

Abstract. The Indian summer monsoons play a crucial role in the economy of Asia and the Pacific, and their predictability for agricultural production can help to mitigate the adverse impacts of a more variable and less predictable rainfall. Here we assess the climatic impacts on Indian summers of both ENSO and its counterpart, the IOD/ENSO-like oscillations, using a 30-year reanalysis product from ECMWF and climate simulations from the EC-Earth global climate model. Our analysis of the climate data sets indicates a close connection between the two climatic modes and a common source region in central Africa.

Abstract
Agriculture in India relies heavily on the use of groundwater. However, in a context of climate and land-use change it is necessary to assess the impact of this practice on water availability and on land and groundwater quality. The present article examines the effects of increased use, by Indian farmers, of water from aquifers that are recharged mainly through rainfall, and which are subject to seasonal fluctuation, on groundwater levels and its quality (“pulse irrigation”). It uses an original data set of “water pulse” surveys conducted over the last 40 years in 10 Indian agro-climatic zones (ACZs). The results show that pulse irrigation has become more widespread over this period and that, while the water-pump technology used in the practice is generally appropriate, its use has increased the risk of salinization in areas with a high potential for salinity",152,181,0.5469613259668509,7.358612047846947,0.883932379396913,0.05141016170107928,0.8742857142857143,0.8861146496815286,0.8042271073868469,64.55543432658445,68.86187845303867,62.901952214452216

Climate-change adaptation in the agricultural sector in India is of critical concern, since agricultural productivity is highly susceptible to the impacts of global climate change. This paper examines local perspectives about how climate variability affects apple production in Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, North India. The paper is based on a survey with 250 apple growers in 2012 and 210 respondents in a follow-up survey in March/April (2015). The analysis focuses on local adaptation strategies and the impact of extreme weather events in terms of lost income, crop damage and changes in farm production. It is shown that apple-farming communities in this region have a high level of awareness and concern for climate impacts, but they have limited understanding of what is actually happening and what the possible consequences might be. In general, the majority of respondents did not report significant changes and were not able to identify specific reasons",153,181,0.5721925133689839,7.824614938160297,0.8932769660729453,0.04697644132407527,0.9085714285714285,0.9013496932515337,0.8019943232814685,70.46988448844886,75.00534759358288,80.52322984141166

Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are an efficient and flexible technique for visualising multidimensional data, particularly when the data are highly complex; they are also a valuable tool for detecting patterns. In this study, SOM models were used to examine relationships between sea surface temperature [SST = Ts] anomalies in 10–200 m layer and atmospheric variables in southern tropical Indian ocean – the region of strong El Niño events. The study period included 1986–2011 and data were provided by National Centres for Environmental Prediction & National Oceanic + Atmospheric Administration “CPC” data archive.

Abstract
This study explores the vulnerability of coastal areas to climate change, specifically sea level rise and associated impacts, in four districts of North Eastern India. A vulnerability profile of 14 coastal districts was created by using the Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI), the Sea Level Rise Vulnerable Index of United Nations Environment Program and the ‘Climate-Related Security Risks’ of Global Institute of Security Studies. The coastal vulnerability was analysed using a geographic information system. It was found that the coastal zones of Assam and Meghalaya are highly vulnerable to sea levels rising as compared to the other two coastal states of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. This is because of their high population density and low elevation as a proportion to",155,180,0.5823529411764706,7.592953389588967,0.8947235578765801,0.04719966510524967,0.88,0.8816438356164386,0.8118074819822266,68.38611154858596,71.87647058823529,69.02104690897795

Glaciation and interannual precipitation changes over the tropical region are often modeled in global circulation models (GCMs) using prescribed sea-surface temperature (“SST”) changes as a result of ocean heat content (""OHC"") variations. These models can simulate the glacial-interglacials “sawtooth” pattern of climate change. However, the models may not reproduce some of key characteristics such as interhemispheric asymmetry and a pronounced interdecadal variability over tropical oceans, both of which are observed in the Last Interglacier – Last Glacial Maximum (<IGM - LIG) period (~120,000 <IGY >130,100 yr).

In the last weeks of May 2019, a major climate-event hit East African lake regions, bringing torrential downpours that led to massive flooding in the region and downstream. The floods caused significant damage to crops and pastures, and also to human life. At least 15 people were reported dead.
This event has had a direct, but also indirect, impact on the livelihoods and food security of pastoralists living around the lake basins. In the East-African Great Lakes region, the floods are part of a climate crisis that has been ongoing for several years. This crisis includes droughts, floods, cyclones, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions, with negative consequences on agricultural and livestock production, health systems and infrastructure.

This study examines the spatial and temporal variations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over India during the past thirty years. The results obtained indicate that there has been no significant changes in NDVIs from 20012007. However, there was an increased NDVIS in 2011 and 0.01 < p >.05 over some regions. An interesting observation is that the regions affected by droughts show a significant increase in the NDVS. This is attributed to a change in precipitation patterns.

Land use, land-cover and climatic change are known to affect aquatic ecosystems. The effects of land use change have attracted much of the recent scientific attention, but the effects on the functioning of wet ecosystems have remained relatively poorly studied.
In the present study, the influence of a changing vegetation structure and its effects are examined on wet meadow ecosystem in the Himalayan foothills, India. Wet meadows in this area are dominated by species of Carex and Juncus, which are typical aquatic wet species. In the wet meadowe studied, a gradual shift from a wet to a dry meadow can be observed. This shift can have implications for the ecosystem. We hypothesized that the vegetation composition of this wet site has been altered by anthropogenic activities, such as land clearance for cropping and shifting cultivation, and is now closer to what it would be in drier conditions.

Abstract
The global atmospheric circulation is driven predominantly by two different kinds of insolarforcing: the meridional temperature gradient and the zonal temperature gradients. These two types offorcing can be either directly derived from the insolaion or can indirectly arise by changes in the atmospheric heat content and moisture budget caused by the solar irradiation. A recent paper has shown by using a simple coupled model that the orbital insolareforcing, in combination with the tropical sea surface temperature forcing, can lead to a global change ofthe precipitation over the tropics, which is a result of changes induced by both meridianallocation and changes of atmospheric water content. In this paper, the authors aim to examine the role ofmeridionalliation and atmospheric humidity changes as an insoleroading mechanism",163,180,0.6363636363636364,8.17423891369599,0.9114786622666826,0.03991971980870331,0.88,0.873191489361702,0.8331001763527206,88.69197247295385,90.44848484848485,82.71248282967034

The Indian monsoon climate is very unstable and has been undergoing significant changes over the past few years, and these changes may be more severe in future. The objective of this present study is to assess the impact of future climate changes on rice-wheat production using a regional crop yield simulation model. For this purpose, three future climates (2050s, 2070-2099s and 2100–2150) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, Representative concentration pathway 8.0, Intermittend Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Regional Climate Model 5 and Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change AR5 were used to simulate rice productivity and yield.

The impact of Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) variability on the coupled general circulation – climate system in a state-of-the-art atmosphere ocean coupled model, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory version 2 [GFLD2] is investigated. GFLDs coupled ocean model is run in both the control experiment and a perturbed SST experiment. For this experiment, a perturbation of 5 K is imposed on 2003 mean sea SSTA. A 7.5% reduction in global mean SLP is found in this case, which leads to a poleward shift in midlatitude westerly winds. An increase in mean global cloud cover also occurs. In both experiments, there is a significant reduction of the meridional ocean heat transport from the Indo-Pacific region.

The Indian monsoonal rainfall season is a highly variable phenomenon in the tropics but is subject to large-scale, persistent variability. This variability is thought to be due to a complex combination of large scale circulation patterns, including the Madden–Julian Oscillation and the El Niño–Southern Oscilation and small scale processes including cloud systems such as the Asian Summer Monsoon Precipitation Enhancement (“ASMOE”) effect and convection-permitting cloud schemes. Here, the impact of domain-level resolutions on the simulation of rainfall over the South Asian region is investigated using the regional Climate Prediction and Applications Center – North American Regional Reanalysis 3 “RCA3",168,186,0.6424242424242425,8.252088808112143,0.9133350753449254,0.0390825488866379,0.8866666666666667,0.8618439716312059,0.844536721715332,89.89072528244841,85.15757575757576,66.82667332667333

Abstract
Biofuelled transport is an important aspect of the current bioenergy policy in India. This article provides an overview of Indian biofuel policies as well as the bio-energy potential of India and its contribution to global climate mitigation. It also describes India‟s bioeconomy policy and the challenges associated with it. The author analyses the global bioethanol and biodiesel markets, highlighting the impact of these global markets on India, and also discusses the role of biohydrogen, biochar, methane and cellulosic ethanol as potential substitutes for bioalcohols. Finally, the author suggests some measures for addressing the key challenges of achieving sustainable bio energy production in a resource-constrained context. He argues that there is a need for more comprehensive policy frameworks that take into account the inter-linkages of global and Indian energy, agriculture, environment and economic policies.",169,184,0.5853658536585366,7.496340570653091,0.8949936740627862,0.04741026146370229,0.8666666666666667,0.8722857142857133,0.7989999007596077,64.64716986220101,61.99390243902439,54.81856540084388

One important component of this work involves a better understanding of how the SPCZ influences the dynamics and structure of tropical and subtropical oceans in both hemispheres. The SPSC may also have an important connection to global circulation and climate. In particular, this research involves an examination of: (1) the role of eddies that are associated with the southern hemisphere SPS in transporting heat and moisture into the subtropics during winter (“winter warmings”), and [2] the transport into midlatitudes of heat from the eastern Indian Ocean.

Abstract:
The North India summer season monSoons are known to exhibit strong interannual variability in terms of their onset timing and their intensity. This variability appears to be connected to the variability of Indian winter mon Soons, which are associated with the El Nio Southern Oscillation, or E NSO. A strong E nSo relationship was reported to exist from 1939 to 2001, but the strength of the E So relationship varied significantly from year to year, especially from the 1960s onwards. In the recent past, the relationship has weakened, and in fact the onset of monSons during the past 50 years has become increasingly earlier. There are several factors associated to this weakening. The first is global warming, caused mainly by increasing greenhouse gases and the second is associated directly with changes in Indian monSon rainfall.

Abstract. The study reviews the available literature on climate-related impacts of extreme precipitation events in the Indian context. It is observed that extreme events are projected to be enhanced under the future climate scenarios of both, the IPCC Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 0.5 °C and 4.0 ° C, while the frequency and intensity are expected to increase with the projected increase in temperature. In the context of future projections of flood events, there is a general upward trend in flood occurrence with increased flood peak discharge and higher recurrence intervals. Under the Special Climate Report scenario, flood peaks have the potential to rise by 2-6 mm/day with a significant increase of the occurrence of floods during the monsoon season.",173,184,0.5114942528735632,6.74707258785224,0.8700500594392814,0.057999144924096815,0.84,0.841866666666666,0.7650172075196768,53.19867549668874,50.90229885057471,43.28929204660588

AbstractThe Indian Himalayan region is the most sensitive region in terms of climate and environmental changes. A better understanding of the potential impacts of these changes on socio environmental systems in this region would enable the development of appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The present study assesses the vulnerabilities of different socioenvironmentally important systems along a height gradient to the climate changes in Himachal Pradesh. For this purpose, the spatial distributions of temperature, precipitation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were extracted from 20km resolution MODIS satellite images for the period 2001–2010. These were then used to generate monthly and yearly maps for temperature and precipitation for four different altitudinal ranges. In addition to this, for two locations in different climatic conditions (< 1500 m and > 4000m), the NDVI values were calculated by using Landsat TM images at a spatial resolution of 30 m.

Abstract
The study investigates the reliability and consistency of climate simulations over the Indian summer monsoonal region using different climate models and downscaling techniques. The reliability is evaluated for the summer of 2006 and 2010 over two regions: India (30oN–30°N, 60oE–90o E) and the North Atlantic Ocean (>10o N,>90° E), using the Standard Observation Network / ERA-Interim 0.5° gridded data. Consistency is assessed by comparing the observed and simulated values of the standard deviation and bias. Reliability and inconsistency are analyzed for two different time scales. It is found that reliability for summer 06 is higher for 3–6-month periods than that of a year. However, reliability decreases over a 12-months period. In the consistency analysis reliability increases with decreasing time scale.

Abstract
We assess the sensitivity of winter wheat yields in the Indian monsoon to past variations in temperature, precipitation and radiation in a historical climatology over India 1871-2011. We find that wheat has been more sensitive to temperature than moisture over the majority of the country, particularly in south-western regions. The sensitivity to moisture has become more important in recent years, with precipitation becoming the main driver of yields. Over the north-east wheat production is more influenced by precipitation, whereas over southwestern India the most important factor is temperature. In the future, we find a decrease for the wheat yield in all regions, and this decline is particularly large for south west India, where wheat is currently most vulnerable to climate change.",177,182,0.48823529411764705,6.365809407433174,0.8603999284548542,0.06258832928524623,0.8666666666666667,0.8734246575342464,0.758817506264622,54.10950661853188,50.26470588235294,49.33341523341523

Abstract
The air quality and health impacts of the growing cities with their large population and increasing motorization in India are a matter of serious concern for the society and the policymakers. A few studies have assessed these impacts in the Indian context, but most of them are focused on the rural areas. This paper provides a review of air pollution and climate-sensitive health issues in urban areas of India. It is found that air pollutants in cities pose significant risks to the health of Indian population with the increasing number of vehicles and rapid urbanization. Air pollution has been shown to be a significant risk factor of a number health outcomes, including premature deaths (mainly from cardiovascular disease, stroke), hospitalizations, reduced lung function, decreased respiratory health & lung cancer. The health effects of climate changes in future may further exacerbate the situation. Therefore, a set of policy measures need to take up to reduce the air and climatic pollutants",179,184,0.5333333333333333,7.447594690010102,0.8807872725114368,0.05205717280300597,0.8742857142857143,0.8811695906432746,0.7814950864953081,67.65888237902453,59.91794871794872,63.897465437788014

Abstract
The study investigates climate changes in future using the regional climate models under the representative pathways of 4.0 and above for three subregions (North East India, North India and South East Asia) of India for the 21st century. These are selected due to their high economic and agricultural production which may be affected in coming decades. It shows that the climate of the North-East and North regions are highly affected by global warming in the future. The annual average temperature increases by up to 0.9 to1°C by the end of century under RCP 8. 5 for these regions with an annual increase of up 3 to4°c in winter season under high concentration pathway Rcp 6.3. However, the annual rainfall increases with the increase in temperature. This is also the main reason for decreasing annual runoff in both these sub regions",180,194,0.5393258426966292,7.19550421436027,0.8808450116004082,0.05294788896176746,0.8914285714285715,0.8802597402597403,0.806893363919713,53.33764483966586,59.151685393258425,58.463763509218055

Abstract
We present a new proxy for the Mediterranean wave index (MWI) reconstructed using the oxygen isotope ratios of benthic foraminifera from the Ligurian Sea. We use the δ18O record to reconstruct the MWI in detail back to ~200 BC. The new MWP-LIA is similar in length to the previous reconstructions, with similar characteristics of the LIA-MWP transition. Our reconstruction of MWS shows a significant variability that is related to North Atlantic variability. This suggests that MTS, and hence MCS variability, is influenced by NAW variability at longer time scales. However, MWD is not related with any significant NAWS variability in this time period. MWR shows the same long- and short-time scales variability of NAWR and MWR, respectively. These long cycles are not directly",182,193,0.5714285714285714,7.406560798180411,0.8907845975918441,0.049078752021136,0.8733333333333334,0.8552777777777772,0.8142377571306658,61.47555093743151,61.595238095238095,49.927974762285615

The southern oscillation (El Niño–Southern Oscilation) is a phenomenon of global significance, with impacts on climate as well as fisheries, agriculture, tourism, shipping, air quality, etc. The oceanic circulation is one of the principal drivers for climate variability in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, the most important being the trade winds and associated currents. In this study, a method of analysis by means of multivariate clustering was used to assess the impact of this phenomenon on surface-water circulation in all the three ocean basins in question. This method is based on the assumption that the circulation of water parcels in space is characterized by an intrinsic pattern or “signature” that can be quantified and used as a basis for clustering. For this purpose the authors used the ocean surface current vector from the NOAA Global Circulation Model. Clustering of time series was carried out using the Ward algorithm and then the clusters were analyzed with respect to their geographical",183,196,0.5336538461538461,7.696465222625054,0.8823412837507801,0.050757334570890836,0.8649999999999999,0.860217391304347,0.7850457285470854,63.2156862745098,63.19230769230769,51.247143701369055

Climate change, being one of the important issues of today’s world, is also an issue of importance for the agricultural community. In spite of its importance, it has been a subject of research in the Indian context in very less. The research objective of this paper is to study the farmer perceptions on climate changes in Uttar Pradesh (North Indian state) of India. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was administered to 100 farmers. Results of study show that farmers perceive a change in their farming conditions due to climate variability, which may be caused by climate-change. This perception is more for those farmers who have more education and experience. Farmers have perceived that climate has changed their agriculture conditions. However, they have not perceived the change due climate warming. They are also of view that temperature changes have led to an increase in crop productivity as well as crop growth time.

Abstract
Climate change is already affecting many parts of the world. The study aims to develop a method for local climate zone classification (LCZ) in Nagaur to improve the climate modeling of future climate change impacts in India. A combination of methods based on the temperature and humidity data from meteorological stations were applied to identify different climate zones. These methods included the cluster analysis method and the K-Means clustering approach to find the most homogeneous groups of stations. Subsequently, the results were validated against the World Climate Map developed by NOAA/NCDC. This was achieved through the application of an expert-based method, i.e., the expert committee was asked to review and select the best groupings of climate stations from the identified zones by the method of cluster and K – means. Finally, this resulted in a classification with six zones for Naguar. In the first stage, a total of 17 stations of meteorology department in the city of Maharashtra were used",188,196,0.5204081632653061,7.285714285714286,0.8762547068196003,0.05398406169655018,0.8914285714285713,0.8741860465116283,0.7759214365103486,62.592841163310965,59.09183673469388,60.3923358520674

The reconstructed record indicates that the enhanced monsoons began to occur in ~ 3000 yr B.P.; this was about 1000 years later than previously proposed. This is likely due to the fact that our reconstructions include records that have been previously overlooked in some studies. We also provide some evidence for the existence of a monoseasonality shift, which occurred between about
200 and

Abstract. A ""Rossby-wave"" mechanism for a significant fraction of the Indian ocean variability has been found by a recent numerical model study. This phenomenon has not been observed by the observational records. The mechanism is a consequence of a 3-dimensional wave mode of Ross by (1990). We present a simple theoretical model to explain the observations of this mechanism by Ross and Schmitt - two authors of our recent paper and discuss the possible implications.",190,193,0.6068376068376068,6.563952321998544,0.8951121767924981,0.05071489228678197,0.8999999999999999,0.8662365591397845,0.7815561937617993,58.27801877272701,54.34188034188034,48.866381766381764

Lomblok ridge is an ocean ridge with a 150-m-thick, 200-km-long, Late Pleistocene-Holocene sequence of basaltic lava flows that are erupted from its flank. The ridge forms a major boundary for the circulation of surface water masses of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans, which in turn control the global oceanic circulation. To better constrain the timing of changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation, and to understand the influence of these changes on the ocean’s heat content, we have analyzed an archive of sedimentary charcoal preserved in Lomblock Ridge, in the Indo-west Pacific, through >1.9 million years (Ma), to reconstruct the fire regimes of its terrestrial environment.

India is a country of diverse ecosystems, with a total area of 3,287,000 km2, comprising of different agro-ecological regions. India is among the highest biodiversity rich countries, yet is the 12th largest global carbon emitter in the world, due to the rapid rate of deforestation and the increasing population of the country. It is also the second most populous country, and has a population that is growing by 1.3% per annum. Climate change is one of many threats to food security, as climate patterns become increasingly uncertain and unpredictable. This research aims to understand the current status of forest resources in India and their impact on the environment and people.

Challenging scenarios for Indian Agriculture
Agriculture in India faces many challenges due to climate change including, but not limited to changing rainfall patterns, higher temperature, changing crop phenology, pests, diseases and water logging. The challenges will have impact on food production and security. These challenges have the potential to increase rural poverty, food insecurity and migration in the long term. However, these challenges also offer a set of opportunities in Indian agricultural sector for the farmers, researchers and other stakeholders. Some of these opportunities have been discussed below.
Farmers
The challenges posed by climate changes have already impacted Indian farmers and their crop. Crop losses due the vagaries of weather are well reported. Farmers are already adapting to the climatic changes to some extent by shifting to crops which can be grown in a wide variety of climates and seasons and by adopting new",194,183,0.520618556701031,7.251377402039155,0.8760905053794897,0.054160941046359504,0.8628571428571429,0.84235294117647,0.791182540260823,57.37841530054645,51.103092783505154,48.690021231422506

Abstract
This paper reviews the literature on climate and rice. This paper presents the results of a survey of the impact of climatic variables on the rice yield in south India. It also provides an analysis of how climate variability may affect rice cultivation in future. The survey reveals the following. There is a clear increase in rice productivity during the period 1959-1979. During the same period, there was no significant change in rainfall or mean air temperature over the state of kerala. However, the number of rice cropping seasons increased from 2.5 in 1980s to 3.25 in early 1990 s. In contrast, it was noted that the rainfall pattern and temperature have changed in keralam. Thus, rice may be less sensitive to the current change of temperature but more sensitive towards rainfall patterns in coming decades.",196,199,0.550561797752809,7.345410552159442,0.8848241988826662,0.05117969134613333,0.8457142857142858,0.8475324675324667,0.7736359282110187,46.97349643221203,47.5,46.013150699912515

Abstract
This study is aimed at understanding the role of Indian ocean dipole in the climate variability of East African region by examining the relationship between SST, sea level pressure and sea surface height anomalies, the ENSO phase and the Indian Pacific SSTA. The results indicate a close link between the SLP of the ITCZ, SSS and Indian EPO. During the warm phase of E-S (1998, 2002) there was an increase in both SLS and SLAI and a decrease in SSAI, while during the cold phase (~1990), a significant increase was observed in all the parameters and there were no significant difference in any of them. A similar pattern is observed during El-Nino /La- Nino periods. It is found that the variability and spatial pattern of SLE - EO is highly correlated",197,181,0.593939393939394,7.629289652782925,0.8979664005632206,0.04601323031132481,0.8866666666666667,0.8604255319148933,0.7914044855914466,56.98470038249044,58.7939393939394,47.826120781872994

Abstract
The late Eurypalaeozoic Indian continent experienced rapid environmental changes during its evolution from a hot and humid environment to a cooler and drier one. It has been proposed that this change was driven by the onset of the South Atlantic Anoxic Event (SAAE) at the base of Epochs 40 – 41. 6 Ma. A key to understanding this climate change is the determination of when tropical and subtropic latitudes occupied the present-day positions. We show that, based on palaeolocations, this region is not the same as the equatorial zone occupied today, but is more comparable to that occupied 50 Ma ago during E",198,189,0.625,7.905694150420948,0.9073916192121428,0.0420160342978542,0.8933333333333334,0.8988235294117646,0.8209214447315616,80.0,83.93125,82.20044512449576

The residential sector is one of the most energy-intensive sectors in the world. A majority of residential energy used for heating and cooling, lighting, appliances, and entertainment. In India, residential electricity consumption is 7.6% of energy consumption, which will likely increase in future.
A residential house is a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions and energy use. It is estimated that 25% to 30% — or 50 million metric tons of CO2 annually – is emitted as a result of its construction. The construction and operation of buildings are major energy consumers, accounting for about 40% and 60% respectively in total building energy usage worldwide. Residential energy accounts for 12%–16% percent of total residential consumption. This is higher than in non-residential buildings and lower than residential space heating in some countries.

Abstract
Coral reefs are among the world’s great biodiversity hotspots, supporting a wide variety of organisms including humans, but they are threatened by climate warming. Coral bleachers are one of the best indicators of coral reef health, and in 1998 bleached and dead corals were found on all coral atolls in French Polynesia, which was previously considered to be an area with little impact of climate changes. The bleaches were not only the longest recorded, lasting almost four months on the atoll of Moorea, in a region that usually has two to three months bleeching, they were also among those longest in terms of area affected. These were the first recorded bleeches for French polynesia and the most extensive bleachings ever reported in any tropical coral region. We review the bleache and their ecological implications with a focus on their relationship to climate variation, the role of local factors such as water quality and sedimentation, reef fish community structure and dynamics,",200,198,0.5824742268041238,8.112927192380441,0.8974022602675605,0.044845555622325936,0.8857142857142858,0.8922352941176461,0.8056471644137048,74.17614565762526,77.1701030927835,66.02072968490879

The Indian monsoon has been a vital element in sustaining the agricultural productivity in India and in surrounding countries for many millennia. In the 21st century, the climate is predicted to become more severe as the mean annual sea surface temperature of the equatorial Indian and Pacific oceans increase and the precipitation is likely to increase, thereby increasing the monsoonal rainfall. However, there are still some uncertainties about the mode shift from the present-day “wet mon So, we have developed a simple climate model, which includes both the land and sea. Based on this climate system, a climate change scenario with two climate modes has also been developed using an atmospheric general circulation model. The first climate mode is the existing mode and it is used as a reference scenario. A second climate scenario is simulated for a future period (2011–2055) using the same model with different initial conditions.

Abstract
The Indian agricultural system has been highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This has become even more severe with the increased occurrence of extreme climate events. In this study, we have investigated the sensitivity of the crop-based crop productivity of two agroecological zones in India—the North Western India (NW) and North-Eastern India. For this purpose, a multi-criteria approach was used in which the impact of various climatic variables on the yield of rice and wheat crops for different agroclimatic zones were evaluated. The results indicate that crop yields in both zones will decline by 30 and 20%, respectively, by the end of this century. Further, the results reveal that the NW agrozone is comparatively more sensitive to temperature variability than the NE agrozones. However, in terms of relative impact on yield, both regions exhibit higher sensitivity in the",206,182,0.5376344086021505,7.332355751067665,0.8812463507183071,0.052325610031986755,0.8514285714285714,0.8585185185185179,0.7940385587384827,56.42446043165468,53.79032258064516,51.90790322580645

Abstract. In the past 50 yr, the climate of northern North America and eastern Asia during the summer has become increasingly dry. To determine the physical mechanisms of this trend, we analyzed the atmospheric circulation and ocean–atmosphere interaction during 1950–2009 by using the coupled climate model MIROC5. The results indicated that the decrease in summer precipitation in the northwestern Pacific during this period was associated with a decrease of 6–10 % in sea surface temperature (>2 °C) over the western North Pacific and an increase of precipitation >30 %. The decrease also occurred in an area that receives more than 90 %, and sometimes more 100 $, of",208,187,0.6190476190476191,8.023774198028779,0.9064058447347364,0.04205894256310998,0.88,0.8933333333333339,0.8131911203581486,77.63636363636363,76.60714285714286,79.05997425997427
Indian climate,Modeling the impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on cereal production: evidence from Indian agricultural sector,"Modeling the impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on cereal production: evidence from Indian agricultural sector
This study analyzes the production of Indian agriculture crops (cereals, pulses, vegetables and potatoes) under climatic / non climatic stresses, using a stochastic production model. The stochastic model is calibrated to the 1989-90 data from the National Sample Survey Office, Government of India using maximum likelihood method. Using the calibrated model, the effects of climate and other nonclimate factors - on crop production – have been examined for a range of scenarios. Results suggest that climatic shocks are likely to have more impact on the yields of crops than non climate shocks. In addition, crop specific impacts vary substantially across crops. Climate shocks, particularly precipitation shocks have the largest impact, followed by temperature shocks in case of cereals and pulses and temperature shock in potato production. Other climate variables, such as sunshine hours, are less important for crop yields, although these do affect production in some crops like wheat, rice, cotton and oilseeds..",209,200,0.5126903553299492,7.195952048778874,0.873545816856789,0.05511268010894015,0.88,0.8598843930635832,0.7836201916529687,54.2685664939551,55.33502538071066,50.66069173224521

Indian climate,"Constructions of climate justice in German, Indian and US media","Constructions of climate justice in German, Indian and US media
Abstract
The article explores the ways in which climate injustice is constructed in the German mainstream media and the international press in a comparative perspective. The German and International press coverage of the UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen 2009 is analysed. A discourse network analysis is undertaken to identify discursive constructions of justice and injustices. Findings of an in-depth textual analysis show that climate change is framed in nationalistic discourses. Climate justice is discursively constructed as a moral and political problem of ‘global justice’ and as the need of a “green” global economic transformation. This analysis shows that the construction of injustice depends on a national and local media discourse.

Abstract
ZOOGEOGRAPHIC relationships among species, and the relative effects of Pleisto-cene climatic fluctuations on West India were investigated by comparing zoogeographical data with the distribution of fossil vertebral material from the Pleiocene of the Caribbean. The Caribbean vertebra fauna is dominated by the large herbivores such as the tapirs, the glyptodonts, proboscideans and mastodonders, but it contains a significant proportion of small carnivorous mammals which are absent in modern West Indies. These mammals probably originated in South America. They were not present in the West African zoogeo-graphy during the Oligocene, so that they must have been present during a climatic period that was warmer than now. This warming is suggested to be a response to a northward advance in polar ice. It is argued that the present day distribution patterns of verte-brate fauna may be regarded as a “reaction norm",214,194,0.6352941176470588,8.2832218795516,0.9116656902550473,0.039603825444416735,0.84,0.8627397260273969,0.8243428766419173,88.47236796827355,83.45294117647059,69.66101694915254

Abstract
The Indian monsoons are one of most intense monolithic climate system in the world and the source of water for a huge amount of population. The monologue nature of this climate can be explained as the strong influence of solar insolation and atmospheric dynamics on the regional circulation of monoclonal climate. In order to investigate the role of climate change in future monoclone climate, one needs to have a better understanding of its variability and predictability. To understand the climate variability, the model should be able to produce realistic monocal climate and its associated extreme. However, it is difficult to model the monoclimte accurately due to the complex atmospheric flow, land-atmosphere interactions, and strong coupling of atmospheric and land surface parameters. Therefore, to predict the future climate under climate changes, an understanding and simulation of natural and anthropogenic variability of Indian Summer Monsoon is a must.

Abstract
The equators of the two oceans in Earth's global ocean have been shown to display distinct modes of variability with respect to the tropical Pacific and the Atlantic. It has also been observed that in many parts of these oceans, a similar pattern is found for the equatoria of both oceans. In this paper, we show that a strong equatoriallity in these modes has emerged over tropical Indian oceans during recent years. The Indian equatorium shows the same mode as that of Atlantic Ocean during the 1930s",218,180,0.5870967741935483,7.30929589301274,0.8944039818067703,0.04821005799324369,0.8466666666666667,0.8509923664122133,0.7890015210144654,61.299083550739184,48.70322580645161,51.53789847539848

Abstract
We present a method of relating changes in lightning occurrence over an area with changes of the atmospheric circulation associated with a shift in the monsoon. We apply the method to the period 1960–1993 using daily lightning data from 14 stations over India (and the surrounding seas) and from a 3.5° × 1.6° grid over South Asia and the adjoining seas. The method consists of two components. First, we relate the occurrence of daily maximum lightning intensities [i.e., the maximum value of all occurrences of maximum daily intensifications] over a subregion to changes over this sub region in a parameter of circulation, namely, the circulation parameter that describes the difference in mean circulation in two opposite seasons. Second, based on the result obtained in Step 2, one obtains a relationship between the mean daily circulation ([T] in m s−2) during the season of occurrence for the region,",220,194,0.5,6.855654600401044,0.8676301226137632,0.05820610800129604,0.8285714285714285,0.8207317073170737,0.7636387852115701,43.513353115727,44.47872340425532,40.38544614926262

Abstract. The australian summer monsoon is the dominant rainfall region of the southern hemisphere and is one of most important sources of rainfall for the indian subcontinent. During the last three decades the strength and variability of this monsoonal rainfall system has been significantly reduced and has become more difficult to forecast. In the past, it was suggested, that the reduction in monosonal flow was related to the warming of tropical atlantic water in its southern portion, the ""warm pool"", and the associated increase in surface wind shear. To understand the changes in circulation and rainfall during these periods, a comprehensive set of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (A-OGCMs) and ocean general climate model analyses [from a 3-year hindcast -",221,199,0.5913978494623656,8.065591326174431,0.899484927089366,0.04428927059734041,0.8228571428571428,0.8419753086419759,0.8007233300513277,65.72516168983074,58.96774193548387,50.11538461538461

Abstract
The paper reviews the status of sheep farming in different agro-climatic zones of the country. The study revealed that the area under sheep is more in the northwestern, western and the northeastern part of India. In the present study, the climate of different regions was classified by using the Koppen-Geiger climatic classification system. Climate is one of most important factors influencing the livestock industry and its productivity is very much affected by it. It was found that during the last 30 years the annual temperature of many areas has risen by 3-4°C, which is 0.1-1° C above normal. Rainfall is likely to decrease in north and east but increase in south and west India in 2031 and beyond in all agroclimate zones. During winter the minimum temperature will rise by almost 1.5°-2.25° c and during summer the maximum will increase by about 2°c.

Indian climate,Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities,"Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities
The paper argues that migrants’ participation and inclusion in climate related decision-making are necessary if climate adaptation strategies are to succeed in protecting vulnerable communities and improving urban resilience. This will not be possible unless migrants are recognised as urban residents and their contributions in the face of climate change are formally recognised. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the experiences of and contributions of urban migrants to urban adaptation and climate resilience, particularly in South Asia.
This paper is based on a research project that investigated the contribution of informal migrants and marginal workers to the resilience of low income and informal settlements in three Indian metropolises. We found that informal migrant workers and other marginal groups (such as waste workers, recyclers, street vendors, and small traders) in informal urban settlements are disproportionately impacted by climate induced changes. These groups are also excluded from the formal city governance and urban planning processes. The research suggests that a significant number of migrant households living and working in low-income settlements face extreme vulnerability",223,200,0.5167464114832536,7.470516209753606,0.8764204945436014,0.05326366970745545,0.895,0.8908108108108101,0.7865538910253027,69.66666666666667,66.76076555023923,55.39300273636008

Abstract
A super-high resolution model of the global ocean and atmosphere is used to investigate a possible future Indian summer rainy season in the Indian monsoonal region. A global climate model is forced by the coupled atmospheric model and the ocean component with the Hadley Centre ocean model for a 20-year control simulation and a further 25 years, starting in 2020. The control run represents a climate without any anthropogenic influence. In the future experiment, the model reproduces most of features of current climate including the summer rainfall maximum over South Asia as well as the southwards shift of monolithic summer rain band and its weakening and southward shifting. However, in this future scenario the monolith is replaced with two rain bands. This leads to the weakening of summer precipitation over the western India.",225,187,0.5212121212121212,6.695090919789098,0.8723844230264962,0.05754971859277353,0.8266666666666667,0.834042553191489,0.7729061139624287,50.599999999999994,47.21212121212121,47.388194444444444

Abstract:
The paper examines the impact of climate variability on inter – state internal migrant flows in the Indian subcontinent.

Main Article Content
Abstract
The North-East region of India is highly diverse in nature. It comprises a large number of tribal and indigenous communities which live in the forests and have very limited interaction with the rest of the world. This region is also known in history for its resistance against external invasion which was one of its characteristics. The NorthEast India comprises the states of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. Climate change is a global issue of great concern to the scientific fraternity, policy makers and the general public. There is consensus among the experts that climate change will have a significant impact on the NorthEastern region. India, as a whole is vulnerable to climate variability and extremes. North Eastern states are more vulnerable because of their unique geographic and ecological character and their limited capacity to cope with climate hazards and disasters.

Abstract. Crop models have been used widely to study the impact of climate variability (CV) on crop yield. In this paper, we use a yield gap approach to quantify crop production loss due to variability in precipitation and temperature in Punjab state of India. The impact is studied using the model, the “Crop Yield Gap Model”. This model is a hybrid crop model that is based on the process based crop modelling system ”POWER”. A hybrid model approach was chosen as it combines the advantages of a mechanistic crop growth model and a stochastic crop water model. For the study, daily precipitation data and monthly mean maximum and minimum temperature for the crop seasons in the period 1981 to 2010 were used. We used 2 sets of precipitation ",231,196,0.489247311827957,6.672443733471575,0.8631990389445376,0.060277673852441725,0.8514285714285714,0.8385185185185189,0.7577289625753353,46.667386531995064,52.22043010752688,46.175934696606674

Abstract
The impacts of climate change on human societies have been studied extensively over the last decades. Climate change research has focused mainly on impacts from the direct effects of the changes in the global climate. However, climate changes affect human society in many more ways. These impacts are caused by the complex interplay between changes that occur in nature (such as temperature and precipitation) and changes caused in society, such as changes to agriculture patterns in response to changes of temperature, changes associated with water supply, energy demands and other factors that impact our daily lives. The interactions between these ‘above’and’ ’below’ factors can lead to the amplification and/or attenuation of a given climate signal, resulting in changes above and below what might be observed for a particular climate perturbation. It is this phenomenon that makes the impact of changing climate on our human systems difficult to predict.

The Indian summer monsoon plays a critical role in the climate system of the northern Indian ocean. The monsoons are highly variable over this ocean region, and climate predictions for the coming decades are largely uncertain. In this study, we analyse the seasonal cycle of rainfall, surface temperatures and atmospheric stability, in two high-resolution climate model simulations of summer over an area spanning 20° N–10° S and 30° E–80° W, for two contrasting monsole conditions, wet and dry years. These model runs were carried out under the same climate forcing (the atmospheric general circulation model HadGEM1-ES-L40), which has been used by the IPCC, but at two resolutions, the Hadley Centre’s 1.6 km grid, which is used in many climate studies, compared to their coarser 6.5 km resolution. Both models exhibit a strong summer seasonality",238,191,0.5955056179775281,7.945035903356131,0.8999679451777178,0.04445039357970997,0.8857142857142856,0.8670129870129866,0.8126648119404026,70.71762313104661,70.15168539325843,66.80024968789013

Abstract:This study is conducted to determine the relationship between job satisfaction and organizational stress and climate at the organizational level. Data was gathered through questionnaire from 100 personnel in three different grades from an Indian company. Results indicate that job dissatisfaction is related negatively with organizational commitment and satisfaction. Organizational commitment was found to be an important mediator between occupational stressors and job stress. Occupational stressors are significantly related with job anxiety. It is found that the level of job demand, control and social support are found as the major sources of stress at workplace.

Abstract
The climate profile of a person is the unique combination of the climate factors that are most prevalent at the place of birth of that person. This paper presents the profile, of climate of Indian teachers, based on the meteorological data of 12 weather stations from the 1993 to 2016 time period. The profile is generated from 1 to the maximum of seven different climate variables (temperature, mean relative humidity, maximum daily temperature, minimum daily air temperature and maximum relative temperature). The data for 7,000 teachers across India was used to compute OCA-based climate profiles and to find the most common climate factor for teachers’ location based. We also computed the OBCs using 3 variables: ‘temperature’, “relative humidity’ and ’maximum temperature’.

The Indian subcontinent is a key area in global monsoonal processes. The monolithic South Asian summer monologue is driven by atmospheric circulation and oceanic processes over the western Indian ocean (WIO). Recent observations indicate that the WIO has been changing over recent decades and a substantial warming has occurred. However, it is still poorly understood how the monologues are affected by a warming Wio and how this might lead to changes in the seasonal monolology over Asia. Using the Australian Bureau of Meterology/BoM sea-surface temperature analysis 1958–2004, we investigated the variability of temperature in different regions around the south west monolith and in a north east monogogue.

The Indian sub-continent has one of the world’s most diverse agricultural systems. However, the region’ s agricultural productivity is highly variable, and its climate has been getting drier and warmer during the last century. We examine the impact of climate change using the ‘global climate model’ GFDL CM2.2 coupled with a 3-dimensional climate-vegetation model (CLM4). In our simulations, we have used the output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 – Phase5c (‘CMIP5’). We analyse the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol perturbations in the model, using two different scenarios : “A2”, which is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change 7th Assessment Report ",245,188,0.6242038216560509,7.821251467782697,0.9067928370532866,0.04244600286923451,0.8666666666666667,0.8803007518796989,0.8193066873149303,72.14886731391586,76.86624203821655,64.98087912087912

The aim of this paper is to examine the coverage of the climate crisis in the main newspapers in India. The study aims to identify how and to what extent the newspapers have addressed the issues of global warming and climate breakdown. We have conducted a discourse study of newspaper articles on climate related issues in four newspapers – The Indian Express, Mint, The Hindu and The New Indian express. A total of 60 articles were analyzed using a critical discourse approach to analyze the language used in news stories about climate and environmental issues. This is in contrast to the dominant coverage which has been on mitigation and adaptation measures and other issues related to sustainability.

Abstract
Cotton is one of the major commercial fibers in the textile industry. It is also the most important natural fiber for textile and clothing in China, India, and many other developing countries. Climate change and variability are likely to influence cotton productivity in these regions in future. The objective of this study is to simulate the potential impacts on the production of cotton, based on a global gridded data set of temperature and precipitation, which was developed as part of a previous project. For this purpose, the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the Noah-MP land surface model were used. Results suggest that the area suitable for the cultivation of all three main types of cottons in cotton-producing areas (P. ginseng L., G. arboreum L. and Gossypium barbadense L.) may decrease by 2–3% by the year 2050–2070 due to climate-change-induced temperature rises and associated reductions",248,198,0.572972972972973,7.793274994194362,0.893318243118437,0.047054996119199666,0.8628571428571429,0.853664596273292,0.8044174013658287,66.60733296361309,66.83243243243243,60.008578431372555

In this article we explore whether climate conditions affect wheat crop in the country
The wheat-growing region of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab is likely to get more extreme heat waves as temperatures continue to rise because of global warming and climate changes, a study has said.
According to research by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the region will also experience longer and stronger heatwaves as well as more frequent droughts. This will likely lead to lower wheat yields as heat stress affects plant growth. Wheat accounts for 90 per cent of total cereal production of the three states. It will become even more important in coming years when India will import food grains to fill the supply-demand gap. As a consequence, the cost of food items will go up, especially the staple, wheat. “We found that wheat production in Punjab will be affected by higher temperatures, whereas the wheat growing areas in Hryana",249,196,0.5979381443298969,8.328314639965763,0.9023762689828375,0.042671412360606904,0.9199999999999999,0.9054117647058828,0.8296139083661087,83.67582417582418,85.84536082474227,104.21860809934205

The World Bank estimated the cost of climate change in 2005 for India to be $10-20 billion per year by 2030. The cost is expected to increase to 7-14% of GDP by the end of the 21st century. India is the second most populous nation in the world and the sixth most vulnerable to climate-related impacts. In the last few years, there were 2,500 climate disasters and 3 billion people were affected by them in different ways.

The aim of this study was to explore and analyse climatic and meteorological changes in the Indian sector of the western Indian ocean during 1985-2008. This was in view of developing a long term trend of meteorology. A total of 12 stations in south east Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar and Mauritius were used. The 10 selected stations showed similar trends for the 30 years period. There was a decrease in annual average rainfall at 6 stations. On the other hand at the remaining 5 stations there was either no change or an increase in rainfall, with the highest being at Maputo, the capital of Mozambique (0.4 mm to 2 mm p.a). The decrease ranged from 0 mm in Maputa to over 100",251,197,0.5932203389830508,7.892283294029704,0.8991162525438291,0.04487764555111658,0.8628571428571429,0.8478431372549016,0.8095252517391976,64.08022208240743,65.28248587570621,55.385286873370035
Indian climate,The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change,"The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change. We used a model of the global dispersal of mammals to estimate the impact of climate warming on the spread of this species. Our results show that the species is unlikely to expand outside its range unless the climate warms by at least 2.3oC. Climate warming beyond these values would cause the mongose to reach areas with suitable temperature but the lack of suitable prey would limit its expansion further. This is the first time a species has been assessed for its climate suitability by combining global climate and prey species distribution data. The results suggest that climate is a better predictor of range expansion than prey availability in this invasive species, a finding that highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in the assessment of global change impact.
Introduction
The global distribution of species and the processes that control the extent of their range are key questions to address in order to understand the potential impact that global warming might have on species",252,180,0.5240641711229946,7.16646975644588,0.8764810319361075,0.05436953338142331,0.8742857142857143,0.8549693251533749,0.7716906913371716,59.022771248707066,54.83422459893048,54.23412624953721

As a child, I would spend my summer vacations in India, mostly with my maternal grandparents who lived in a village in West Bengal close to the Sundarban mangroves.
One morning I remember waking up to see a strange sight. A man was climbing a tree right outside the window, a small boat in tow and a long pole in his grip. My grandpa explained that it was a local fisherman who was out fishing. But, there was something strange about it. The fisherman was wearing a blue shirt with a white patch on his left shoulder, an Indian army uniform. I wondered why he would be up a big old tree in our compound, especially when the man in white was in full combat gear. He was not alone. Another man stood behind him, holding onto his rifle and peering over his shoulder to make sure the fisherman wasn’t going to fall down. And then a third one",262,187,0.5824742268041238,8.112927192380441,0.8974022602675605,0.044845555622325936,0.8971428571428571,0.875058823529411,0.8006564894271128,69.79688175305986,73.83505154639175,68.86229671423831

Abstract
The western and central Indian ocean coral reefs have been identified as one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change. However, information on the extent of species diversity and their response to environmental changes is currently lacking. We used the species richness of reef-building corals to estimate the diversity of coral communities. This was done by applying the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’) to 11 000 coral samples collected at 10 locations between 15°N and 25°S along the Indian east coast.

1. Introduction
The Indian ocean is a large (3.5×106 km2) semi-enclosed basin - with a narrow outlet – and is the largest ocean in area. It is also characterized by high latitudinal (~20°) and longitudinal (<10∘) gradients of the wind, temperature, salinity and depth which influence the ocean circulation. The mean wind stress curl is about three times larger than the mean wave energy flux [1]. The Indian monsoon is associated with an east-west dipole mode and a north-south asymmetry of about 2∕1 and 3∕�1 respectively. A number of studies have shown that the interannual to decadel variability of Indian summer monsoons is related to the ENSO, and that ERSO ",265,196,0.6,7.823042886243178,0.90053627882262,0.044593588413545826,0.8733333333333332,0.8684931506849314,0.8124445223510675,67.02508960573476,71.47647058823529,68.79391371340523

Abstract. The seasonal climate forecasts of the Nucleus for European Prediction (NCEPs) climate system are based on an extended version of its latest coupled atmosphere–ocean system, called version 2b, which includes a 20–90 day seasonal forecasting system. This forecasting model has been validated using a hindcasting period from 1960 to 2005 with respect to the observed precipitation and temperature. We examine in this study the performance of N2B for the seasonal Indian monsoons – the onset and the peak rainfall — using the latest hindcasts 1981–2010. It is found that Ncep's seasonal monsole forecasts have improved over the last 40 years.

This study examines how Indian commercial banks are responding to the risk of climate-related financial losses due to their exposure to energy and other infrastructure sectors that have a direct impact on the climate. It is found that most banks have yet to take any action to manage climate related risks to any material extent. However, this is likely to change rapidly as banks recognise the material impact of the risks and the growing expectations of stakeholders and regulators. The results also suggest that the Indian government should consider taking steps to incentivise banks in managing climate risks.

Indian climate,Climate models produce skillful predictions of Indian summer monsoon rainfall,"Climate models produce skillful predictions of Indian summer monsoon rainfall, but they fail to capture the extreme wet years, such as 2010.
The authors propose a possible way to improve model predictions: by considering the effect of a changing climate on the atmospheric circulation of the Indian monsoons. By adding more heat energy into the atmosphere, a warming planet would tend to intensify the circulation around the pole and weaken it at the equator, where the monosons blow into land masses (in the southern hemisphere, of course). This would cause a stronger poleward flow that would lead to a more intense Indian Monsoon during warm periods and a weaker polewards flow in cold periods, with less rainfall and fewer monson events. The authors tested this hypothesis with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model with and without this effect: the model without the extra heat showed the “normal” monsson patterns. But with the addition of extra energy the climate became more variable, and the",270,189,0.5519125683060109,7.466134836641186,0.8859070513747359,0.050428912758886765,0.857142857142857,0.8638993710691822,0.7944093416859683,60.79391891891892,65.22404371584699,67.53350248267583

This increase may be due to urbanization and industrialization, as well as the increasing anthropogenic activity. It is also found that rainfall has decreased during this period. Rainfall has declined by about 10 % from the 1950s to the late 1980's in this region.",271,192,0.592,6.618761213399377,0.8914220010087742,0.05177999929308776,0.8320000000000001,0.8728712871287135,0.7946193480741153,57.957848837209305,60.632,54.902872777017784

Indian forests are highly diverse in their composition and distribution, and the dynamic nature of the vegetation and its response to a changing climate presents a major challenge to the forestry community. Understanding how forests respond and adapt to different environmental conditions is a crucial aspect of conservation and sustainable use of forests. The objective of this study is to evaluate the suitability of forest dynamics models to predict how the forests would respond to changes in climatic variables over the Indian region using observed data. We developed and validated a dynamic forest model using a set of 14 dynamic and structural parameters. Our analysis revealed that the performance of all the models improved when the model parameters were updated with new and improved data, especially when data of recent decades",272,200,0.5631578947368421,7.762595876177125,0.8905674474136437,0.04802298613619242,0.8628571428571429,0.8383132530120492,0.7994250505514163,56.790633608815426,61.189473684210526,55.408578196379224

Abstract/Description
The Himalayan region has been facing a plethora of natural hazards like floods, landslides and snow avalanches since centuries due to its fragile environment, which has also increased vulnerability and exposure of vulnerable communities. This is further accentuated by the climate variability and change. The present study, using the Climate Vectors Index (CVI), measures the vulnerability levels of Himalayan communities to climate volatility. CVI has five indicators, namely, the ‘temperature index’, 'precipitation",273,195,0.5891891891891892,8.013839380822503,0.8986643898280164,0.04469692741068358,0.8457142857142858,0.8578881987577637,0.7962140110429281,55.73717948717949,50.962162162162166,63.45726495726496

Abstract. The Indian ocean dipole (IOD) is a natural, long-lived mode of variability in the coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation of a region extending from the Bay of Bengal in South-East Asia through the Western Pacific to the East Coast of Africa. In the past, it has been identified as an important climate driver, with impacts on the interannual climate variability and extreme weather events in both the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere.
In the present study, the IOD is studied with a high-resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean model for 1950–2015. We find that a large part of model variability (~ 75 %) occurs in one of two distinct patterns, in which the maximum is located off the western coast of Australia",275,189,0.5879120879120879,7.931367688273783,0.8979290603269261,0.04516270601703134,0.8628571428571429,0.8572151898734166,0.7859009423098271,69.84206761056654,67.48351648351648,61.33053441791306

Abstract
Emerging Arbovirus Diseases (EADs): Aedes albopictus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Zika are considered to pose a growing risk to human and animal health worldwide. The increasing number of people moving between regions carrying the pathogens that cause them is likely to increase the spread. Climate change is a major determinant of the transmission of these diseases. This review aims at identifying and assessing the impact of various factors including climate on EADs. A search of peer-reviewed publications from 1964-2013 was undertaken in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation databases using the following key words: climate, vector, arboviruses, disease, dengue, chikengunia. We also searched the literature for the impacts of temperature on mosquito vectors in order to assess the influence of changing climate.

Abstract
The δ14 C, 210Pb, and the 137Cs ages of Indian sedimentary rocks are commonly used in paleoclimate reconstructions. These ages are interpreted from magnetic and density-sedimentation proxies, as they provide information about the sea level, sea temperature, productivity, etc. The δ13 C isotopic ratio of these rocks is also used for this purpose. In particular, the δ 13C values from Indian sediment cores and sedimentalites are often used as a climate reconstruction tool. However, there has been little work done on these proxies in order to understand how they are formed. This study presents a detailed investigation of sediment composition, δC and δD of sedimnetialites, their isotope fractionation patterns, sedimentation rates and sediment flux in the western Indian basin.

Abstract
The study focuses on the wave climate along 11 sites along Tamil-Nadu coast of India for the period 2002–2010. Wave data are used in conjunction with the 3-dimensional (3D) wind fields from the National Data Buoy Center buoy 42002 to compute wave height and significant wave heights. The wave data from 4 sites are analysed for different seasons. A wave energy analysis is undertaken for 6 sites in the study to find out the maximum and annual averages of wave power generated. These 2 methods are found to give different results. For example at Kanyakumari, the values obtained by using wave analysis are about 1.7 times that obtained from wave measurements. This is due to the presence of",278,193,0.6049382716049383,7.699607172920184,0.9012050439062883,0.044713412420128856,0.8866666666666667,0.8713043478260867,0.8019392221348794,56.91330858960764,63.18518518518518,55.07845794392523
Indian climate,Climate change contributes to more frequent consecutive positive Indian Ocean Dipole events,"Climate change contributes to more frequent consecutive positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, which cause heavy rains and floods in Southeast Asia
A new study published in Geophysical Research Letters has found that human-induced climate change has contributed to a trend increase in consecutive negative Indian Dipolar events (IDPs) — a period of alternating positive and negative dipolar regions of the Indian and Pacific Ocean. Researchers found a strong correlation between the IDPs and the frequency and intensity of consecutive extreme rainy seasons in the Southeast Asian region since the 1990s.
Consecutive negative IDP events are linked to extreme rainfall and flooding in this region as they increase the probability of a second extreme IDM following consecutive dry years. These second negative events often occur with a lag of several months, but are often larger than the first ones.. As the region experiences an increased probability for a wet year following a dry period, the number of extreme events is likely to increase. The researchers found",279,183,0.5642458100558659,7.549094436794552,0.8896813712303504,0.0489684090584754,0.9199999999999999,0.9068387096774181,0.8146590904558716,69.37799142083082,74.54748603351955,65.16741182314954

Abstract. The seasonal cycle and interannual variability of rainfall over East Asia and India have important impacts on the monsoon rainfall and circulation over the western Pacific Ocean. A monoslope and multidomain regional ocean–atmosphere modelling experiment is performed to study how monolithic and monomodel responses to changes in sea-level pressure, temperature, and precipitation in East and Western Pacific are altered through the inclusion of a topographic uplift in the Himalayas. Two different versions are used, where the topography of the Tibetan Plateau is either modelled by using the ""topography-only"" approach or by including the effects of topographical uplift on sea level through a dynamic topogra- phy (DT). The DT is found to reduce the mean rainfall in summer over China and the Korean",280,181,0.5882352941176471,7.669649888473704,0.8966804757690342,0.04632230007182633,0.8999999999999999,0.8723287671232881,0.815649674349008,78.56060606060606,74.23529411764706,65.21052631578948

Abstract
The relationship between past and present sea surface temperatures and sea level rise (SLR) and their impact on coral reefs were investigated using coral growth rates [1, 2] and coral bleaching ([1], 3) from 10 coral reef monitoring sites around the Indian ocean. The 20th century SSTs and SLR were obtained from NOAA data and were compared with coral data collected between 1981 and 1997. A 1.0 °C warming and a 4 cm SL rise are estimated for the 21st century. These predicted SL rises are similar in magnitude to historical coral cover declines observed in 1961 (-2.9%),1966 -(2%), and in recent decades.
Corals at sites with high coral loss (>50%) experienced the highest SSTA. In sites where coral losses were low (<30%) the SSTE showed little correlation with the",281,199,0.5668449197860963,7.751487695747585,0.8914819851162156,0.04776654084138547,0.8514285714285714,0.8498159509202451,0.8127008235212582,45.34862110311751,52.99465240641711,53.96762141967621

The impact of the climate and the associated sea-level rise is being witnessed throughout the world, even in low-lying countries. The Indian coastline is also no exception. It is well documented that the Indian coastal areas have been witnessing the negative effects of global warming and climate changes over the last few decades. Sea-water temperature has increased and is projected to increase further in future. As a consequence, the intensity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, heatwave, monsoon and drought are projected (IPCC, IPCC Special Report on Managing of Global Warming, SRREN/IPPC, 2011).",284,197,0.6055555555555555,8.124380318249235,0.903405904754422,0.04283034313015466,0.8457142857142858,0.8274358974358972,0.8088340386914263,63.50117479728647,62.73888888888889,46.32030710835059

Abstract. The Indian mon-soon system is highly sensitive to small-scale atmospheric perturbations and the associated large- scale atmospheric circulations. A significant fraction of the mon–soon rainfall and circulation variability can be attributed to internal variability in the atmosphere. However, the extent of internal and external variability is not understood well yet.
In order to assess the relative contributions of these internal/external forcings in driving the regional/global climate system, it is essential to study the role of both the external as well as the internal components. In the current study we have performed an intercomparison of 12 regional atmosphere model simulations of Indian summer climate and their impacts on the winter Indian Monsoon using an atmospheric General Circulation Model.

The Tibetan plateau is considered a major driver of regional climate on a global scale. The Tibetan and Asian monsoons, the latter of which is driven by a complex interplay between the westerly monoswell and summer monocyclone, both of whose impacts are modulated by the summer Asian high, have been linked to monolithic Tibetan glaciation events, most notably those at the Last Glacial Maximum (~23–18 ka cal BP) and Holocene. However, it remains an open question as to how and to what extend the monoscale and synoptic processes are coupled, a question particularly pertinent to the Asian summer.

Climate change will affect agriculture worldwide, with significant implications for food security, rural livelihoods and biodiversity, especially if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. The livestock sector is a major driver for change and a key area for intervention. There are many pathways by which livestock production impacts climate: through emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the digestive system, through the use of land and water resources, and through land-use change.
Livestock production has been shown to contribute to climate impacts through:
- GHG emissions;

Abstract. The Indian Bengal Delta is a densely populated delta region which is highly vulnerable to flooding due to its low geographical position, high precipitation and tidal range.

We apply the PRECIS model to evaluate the simulated climatology of monsoonal rainfall over South Asia. This includes both the mean climatological conditions and the variability in precipitation. To evaluate and assess the impact of the model's representation on its ability to reproduce the climatologies of seasonal monosonal precipitation, we apply PREGIS-Mon, a monograph by Kummerow et al. [2008, hereafter K08] to the observed precipitation from a large number of stations across South and Southeast Asia during 1971–2000 for validation, and a subset of 50 stations to assess model biases. The validation results indicate that the simulations of PRECG-SST are reasonably good over land and sea.
The simulations for the entire Indian region are evaluated for mean seasonal climatologists.

The present study investigates the impact of projected future change in climate in South Asia, with a focus on South and Southeast Asia and the Bay of Bengal, on the onset and retreat of Indian monsoons through an assessment of a regional atmospheric climate and hydrological model (WRFv3-India-IH) under the A2-B2 scenario of Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change 2030-2060 emission scenarios. Using the 2000 to 2013 climatological analysis period, a seasonal cycle of precipitation is simulated and found to be in good agreement with observations for the two monolithic regions of South, and South East Asia. The seasonal analysis of 1.25° × 2.5° grid box in each region showed a robust seasonal variation of both precipitation and temperature over the monoliths of India (>",293,191,0.5568181818181818,7.387027942155209,0.8867578901840775,0.05043040346156488,0.8857142857142858,0.8571052631578946,0.7959261543036452,54.44809532406572,61.05681818181818,57.55826271186441

Abstract. We investigated the relationship between climate extremes, such as high-impact weather and the summer monsoon, and climate variability in summer of 2022. In summer, extreme weather conditions such high temperatures and high precipitation often accompany each other. For example, in 1996, a strong high pressure area formed over East Asia and caused the record-breaking heat over Korea and Japan. During the heat-wave event from June to July in this year, high temperature was observed in East Asian countries. A high rainfall event was also observed over Japan during the same period.

Description
This paper examines the relationship between the climate and the imperial landscape and examines how these are intertwined in the construction of British colonial hill stations in Northeast India. It focuses on how colonial administrators in colonial India created and shaped the image of an ideal mountain environment for the consumption of European tourists in order to enhance the appeal of their hill resorts for visitors. Using colonial photographs as visual documents, the paper demonstrates how the “picturesque” was constructed to appeal to the senses",297,195,0.581151832460733,8.03167811874588,0.89666508528743,0.0453017988234222,0.8057142857142857,0.8009580838323351,0.7804072726985801,45.42394397925321,43.42931937172775,37.89097515236756

Abstract
The Indian State of Gujarat is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and variability, owing to its coastal and deltaic nature and its high population density and agricultural dependence. As a result, Gujarat’s population is highly dependent on natural resources, especially on the state’ s water resources and on agriculture. This study assesses the adaptation strategies of a smallholder farming community in the coastal district of Saurashtra, which are currently being employed to respond to and reduce their vulnerability to a changing climate. Using an integrated social-ecological system perspective, the study examines the adaptive capacity of the community to reduce the vulnerability of smallscale farmers through changes in their livelihoods and in natural resource use. The community is engaged in multiple livelihoods, including farming, fishing, livestock raising, and forest-based activities. Their adaptation responses fall under four broad categories.

Abstract
This book is an outcome of a collaborative effort among experts on climate and inland fishes of the Ganges Basin. The objective of this book was to review the status of freshwater fisheries of river Gange in the face of changing climate; review impact studies in relation to climate variables on freshwater fishes; understand the current state of knowledge regarding impacts of various climate-driven variables; identify gaps in current knowledge; and make recommendations for future research. We have also reviewed the available models, models in development, and model applications, to assess how well they address the needs of inland fishery management. Climate-related changes have had profound effects on the distribution and diversity of fishes & their habitats in many regions of India, including the Gangetic Plains (Chowdhury et al., 2007).

Abstract
This paper investigates the role of El Niño (EN) and the Indian-summer monsoon on the North American summer monsoonal circulation using the Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean–Atmosphere–Land System 1/4 degree climate prediction system. The model was run with and without ENSO and Iod. In addition, the IDA model with ESDM forcing was used as controls. A strong IDO is found to be a necessary component for summer rainfall in the US Midwest and central United States. This summer IENO-driven circulation is characterized by the northward displacement of low pressure systems and westward intensification of high pressure. It also results in more northwesterly winds and stronger southward winds in mid-latitudes than the control run. However, a weak EEN + IES circulation pattern can be identified in July 2015 in our model.

Abstract:The paper examines the effects of investment and other factors on manufacturing labour productivity using panel and panel-econometric methods, based on data collected for the 1992-1993 period. We estimate the effect of manufacturing investment using the method of least squares and the instrumental variable methods. The panel data method estimates an aggregate production function for manufacturing. Our results show that investment has a significant effect on productivity for Indian manufacturing firms. This implies that there is room for investment to increase productivity of the manufacturing sector in India, provided the government and local authorities do their part to encourage investment in this sector.

Abstract
This research aims to evaluate the hydrological response of a large urban drainage basin in the Indian city, Thiraunanthapurm, under various climate change scenarios. The drainage system of the Thriunathanthpuram consists of 12 sub-basins and a main channel. These subchannels are linked to a stormwater pumping system, which pumps out the water from the basin to the sea. A 4D-2Q2C model is used to perform hydrologic analysis of subbasin level. This model was calibrated by using the observed discharge data for 2006 to 2015, and validated against observed discharges and streamflow for the period 1993–2005. To simulate the future discharge, 20th -century CMIP5 climate simulations were used. Three climate downscaling techniques were adopted.

Indian climate,European climate leadership in question: policies toward China and India,"European climate leadership in question: policies toward China and India
The European Union has long been an environmental policy role model. But now China, which will likely become the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter within a few years, is making rapid strides to catch up. And in India, where energy use is skyrocketing, emissions growth is also a serious problem. The question for Europe’S environmental leadership is how to deal with the two biggest emitting developing countries.
A paper for the European Commission by Ecologic Institute and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) argues that Europe could be a powerful force in addressing the climate change challenges in these countries, but that it needs to take a new approach. “Europe cannot be just a bystander and should use its influence to shape climate policy,” says SWP researcher and paper author Dr. Ulrich Körner. Krünner argues in the paper that a ‘business-as-usual’ approach to emissions reductions would mean that the EU",309,198,0.6073298429319371,8.39346542139209,0.9050538316841341,0.04162419089486051,0.9485714285714285,0.919281437125749,0.8405590485555912,84.99780058651027,93.57591623036649,87.6592731829574

Abstract
This dissertation aims at identifying and understanding farmer's perceptions on climate-change and its impacts and strategies for adaptation in a freshwater ecosystem. Farmers' responses were studied in two contrasting climatic regions, namely the Sundarbans mangrove-marsh region of Bangladesh and Manú River system of Peru. The Sundara-ban region experiences the adverse impacts of both sea-level rise and salinity intrusion. While the Maná region is threatened by both climate extremes and climate variability. In both cases, there has been observed significant changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. Climate-driven changes and extreme events like droughts and floods have impacted on farming systems and livelihoods. Adaptation strategies have varied in both regions.",310,187,0.5363128491620112,7.175376890418584,0.879893719554962,0.05331296750982329,0.8628571428571429,0.860129032258065,0.7884826973680076,60.55112124667427,62.815642458100555,62.457797220792585
Indian climate,Fluctuations in all-India summer monsoon rainfall during 18711978,"Fluctuations in all-India summer monsoon rainfall during 18711978: a review
Abstract
The variability and extremes in rainfall are of interest to researchers in various disciplines and fields of studies. Rainfall is an important climatic phenomenon, especially in a semi-arid region as India, where its variability has a significant impact on agricultural production, socio-economic activities, energy generation, water supply and availability of drinking water and so on. The review is aimed at providing a brief overview of the summer season rainfall variations at various sites across India over the past two centuries based on published and unpublished sources of data. A detailed analysis on the inter-annual variability of precipitation has been done for 16 stations across the country. It has also been found that summer rainfall is highly variable and exhibits a wide spread of variability in different parts of India during the period (1871-78). It is also observed that the maximum rainfall variability occurs between 1920 to 1950, while the minimum occurred between the years 193",311,191,0.578125,8.010734985006058,0.8957744834867823,0.045646853425641336,0.9028571428571428,0.8949999999999999,0.8124922327793742,73.30959136709936,72.3125,74.93060869565218

Abstract
The monthly pan evaporation (MPE) over the central Indian Himalaya was estimated over a period of twelve years 2005–16 and compared with four different models: 1) the Penman-Monteith model 2) The Priestley-Taylor model, 3) Thornthwaite “C” method and 4) Penalosa & Rojas model. Daily MPEs were estimated from 15 weather data sites using the four models. The results of the monthly MPA were compared and evaluated by using coefficient of determination [r2] and mean absolute percentage error [%MAPE] for different seasons as well as for all seasons. Results indicated the Thornton Taylor ‘C’ model performed best with respect to MPe estimation.",312,180,0.6095890410958904,7.365692408561075,0.9006803125631683,0.04588886103825005,0.8320000000000001,0.8540983606557377,0.8300554495549137,67.79876302684727,70.46575342465754,61.65861344537815

In the Indian Himalayas, water resources are very much dependent on the monsoon, which is influenced by global warming. The Teesto River is a tributary of river Ganga and originates in the Himalaya region near Gangotri Glacier with the elevation of 3,600 m and flows down towards the Gangetic Plains. A comprehensive study was done to investigate the impact of global change over the water balance and hydrological regime of Teest River Basin for two different time periods from 1901 to 2005 and 1986 to1995.

Abstract –
Indian subcontinent is highly vulnerable to climate change with its tropical climate and large monsoonal precipitation. This paper examines the temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events in last century using instrumental and historical records in a number of stations in southern part of India and shows its sensitivity and vulnerability. The results show the mean and median of monthly and annual temperatures are increasing in most of the stations. Mean temperatures have increased up to 0.5 to1.6 °C in 1911 to present in Southern Peninsular India. Precipitation has also increased in all the southern stations and also in north India stations, which shows a trend towards more frequent heavy precipitation events.

Abstract: The authors of this paper attempt to simulate the impact on the wheat crop of climate scenarios for the next 30 years, with an emphasis on temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. They also attempt an assessment of the crop response to climate changes using the FAO-60 model. Their findings indicate that, if climate conditions continue to be as projected, wheat production in 2000 will be 10–15% lower than it was in the 1990s. However, there is little difference between their findings and other analyses of impacts of future climate on global wheat yields.

In the context of emerging variability and climate change, this project investigates how to ensure that agriculture remains sustainable in the face of changing climatic conditions. To this end three questions are addressed:
- What is the state of agricultural sustainability in a changing climate in different parts of India and what are the key factors affecting it?
The study is conducted on two sites with contrasting climatic and socioeconomic conditions in northern and southern India. Climate-related risks (such as droughts, floods, frost, pest attacks) are assessed using climate data and historical observations, and the impact of these events on agricultural production are quantified.
A survey of local experts is carried out to investigate the adaptation strategies employed by Indian farmers and to gain further insights into how climate impacts affect farmers’ livelihoods. Furthermore, climate information and risk management tools are developed for farmers in cooperation with local research institutes.",319,195,0.5602094240837696,7.742248276628912,0.8896773746601717,0.048365195759035494,0.8857142857142858,0.8934131736526927,0.8093372581946343,68.32104823797431,78.90575916230367,73.1825912183055

The data is analysed using 2-dimensional spectral and wavelet analysis techniques. A significant increase of wave heights and frequencies is observed in all these regions. In general, significant variability is found for wind and wind-wave climate parameters, such as wave height and period, wind speed at 50,60 and 70 m height, and their corresponding spectral parameters - wave steepness, wave periodicity and significant wave amplitude for all three regions in both hemispheres. However, there are differences in variability of wind, temperature and salinity for the three areas.

Background
A significant part of climate change impact and mitigation efforts depend on the understanding of changes in Ocean, Sea-surface Temperature, ocean heat content, sea level, salinity etc. The Indian and Western coasts of Africa are particularly vulnerable to climate changes due to its proximity to Indian/Western Oceans. This vulnerability has been recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes. A sustained Ocean observing System can be used to help understand climate variations. Ocean observation and monitoring are essential for a sustainable development, particularly for coastal regions. Such a system will have to be designed and developed",324,183,0.5608465608465608,7.710365455005064,0.889672676058939,0.048464386153462956,0.9142857142857143,0.8913939393939387,0.8098993555229388,83.03155339805825,76.14814814814815,78.50964912280702
Indian climate,Assessment on vulnerability of sorghum to climate change in India,"Assessment on vulnerability of sorghum to climate change in India with special reference to heatwaves
Sorghums is a staple crop of millions of farmers in Indian semi-arid tropics (SAT) where they are cultivated in rotation with rice and wheat. The crop has the potential to contribute to the livelihoods and food security of the region. However, the crop productivity, which is dependent on the weather condition, is highly susceptible to adverse weather events such as heat stress. Heat waves are projected to increase significantly in number, frequency, and intensity in the coming decades. To assess the vulnerability, we developed a crop model “SVM” to forecast crop yield for sorhums. In SVM, crop water productivity (%CPW) was the most sensitive parameter to temperature. Increasing heat wave temperature had significant effect on sorgum grain yield in all the 16 locations. SOMs analysis revealed that sorgo was more vulnerable to extreme heat waves,",325,184,0.5828571428571429,7.710475249388236,0.8954819883409099,0.04659662894274325,0.88,0.8529801324503304,0.7900335562028439,60.50018628084424,61.86857142857143,45.138817273606186

Abstract. A numerical model is used to investigate the impact of the increasing temperature on the occurrence of tropical-cyclones (TCs) along the Indian Coasts. The study focuses on a 10-member 40 year 20th Century reanalysis data set from the NOAA/National Climate Data Center. This data was supplemented with the latest available satellite sea surface temperature data of 2013 from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, United States.
Results indicate that the frequency of TCs has shown a gradual decrease, which was attributed to the increase in wind shear and decrease in sea-surface temperature. It is observed that TC occurrence is reduced due to increasing frequency in the formation of easterly waves. These eastery waves are formed in response to increased heat and moisture in",326,196,0.5824175824175825,7.857242756607673,0.896124731294614,0.04596105647706733,0.8857142857142858,0.8926582278481003,0.8181024281337784,65.62685020108628,73.82967032967034,79.26992753623188

Abstract.
The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a natural oscillating pattern of the Atlantic Ocean. It is the strongest atmospheric pattern in Africa that is associated with large-scale climate variations such as the African monsoons. NAO is also a dominant pattern over Asia and Europe and thus has strong impacts on global climates, including the East Asian summer monograph. However, its impacts of African climate have been scarcely investigated. To investigate the role of NAOs in the monosomonal climate system of Africa, a comprehensive statistical analysis based on the 30 years 1972–2001 of monthly mean atmospheric circulation and precipitation data, as well as of surface air temperature [0–2 km] and sea level pressure data (< 300 hPa) was conducted for 11 stations over the continent.

Abstract. The tropical Pacific Ocean, especially the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean and the Bay of Bengal, is of great importance to climate research because it contributes significantly to the Earth's atmospheric circulation. In a recent study, we investigated the impact of using high-resolution regional model output in a low-order dynamical downscaling model (LODsDM) as a source term for the generation of cyclones for a climate experiment of the South Indian monsoon. We found that regional models with a spatial resolution of about 10° latitude × 7.5° longitude are able to reproduce features of a synoptic cyclonic circulation that are of importance for this climate. However, in terms of their representation of vorticities in these cyclons they are not able, or only partially able in some simulations, to",328,195,0.5752688172043011,7.845620653642402,0.8941935241460117,0.04662078536434592,0.8514285714285714,0.8570370370370374,0.7976576501172232,66.11876722377525,57.715053763440864,57.5974944182585
Indian climate,Climatic zones and rural housing in India,"Climatic zones and rural housing in India: implications for rural poverty reduction strategies
This paper examines the relationship between climatic zones, rural household poverty and the type of housing. It uses a nationally representative data set on households from India's Rural Household Survey (RHS). The empirical results indicate that households residing in the tropical zone are poorer and have lower access to sanitation, education and improved health facilities as compared to households in other climatic regions. However, the results of the multinomial logit analysis show that the association between the climatic zone and poverty depends, to a large extent, on the nature of household housing - i.e. whether the household is urban'slum' dwelling or rural dwelling. The results suggest that rural ""non-slums"" and slums are the poorest, and urban dwelling is the richest. A policy recommendation from the paper is that to reduce rural and, in particular, slum-related poverty, housing improvement, especially in non-",329,191,0.5138121546961326,6.912635560098647,0.8719057577396702,0.05673714747802482,0.8628571428571428,0.865732484076434,0.7627155805726682,57.12411347517731,54.552486187845304,53.89901004728132

Abstract
Climate change is predicted to cause significant health impacts in the future, with India being particularly vulnerable to these impacts due to its high population, high poverty, poor health infrastructure, and dependence on agriculture, fisheries, forestry, etc. The objective of this study was to review literature on the current evidence of the impacts of global warming in health of people in developing countries. A literature search was conducted using PubMed. Studies with the key word ‘climate change’ were included. We also included reviews of impact of different climate related events that had occurred in past. Most studies on climate-related impacts on human health had been carried out in temperate regions. These studies indicated that climate variability and climate extremes have the potential to affect the burden of several communicable and non-communicable diseases. It was found that the health burden due climate variations is likely to be greater among the vulnerable people, the poor, elderly and women. There were also reports of changes in some non communiable",331,197,0.48292682926829267,6.914459928118824,0.8632559150073892,0.05915166285486864,0.825,0.8265193370165752,0.7641249814268519,46.004225525188374,44.47317073170732,42.78030814215025

Abstract
The western and central Indian Oceans support a substantial longline fishery for yellow-fin and alb-fished tuna, but the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation [ENSO] on this fisher- ies distribution are largely unknown. We used data from a time-series of fisher surveys to examine the relation of ENSO to tuna distribution, and to explore the relationship between tuna biomass and E NSO. EN-SO was defined as the difference between the SSTs for January, April and July, 1998-2008. A generalized linear model - a type II-model – was fitted to a count of tuna sightings, using generalized additive models {GAM) and Bayesian inference. The GAM model showed strong evidence that E 1",332,200,0.6075268817204301,8.285561998706461,0.9046339430290931,0.04202049484400296,0.8857142857142858,0.8822222222222221,0.8204731240511931,74.70355613532598,73.5,69.69015525758644

Indian climate,Extreme heat in India and anthropogenic climate change,"Extreme heat in India and anthropogenic climate change are linked
In India, the heat wave that began in early April 2016, resulted in over 2,000 deaths and was associated with a number of heatstroke cases. As the death toll increased with the passage of time, media coverage of the disaster increased and it became clear that the deaths were largely attributable to the effects of extreme heat and not of any other cause. A heatwave, which is a period of unusually high temperatures, has been associated in some studies with mortality, but the causal relationship is not fully understood. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the national weather forecasting agency has now published an analysis of a heat-death cluster that occurred during a 10-day period in mid-April 2106. This heat cluster was found to have been linked to climate and the IMD has also linked the cluster to extreme climate.

Abstract
A multicomponent, multiscale approach has been proposed for ranking climate change models. The approach involves using 10 climate parameters for evaluating the model performance. In the present study of climate modelling for the country India, the ranking is done for a set of 16 global and regional climate model runs from a pool of over 40 models using the “Multiscenario Approach to Climate Change (MASCC)” developed by the World Climate Research Programme. For the India study, a 100-year time window from 1961 to 2100 has chosen for climate projections. Using this method, we have ranked the models in descending order with respect to different performance measures. It shows that the performance of the Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (“SST”) and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (""AMOC”) have been assessed to be very poor and their scores are the",335,182,0.5459770114942529,7.201931413999582,0.882695886646897,0.05235507027708387,0.8533333333333334,0.8578666666666667,0.7841143260654575,57.51828008265777,60.62068965517241,59.59750288129082

Abstract
We reconstruct past changes of summer climate (June–August) over 0.5 degrees of longitude and 30 degrees in longitudes 50–70 degrees N latitude during 70–0 kyr using the stable isotope composition and oxygen composition of a sediment core from the North Atlantic. We demonstrate that the intensity of the summer rainfall over the north-eastern Eurasia and the Arctic Ocean is controlled by climate change on the Asian continent and that this climatic signal is well preserved in sediment isotopes, which are also influenced by regional climate processes. In the last 40 k years, the monsoonal precipitation in north eastern Asia and in Arctic increased during summer, while it decreased in Eurasian high-latitude areas. The decrease of monosonal summer precipitation over Eurasians high latitudes was probably caused by increasing arctic sea ice. This change in mononso",337,182,0.563953488372093,7.396180661131327,0.8887257672853978,0.04977535976718621,0.86,0.8643243243243242,0.8040693514020254,64.22770855765779,66.29651162790698,68.45977011494253

Abstract
The paper studies the extent of passive adaptation among rural farmers in India. The passive adaptive capacity among the Indian rural populations has been found to be relatively higher than the global average. However the passive capacity is found relatively low among those in the rural poor and vulnerable group. This implies that the vulnerable populations may face more severe impacts of climate shocks due to their relatively less ability to deal with climate variability. It is observed that rural households which are vulnerable, are more passive in their coping and adaptation strategies and the coping ability declines with increasing vulnerability. A higher passive coping capacity of Indian poor is attributed to greater household savings and access to social safety net.",338,200,0.5034013605442177,6.103417131433186,0.8624633272488291,0.06345940695719646,0.8480000000000001,0.8452032520325207,0.7556789279511599,45.826424870466326,46.156462585034014,43.67280564263323

Abstract
Understanding and predicting the effects of climate and land‑use changes on hydrology is of increasing importance in water resources management. The use of Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) has emerged as a powerful approach for simulating complex interactions between multiple interacting agents to understand the impact of changes in the environment on the dynamics of hydrological systems. In this study, an ABM framework was developed to simulate the hydrologic and hydroclimatic dynamics in a catchments in India. It incorporated the interactions of water, land use and vegetation types. This study also included climate forcing based on observed and projected precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 - Coupling, version 4 1.0 2 [CMP5-C4.1] simulations.

Abstract
The Indian ocean dipoles (IODs) are a key mode of variability in the coupled ocean–atmosphere climate system, and they have a large impact on tropical climate. However, it is unclear how IOD variability will evolve under anthropogenic climate change. Here we show the results of a 22-model ensemble of simulations with the Community Climate System Model 5.0 to explore the impact of anthropogenically induced changes on the IDOs under three greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. We find that all models capture the general features of IDOC – that is, ICDs are stronger under the RCP8.5 (+2.6°C) scenario, while IDCs become stronger with increased greenhouse gases. Our analysis shows that the models are sensitive to the strength of atmospheric temperature feedback on IO variability. While some of our models show a strengthening of both the positive phase of IT",344,189,0.5919540229885057,7.808409848862705,0.8983677668536093,0.04536041027631624,0.9199999999999999,0.9130666666666667,0.817898491501468,78.63461538461539,78.59770114942529,85.21829330608074

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of climate changes on crop yield of soybean using the simulations of crop growth models. This is carried out on the basis of four different climate scenarios (A1B, B1, A2 and A1T) for a reference period 1984–2010 and a future climate scenario 2080–2100. The study highlights that climate variability and change have significant influence on productivity, especially with respect to yield gap and productivity growth, while the crop model used does not seem to capture the climate effect very well. It is also observed that soybean yields can change up to 50 % depending upon climate and the type of scenario used, and that the yield change is more pronounced in warmer and wetter scenarios.",346,181,0.51875,6.561726144849387,0.870677688817838,0.058672990671919285,0.88,0.8732352941176467,0.7726802331023943,57.68404763252751,58.725,61.026600363091006

Abstract
Water is considered as a 'common pool resource' as it can be easily depleted if left unmanaged. Climate change and its impact on water resource availability has been a cause of concern across the world. There are several reports on the impact of climate change at global, regional and local scales. However, in India the assessment and monitoring of impact at local scale is not very common, except in certain regions like the Himalayas where water is already in shortage, and in some coastal areas where sea level rise and cyclones have been impacting the water availability. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology and approach that can assess the effect of climatic change on different water sources like surface water, groundwater, etc. In this chapter an attempt is made to develop an approach, methodology, tools and indicators to assess and monitor the climate impact and associated changes on surface and groundwater resources.

Abstract
In order to understand how water availability in Mahānadi basin will be under various scenarios projected by the climate models for the 2071–2090 period and for various periods from 2065 through 2099, the present study was carried out with two sets of data. The study is based on 1D lumped mass balance model which was applied to the catchments in this region. A detailed analysis has been done to find the water balance of the study basin using 30 years of observed and projected data of meteorological elements. From the analysis of 1980 to 2015, it was found that, water storage of Mahnādī river basin is 0.25% of total water available in India. Water storage in 2050 was 3.9% and 7% in year 2105 which is very much inadequate.

Abstract
The Western Himalaya is a region that holds great promise for the development of a green economy. The region has a rich biodiversity and is home to about 60,000 species of flowering plants, of which over 3,500 are endemic to the region. It has the largest number of globally threatened species. This region is also home for many endangered and indigenous communities whose traditional knowledge about local climatic conditions and its impact on their livelihoods is very important to help them adapt to climatic changes. However, the climate of this region and especially the mountainous areas where 70% of the land is located, is rapidly changing. These climatic variations will have a direct impact and will threaten the biodiversity of both plants and animals, as well as the traditional cultures of these communities. In this paper, we will present a review of climate",353,182,0.5567567567567567,7.572710607566219,0.8878185977217553,0.049480769750628796,0.8914285714285715,0.8782608695652178,0.7967497337041161,66.0093038453105,61.24324324324324,59.73432612095933

Abstract
The paper examines the agroecological approach in mitigating climate variability and change in Teheru-Gahwal, which is in India's Himalayan foothills, using a participatory rural appraisal approach, to investigate the potential for climate resilience and adaptation in smallholder farming. The results from the participatory survey show that the small-scale farmers in this region have adopted agroforestry (AGF), conservation agriculture, mixed cropping, intercropping and inter-seasonal cropland management practices. These farming practices, when practised collectively, can contribute significantly towards adaptation to climate shocks. This is because these practices have the ability to improve crop yields in droughts and floods and protect against soil erosion in floods, and to maintain soil moisture and fertility in dry spells. Moreover, the farmers' participation in various agricultural development activities such as agro-foresty, conservation agricultural farming, integrated farming and farm mechanization have improved their adaptive capacity",357,200,0.5958549222797928,8.277881133609988,0.9016172257996103,0.04304541995628211,0.8971428571428571,0.8639053254437868,0.8165101706863167,59.24367088607595,73.11398963730569,68.1137445887446

Abstract
We present (13)C data of peat-forming plant biomass from the western ghats of southern peninsular India, and the results of a numerical model for carbon isotope composition. We interpret the data in the context of changes in precipitation and temperature, based on the 18O and 17O records. During the last glacial cycle (~ 20 kyears), the southward expansion of cold air from northern mid-latitudes led to the formation of an ice sheet over northern India. The resulting climate amelioration was followed by a shift in monsoon rainfall to more southern latitudes. This resulted in higher rainfall over the southern ghat region, but with a pronounced shift to earlier and drier monsoons, which were probably related to a change in sea surface temperature - in particular, the warming of tropical waters.",359,189,0.5649717514124294,7.516460280028289,0.8896902956665786,0.049070736731647274,0.8914285714285715,0.8857516339869272,0.8006632177200541,75.42014425254649,71.40677966101696,71.21652868969454

1. Introduction
The Indian monsoons are considered to be the most intense and variable of the world's atmospheric circulations (Wigley 1990). As a seasonal climate phenomenon, the monolithic character of rainfall over India is due in part to the large-scale circulation of atmospheric flow over the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal, which is modulated by the land–sea contrast between India and Southeast Asia [for reviews see e.g. “The South Asia monograph series on monosytem monoclimates 2”, (“Monsoon India”)] and is enhanced by a series of low-level cyclonic circulation patterns (""the Indian low"") that occur seasonally and on interannual time scales ",363,182,0.5853658536585366,7.496340570653091,0.8949936740627862,0.04741026146370229,0.86,0.8597142857142858,0.8013861602111271,54.666666666666664,59.40243902439025,56.450980392156865

Abstract
The Indian-Ocean region is one of the most vulnerable region in the world in terms of climatic hazards. The climate hazards in Madagascar are mainly caused by the tropical cyclones (TCs), El Niño and La Niña. In the past few decades, Madagascar has been affected by several TCs. However, there is a lack of scientific research on the TC impact and the vulnerability of this island. This study presents an assessment of TC impacts and vulnerability analysis of two main island ‘Antsiranana’ and ’Sandrovo’ in south Madagascar, and a comparison of impacts of El-Nino and la-nino years.

Abstract
HRD plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of an organisation. HR practitioners are increasingly being called upon to be responsible in the context of climate change and climate action. Therefore, it is important to examine the role of human resource development in building organisational commitments for climate actions. The purpose of the study is to understand the dimensions of Human Resource Development (HR) climate on organisational climate commitments in India. To test this, the research employed a survey design to collect responses from HR professionals working at different levels. Using a five-point Likert scale, survey responses were collected from the HR professional population. Data from 100 HR Managers and Directors was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences [IBM®] SPSS® 23.0. It is found that Human resources development climate has a positive influence on employees’ perceptions of their organisations’ climate commitment.

Abstract
The study was carried out at the experimental farm of the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan to estimate the impact of climate change on crop productivity at sub-tropical agro-climatic region of Pakistan. The study focused on the rice-wheat production system, where the yield of major crop rice depends on water supply. Rice-Wheat crop system is the main source of income of small-holdings farmers of this area and contributes substantially towards the economy of country.

The Indian summer monsoon is considered one of the most important natural climate variables in India, influencing the distribution and intensity of rainfall as well as the water balance of various parts of south Asia. This paper examines the relationship between seasonal temperature and precipitation, which forms the basis of seasonal forecasting of precipitation in Kerala. The data used was obtained through measurements taken at the Regional Research Laboratory (India Meteorological Department) at Cheruvattumala, Kerala from 1952-2009.
This study has shown significant variations in the annual, inter-annual and decadal means of summer rainfall. An increasing trend in precipitation was found to be significant in almost every season. In the summer season, there was a significant increase in rainfall from the 70s to the present, with a maximum rate of increase being 5 mm/yr. During the inter - seasonal monsoons, a decrease of maximum summer rains was also reported. From the decennial data, it can be said",372,199,0.5360824742268041,7.466764849624476,0.8816469158628953,0.051732229497315,0.8571428571428571,0.8571764705882348,0.7795246393584763,64.66666666666667,57.68556701030928,55.80834001603849

Abstract
The carbonate record of the last deglaciation is one of Earth's most valuable archives of past climate change. Here we use a 0.25 mm-scale record in the sediment from an oceanic basin to test the hypothesis that ocean carbonates preserve climatic signals. We present a record spanning the past 400 ka from cores collected at 5°W in 2002 during Leg 204 of R/V Mirai. This basin contains sediments that record the evolution of Indian summer monsoons (ISM), which influence the regional climate by transporting moisture from ocean to land. The record is sensitive to climatic and oceanographic variability over the 3 last 100 ky. At 180°E, where the ISM is strongest, we observe a strong negative δ18O record at the onset of glacial and interglacial warm episodes, whereas at ∼80°N, the opposite is",373,196,0.5879120879120879,7.931367688273783,0.8979290603269261,0.04516270601703134,0.9085714285714285,0.9045569620253154,0.8203623304233264,61.584899095337505,73.63186813186813,78.11247541087633

Abstract
Climate data are crucial to evaluate the impacts of climate changes. The objective of this study was to assess the trends in climatic variables and to identify the dominant climate variables that are most relevant to the agricultural production in the 11 agro-climatic zones of India using statistical methods. For this, monthly climate data of the years 1991 to 2010 were used. A total of 12 variables, including temperature (mean, minimum, maximum), rainfall [monsoon, post-monsoonal, long-term (<6-month), short-termed (>6–<12-months) and seasonal (-seasonal)]], sunshine & radiation, and wind were extracted from the daily meteorological data.

Abstract
We explore a framework for political economists to explain the design and implementation of policies on energy, the environment, climate change, renewable energy technologies and energy access, focusing on the three largest energy users in South-East Asia, India (1 billion people), Indonesia (~260 million), and Viet Nam (>90 million). Our framework has three levels. At the first, or macro level, we explore the role and influence of actors who seek to influence the policy agenda, their strategies, goals and resources. The micro level concerns the objectives of policy – what is being achieved or sought to be achieved. It includes issues of efficiency and equity, as well as environmental impacts. Finally, policy is situated in particular contexts. We focus on how the macro and micro levels interact to produce a political-economic framework, which we apply to the energy issues in India.

Abstract. A total of 200 farmers were randomly selected to assess climate perception, climate adaptation strategy, and climate coping mechanisms. The results showed that the majority of respondents (85%) had noticed the climate changes. Farmers perceived the current climate as ‘normal’. They were able to perceive the impact of climate-related events and their adaptation strategies. They adapted to the changing climate and adopted several climate protection measures.
The results of this study can contribute to better adaptation to changing climatic conditions in the region, including increased crop diversity and the cultivation of new crop varieties. It is also possible to develop new climate risk insurance schemes, improve irrigation, increase crop yields, protect livestock, develop drought- and heat-resistant crops, as well as the development of more drought and flood-resilient crops.",378,181,0.5170454545454546,6.8593830891441225,0.8724250013820157,0.056813306131187236,0.8514285714285714,0.8400000000000001,0.7497551461167917,49.63998734577665,46.88068181818182,47.9837848471223

Abstract
Climate variability and its effects on society have been a major issue in India. The country is prone to floods, cyclones, drought, landslides, earthquakes, and epidemics. In the recent past, the country has been hit by severe climate disasters like cyclone Aila (2009), cyclonic storm Fani 2019 and the earthquake in Jammu and Kashmir in 2005. This paper focuses on the perceptions, awareness, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, practices and perceptions of the community towards climate variability, climate hazards and climate predictions with respect to agriculture. It examines the role of indigenous cultural values in adaptation to climate and disasters in rural communities. For understanding the issues around climate prediction, 20 households from three villages were interviewed using semi structured questionnaires. Findings indicate that most people had a good knowledge regarding the causes of various climate events. However, a majority of them did not believe that climatic changes would affect their agriculture in future",381,194,0.5515463917525774,7.6821522972097975,0.8870453025433731,0.04937259028127049,0.8628571428571429,0.8592941176470588,0.7780613013022443,60.42099151618561,54.365979381443296,40.0640691026597

Abstract: This paper presents a study on the relationship between the climatic oscillation and the fishery catch rate in a sub-tropical region, which has a strong influence in tuna fisher. The study used the time-frequency technique and wavelets transform to analyse tuna landings time -series of the western Indian ocean, from 1972 to 2001. Using the wave-let analysis, two dominant modes were extracted from the data. From the first mode, the annual cycle is identified; and from second mode the monthly cycle and subannual cycle are identified, and are found to be the dominant oscillators. Then, an autocorrelation analysis was applied to the second harmonic of this oscillator. Finally, a Granger causality test is applied in order to check the causation between two series. It was shown that the fishing activity is affected by climatic conditions.

Abstract
Solar activities have significant effects on climate and weather systems of the earth. These effects can be either direct or indirect. The direct effects, mainly through variations in solar flux, are responsible for changing the atmospheric circulation and hence affecting the climate of various regions. On the other hand, indirect effects of solar variations can also modify the circulation in the atmosphere, through changes in stratospheric circulation, or the tropospheric heating, both of which can influence the weather and climate at the surface.
In this study, we attempt to examine the possible impacts of sunspot activity, sun activity (UV flux) and interplanetary magnetic field — which are three main factors responsible [directly or indirectly] for solar activities – on Indian monsoon, winter and summer weather. To this end, monthly averages of maximum, minimum, and average temperatures of Indian regions were examined for each season.

Abstract:
The present study assesses the social dimensions of climate vulnerability in an Indian coastal village of West Bengal. It is observed that the village, which has already experienced severe flooding and other climatic extremes, is highly sensitive to climatic changes, and therefore, has low resilience capacity. The vulnerability of this community is further amplified by its social characteristics such as a high dependence on natural resources, low income level, large household size, female-headed households, poor education levels, high illiteracy rate and low access to information. These factors are considered as drivers for climate-induced displacement and vulnerability. This study also explores the coping capacities of the community, through various livelihood strategies such a shifting cultivation, fishing, livestock rearing, migration and cultivation with the use of chemical fertilizers. Further analysis is conducted on the gender and age dimensions for the assessment of climatic change and its vulnerability at the household level",389,183,0.5572916666666666,7.722059850411245,0.8887937133189766,0.04870416801911237,0.8857142857142858,0.8742857142857138,0.8040546043389145,80.91065519523494,66.58333333333333,71.00468200100553

The recent report on climate change from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been the subject of much debate in recent weeks. While many countries, including India, have been making their own efforts towards addressing climate issues, it’s time that we start to understand our own climate and the impacts that changing weather systems and rising temperatures are having on agricultural production. The Indian government, through the Ministry of Science and Technology, has established an independent panel to look into the effects of climate-change on Indian agricultural practices. Here the authors present the salient findings of this study.

Abstract
The mean and extreme states of climate variables, and the variability of these variables in the context of a 100 year hindcast are presented for the period 1900–2007 using an ocean-atmosphere coupled climate model. The mean climatological state of SINDICZ and SITIC is presented and their interdecadal variability is investigated. It is found that there is a large interannual variability in SIN, particularly for summer SST, that is not well described by the model, which is in line with previous studies. SIC exhibits high variability on the decadal time scale. There is evidence to show that SINTIC shows a strong link to the inter-decennial variability and inter annual variability exhibited by SINA, SICA and SI. These findings provide further support for earlier findings that the SIA and ENA are",392,185,0.5535714285714286,7.175105773237274,0.8845884770800294,0.0518631382467708,0.84,0.8413888888888893,0.7869976949225523,50.756554307116104,55.875,52.00830419580419

Abstract. The Indian Monsoon System (IMS) and the associated atmospheric circulation is analysed in a 0.5° horizontal resolution regional atmosphere-ocean GCM [COSMOS], coupled to an ocean GOM / OGCM 3D model. IMS is simulated in its inter-annual – decadal - multi-decadal variability. A set of 14 experiments has been carried out, with a resolution of ∼50 km, in order to study the sensitivity of I.
In order for the simulations of monsoons to represent the actual variability of these systems, the IIS must be correctly simulated. This is done with the use of a new set-up for atmospheric I/O, where the vertical grid is not fixed and a grid-box approach is used for vertical",393,193,0.5868263473053892,7.583467678834541,0.8958524857038691,0.04685596010469105,0.8733333333333332,0.8791608391608395,0.8072236650230193,56.11559139784946,69.03592814371258,58.674090038314176

Abstract
Gender roles and perceptions of gender are important for sustainable adaptation to climate change among mountain indigenous communities. In the present study, the authors investigated how gender, wealth, and climate perceptions are linked in relation to livelihood adaptation among Adis of East India. A total of 100 respondents were interviewed in four villages of West Kameng district in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh using structured questionnaires. The authors used a qualitative approach with a thematic analysis of responses and content analysis to explore the relationship between livelihood and household strategies of adaptation. Gender roles were found to play a significant role in adaptation planning among households.

The results suggest that summer rainfall in Saudi Arabia varies strongly with Indian summer monsoon, as shown by the strong positive correlation between Indian Niño3.4 SST and summer precipitation in the western Arabian peninsula. During El NiÑo years, the monsoonal precipitation is enhanced with the largest values in El-Niño summer (July and August) over the Arabian Gulf and the southern Red Sea. In contrast, during La-NiÑa years the precipitation during summer is decreased with maximum values during the northern winter months. Summer rainfall variability over Saudi is found to be mainly determined by a strong relationship between the NINO 3-2 SSTA with summer temperature at surface layer in Arabian Sea and with precipitation over western peninsula during Nino-3 years.

Abstract. India is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to its highly populated regions and extensive agricultural land which is very much susceptible to the climate changes like extreme weather. In the last one century India has experienced more than 50% of climate variability and change in the country. This variability can be attributed to natural and anthropogenic sources. The present study will focus on the impact of anthropogenically driven changes in emission of carbon dioxide, methane, black carbon, and tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols on surface radiative forcings and their impact to global and regional climate, specifically the monsoon and its variability. We will investigate the emission estimates of CO2, CH4, BC and SO2 and compare with the observational data. These emission estimation results will be used as input parameter for the aerosol transport and chemistry",396,188,0.5837837837837838,7.940317918613124,0.8968988674357213,0.04547566083002572,0.8799999999999999,0.8596273291925465,0.7939859990270803,68.45643730549634,68.46486486486486,56.110704294882346

In India, extreme climatic changes, including increasing temperatures and precipitation variability and frequency, have been affecting agriculture, natural ecosystems, the economy, and the well-being of human populations since the 1900s.
Extreme climate has also been identified as contributing to the spread of disease, such as malaria, cholera and dengue fever; increased vector-borne disease; reduced water quality; crop damage due to pests and plant disease and water logging; forest dieback, forest fires and forest fragmentation. Extreme climate events such floods and severe droughts cause widespread economic and human losses. The frequency and severity of drought in the country has increased in recent years. A large proportion of the population is vulnerable to drought. Climate change has been reported to have exacerbated the frequency of extreme drought and flood events in India (IPCC, 2007b).

Abstract
In a context of climate change, there is a growing concern among forest fringing communities about the future of their livelihood. The present paper aims to understand and explore the perceptions, adaptation strategies and the coping mechanisms adopted by the forest-fringing communities of the Eastern Himalayan Region, India. For this study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the villages of North and South Sikkim, which are located in close proximity to the Tsomgo Lake and Nathula Pass, respectively. Using a mixed method approach, 500 households were surveyed by administering a self-administered structured questionnaire. A total of 300 household were also subjected to a focus group discussion. Analysis based on both quantitative and qualitative responses was undertaken and key themes were identified to explore adaptation and coping strategies. Findings of this research showed that, majority of respondents were not aware about climate related changes and were unaware about any adaptation measures undertaken by them or their forefathers.

The cement industry is one of key sectors in global economy that has major contribution to greenhouse gas ((GHG) emissions. It is estimated that 8.1% of all global anthropogenic “green house gas” [GHGs] emissions are from cement production. Thus, it is imperative to identify and implement climate strategies to mitigate GHGs. A literature survey has been conducted to assess the GHG emission levels of cement industries in India. The research findings have revealed a significant difference from the earlier reports in terms of GH G emissions and their mitigation strategy implementation.

The Indian ocean is at the crossroads of three major challenges: climate, biodiversity loss and food insecurity. The region is home to more than 500 million inhabitants, 1.5 billion people depend on fish as a main source of protein, the region’s marine biodiversity is the richest and most diverse in terms of species in relation to the area and it hosts a quarter of the world’ food basket. At the same time, it is a region with a low level of economic development, with more then 50% of its people living below the poverty line. In spite of this region being rich in fish and marine products, only 4% comes from fisheries and aquaculture production. This low production is due to lack of investment in fisheries (",401,183,0.5738636363636364,7.613161450588532,0.8925896533613011,0.047833329189478746,0.8857142857142856,0.8776315789473684,0.797313094019179,59.26683716965047,62.98295454545455,60.416215638797894

Abstract
Mean-State Bias is a common error source in atmospheric models. The impact on climate variability, which is often considered to be the most critical source of uncertainty for the projections of global mean climate, has attracted considerable attentions. However, the impact, so far, is not well quantified, especially for regional climate. To explore the impacts of mean bias on East Africa, we use the ERA40 Re-Analysis data to investigate the relationship between the mean state bias and the climate variables over East Afica for 1961-1990. We found that mean biases over central and southern Africa significantly affect rainfall variability over Eastern Africa",402,189,0.5549738219895288,7.669890816099669,0.8878896268442072,0.04914894046072813,0.8285714285714285,0.8330538922155687,0.779391953027629,53.27677369344376,48.596858638743456,44.65277049883272

Abstract
The Indian monsoon rainfall, which is strongly influenced by sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, is a dominant component of global weather and climate. The monsoonal precipitation is highly sensitive to global warming, due to its close association with tropical warming. In this study, a global climate model (GCM) experiment has been carried out with doubled concentrations of CO(2 ), which has a major impact on the atmospheric circulation. A high resolution 3-dimensional GCM of 0.25∘ horizontal grid size and 15 vertical levels, GFDL-AM3, with an ocean model has performed this climate experiment. This model simulates the 20th and the beginning of this century [1961−2010 &1999−2004] and was used for the period of January-September for each year.

Abstract
Ethical climate at the organizational level is a key determinant of organizational outcomes. This study explores the impact of two different types of ethics climate on the employee commitment and the effect of ethical practices on these climates. It also studies how these two dimensions of climates interact with job performance in the Indian bank sector. The results show that in an Indian context, an ethical culture with high levels of fairness and integrity is more beneficial than a culture that is less ethical, in terms of job and personal commitment. A strong ethical orientation also has an impact on organizational performance. Further, results indicate that the two types interact in different ways on commitment; fairness climate has a positive impact, whereas honesty climate is negatively impacted by ethical climates that are less honest. In sum, the findings indicate an interdependency between an organization’s ethical and ethical commitment climates on job satisfaction and performance outcomes, thereby supporting the argument that an employee’ willingness to remain with the organization is an outcome of both an individual",405,198,0.44019138755980863,6.3637730675678865,0.8464069007636524,0.06619974790201477,0.9,0.8655135135135128,0.7611599979300506,52.420751633986924,52.17224880382775,50.67085504728817

Abstract
The Indian subcontinent is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate and climate-related hazards, including floods, droughts, landslides and heat waves. These hazards threaten the lives of millions of people, damage agricultural and forest resources, and cause billions of dollars in economic losses. Climate change, the increase in global temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions, will further aggravate the impact of these hazards. This is why the Indian Government has taken climate vulnerability assessments seriously, in order to inform policy development and to identify areas in need of adaptation action. In this paper, we examine what the results of such assessments might mean for managing water and other natural resources in a country like India. We find that the impacts of floods and drought are likely to increase as global warming continues, while the effects of heatwaves are projected to diminish. The effects on agriculture are also likely be severe,",408,183,0.5614973262032086,7.6783604533348715,0.8896699898684007,0.04856412956526543,0.8628571428571429,0.8792638036809813,0.7830252354835701,63.33008320332813,65.02139037433155,67.39286879363215

Abstract
We show that the present geotectonics of western India, especially the northward migration of the continental margin, can be explained by an equatorial migration (EM) of Africa from the T-T boundary during the Late Cretaceous. The EM model explains the tensional strain in the western margin of Indian Ocean (> 30 N) by the collision between Indian and African plates, and also the convergence in India (< 60 N). We show by numerical modeling of plate boundary migration and the associated mantle plume migration that these two features are consistent with the EM mechanism. We propose that India moved 50 km to the northwest relative to Africa during this time, which is the same order of magnitude as the current separation rate between these continents. In this model, India's north–south movement and India/Africa separation during EM is consistent and can account for the observed convergence between",411,199,0.5445026178010471,7.525175895041185,0.8842629696962797,0.050738858959949125,0.8742857142857143,0.8826347305389208,0.8013334304268643,76.13703545105366,68.92670157068063,68.57167050535159

Abstract. This study assesses the impact of model resolutions in climate models on the projections of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall. We use the 20th Century Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 4 ""experiment"" 6 [RCP 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCS 8.0) to simulate the ISM and the associated extreme rainfall events. In addition to using two- and four-member 3 km atmospheric models, we also use a higher resolution model to investigate the sensitivity of ISMs to higher and lower resolution models. To evaluate the performance of climate predictions, an ISMR (""Indian Summer Rainfall Monsoonal Rain"" index, defined as total seasonal rainfall in a monsoons) is calculated.

Abstract
The present climate conditions and the future climate projections indicate that, in general, the Indian summer monsoon is likely to be more intense with higher rainfall and more frequent and stronger rainfall events. This is expected to affect the river flows which in turn could affect hydropowering. To estimate the projected change in the power output, this study has used a global hydrological model and a hydrotechnical model. Projection of rainfall under various climate scenarios has been done using two climate models, HadRM3.1 and HadCM3, with the period of 1950–2035. The hydrologic model is used to simulate streamflow using the calibrated parameters for the selected sub-catchment, which is considered as a reference catchment for comparison. A hydrotectical hydraulic model has also been used for simulation and estimation of the energy available from the sub catchments. It has estimated an increase of about 2% to",415,190,0.5348837209302325,7.0149342352998145,0.8784445709300199,0.05437436022705512,0.8133333333333334,0.8362162162162167,0.7808749156283858,49.131332082551594,53.55813953488372,46.43766404199475

Abstract
A comprehensive study based on data of the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite altimetry of surface winds and wave heights in 2-km resolution in Indian ocean and the Bay of Bengal for 1984–1991 period is presented. The objective of this paper is to analyze the seasonal/interannual variability and climatology of winds over the region as well as its associated ocean waves by means of wavelet analysis. It is also investigated the relationship between the wind and waves at regional scale. For the period of 3 years, 8 years and 10 years respectively, the dominant modes of variability are identified by using wavelets. These dominant waves have been identified as the Rossby-gravity wave, Kelvin wave and Rossbyswings.

Women's vulnerability to environmental risks in the context of climate variability and change and their impacts is of paramount importance in developing countries including India. The present paper highlights women' vulnerability in India in a context where the impact of changing climate and variability are beginning to be perceived by the policy makers. A literature review shows that the impacts of environmental and climatic change can be expected to increase women’s vulnerabilities as compared to men in different contexts and regions, but there is little research on this area in Indian context. Women are more vulnerable to water, food, health, shelter and livelihood issues. There are several reasons for this. Some of these are that women are mostly engaged in agricultural production and are involved in household food production as well as in livestock rearing. In rural areas women play a major role in food preparation, storage, processing, marketing and distribution. Their role is much more than that of men. They are also the ones who take care of children and household tasks and",418,196,0.5046728971962616,7.382728011866363,0.8725591046282665,0.054685951837891815,0.86,0.8566315789473694,0.766795464531425,49.34627329192547,51.401869158878505,48.3409282700422

Abstract
The impacts of rising sea levels and extreme climate on coastal populations are expected to grow rapidly in the 21st century, especially in low-lying coastal deltas and small island states. The extent to which these impacts occur, however, will depend on the exposure of vulnerable coastal communities. A major challenge is the lack of information regarding the relative impacts, and thus relative vulnerability, on a spatial scale for many coastal nations. We develop a method to map the extent and relative magnitude of the potential impacts for coastal settlements in India, based on their exposure and sensitivity to the combined effects of sea level rise, storms, drought, extreme temperatures and flooding. These are the same variables used in our earlier work to estimate global-scale relative risks to coastal infrastructure and settlements. To map these variables, we use gridded global climate data from the NASA Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase III. For a sample of coastal Indian settlements we then estimate seaward and landward displacement probabilities under climate",421,200,0.4975369458128079,7.088810304070324,0.8686131377262313,0.056939149673508695,0.885,0.8920670391061455,0.7782976420613781,62.27919320594481,57.33990147783251,54.87722222222222

Abstract
In the recent times climate has become more and more unstable. It is the result of the changes in the natural processes. The main cause of all the climatic changes is global warming which is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases.The emission has to be reduced to avoid further damage to the planet. India as a developing country depends on its agriculture economy and is vulnerable to any climatic change. This paper examines the impact of climatic instability on the agriculture sector of India. In the past few years India has witnessed an increase in its economy which has made it vulnerable.

The Indian monsoon is an important climatic system for the Indian sub-continent. The present work studies the last 100 yr of stalactite growth rates ([S.sub.st.a]) in the Northeast Indian state of Manipur. This stalactic record is found to display two periods of rapid growth: 1856-1865 and 1926 and a slower rate of growth from 1866 to 1936. Based on these rates we have calculated a total ""growth"" of 4.5 m, with two phases of high growth and one of low growth. Our growth rate is in good agreement with that estimated by [[L]., 2011].

The Indonesian throughflow (ITF) plays a key role in the climate system by affecting the thermocline depth in both the equatorial Pacific ([1]) and Atlantic oceans and by providing a pathway for heat and salt to move from the western Pacific to the eastern tropical Atlantic [2, 3,5,6]. The ITF has strong interannual variability - both in terms of the magnitude of heat flux through it and in its strength and spatial pattern. The strength of ITFs varies on decadal timescales, and the interdecadal oscillation of strength, which has been termed the Indo-Pacific inter-decal variability, is thought to be due to variations in Indian and Pacific basin sea surface temperature forcing (). The magnitude and direction of ocean-atmosphere heat coupling associated with the variability of these basin-scale heat transports have important consequences for climate change and variability.

Abstract
Climate change is expected to have a significant effect on agriculture in coming decades. In this research, simulations of climate impact and adaptation of two major agricultural regions were carried out in two climate models, using the CORDEX (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) framework, and the results were compared with the observed data. The results indicate that in future climate of the major maize producing regions - the Indo-Gangetic plains of Northern India and southern parts of Maharashtra & Gujarat – will become more favorable, leading to an increase in maize productivity in the coming years under future scenarios. However, there are large differences in regional impacts of global climate changes.

Abstract
This study examines the linkages between migration and climate-induced agricultural distress in a rural village in India. Based on data from 2000-01 to 2014-15, the study reveals the role of migration as an adaptation mechanism in the face of climate risk, especially in light of the recent heat wave in 2020. The findings indicate that the climate shock in summer has increased the propensity of male migrants from the village to migrate to urban destinations. In contrast, female migrants do not change their destination. These results indicate the different coping mechanisms adopted by farmers depending on their gender, age, and education.

This paper studies the determinants of innovation, its export orientation and the productivity of manufacturing firms for the year 2007/08, based upon the data from the Indian Manufacturing Survey. The estimation approach adopted is the “difference-in-differences” (DiD) approach and uses the firm level ""Exporting vs. Non-exporting"" as an instrument for productivity, and 'R' as a lagged variable for innovation. Results indicate that firms which export have higher levels of productivity. This is not surprising, since export-oriented firms face the pressure of having to compete with international firms on quality, which is a necessary precondition for exporting. Moreover, export firms also tend to be large, as the export market is large. In addition, firms in the non- exporting group tend not to export because they cannot compete against foreign firms. They also do not innovate because innovation is an internal process of change that",427,191,0.4793814432989691,6.677010875144965,0.8604255005148416,0.06100812743480846,0.8228571428571428,0.8355294117647062,0.7715309873490666,45.920212765957444,46.675257731958766,43.374926649341944

Abstract
Cities play a critical role in global climate change impacts and adaptation. The Himalayan region is projected to be one of the most vulnerable regions, and cities are likely to bear the brunt of extreme climate events. This paper seeks to contribute to understanding of adaptation processes in Himalayan urban environments. Households living in two informal settlements in Shimla were studied to understand their adaptation strategies, decisionmaking processes, vulnerability and coping capacities. A mixed-methods approach was used to elicit information through a semi-structured questionnaire, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a household survey. Results indicate that adaptation to climate hazards is not yet well understood, though some households have been able to identify and implement adaptation responses. Vulnerability and capacity analyses were conducted to assess the vulnerability to and the coping capacity of households and community groups. These analyses indicated that the capacity for households to cope with climate-change impacts is affected by gender, education level, income level and household size.

Abstract
In this article, we present results of an assessment of climate and agricultural variability in India and how small farmers respond to this variability. Our study uses a combination of survey data gathered from 2005 to 2010, and weather data (rainfall, temperatures, wind speed, etc). Using these data, climate change impacts have been estimated, which in turn are expected to be compounded by other stressors such as market volatility and increasing cost of inputs like fertilizer. The impacts of these compounded stressors, on smallholders are also estimated. We find that the compunction of stressors is greater for the farmers, particularly, women farmers. These farmers are found to face higher costs of production and lower yields compared to other farming systems.",429,200,0.5684210526315789,7.835143501188126,0.8923403366808514,0.04724497781336789,0.8228571428571428,0.8120481927710848,0.7836820492810362,46.244714587737846,47.96842105263158,45.44740500463392

Abstract
Indian summer Monsoon (ISM) is one of the most crucial phenomena in the climate system. There is considerable evidence of a change in rainfall pattern in ISM. The present study is an effort to examine the intrasonan season ‘variation of ISMs by using the Regional Climate Model of IMD [Integrated Research on Monsoons and the Indian Diasporas] developed by IIT-M under ISRO funded project named ” Regional Scale Study of Climate change Impacts and Predictions”.The model has been used to predict rainfall of three seasons namely – winter, summer and autumn for four different regions of India. It is shown that the model is successfully predicting the rainfall distribution during all four seasons of 1999 to 2009. In addition, the ISMR of these four regions is examined for intrasonic seasons 1979 -200",433,183,0.6012269938650306,7.675952409881982,0.9001162793464808,0.04515155968448321,0.8866666666666666,0.902446043165467,0.8111705494032186,63.814470686967994,71.99386503067484,74.63854949874687

Abstract
A major concern of the international community is the impact of climate change on biodiversity, especially in the tropics where many species have narrow endemism ranges. The Himalayas, the Western Ghats, and the Nilgiris are the only mountain ranges in South Asia and together form the Southern Western Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspots. Here, we assess the vulnerability and conservation significance of these montanes with the aim of identifying conservation priorities in this biodiversity hotspot. We synthesize the most recent climate, land-use, vegetation, species occurrence (both plant and animal) and climate-vegetation data to understand the impacts of current and projected climate scenarios in terms of changes in biodiversity. Using the ‘hotspots’ approach, our analysis identifies three hotspots, each containing a set of endemic biodiversity of high importance. Two hotspots have a high proportion of their area within the protected area network; however, their high biodiversity and endemics have not",436,198,0.5416666666666666,7.505553499465135,0.8833846861476288,0.0510731183369025,0.8228571428571428,0.8350000000000012,0.7815128244446522,52.413293676451566,50.09375,47.11574074074074

AbstractThis paper describes the development and validation of a measure of Safety Culture – Safety Climate (“Safety Climate”) in the Indian Shipping Industry. The measure was derived from a review of available literature and through expert discussions. This measure has been validated using exploratory factor analysis [EFA). The EFA revealed two dimensions in Safety culture, one of them named as ‘safety climate’ with 7 items and the other one named “safety behavior” with three items. In this paper the validity and reliability of safety Culture measure and safety behaviour measure are reported using both of these measures.

Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to the coastal and island communities of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In 2009, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated the sea levels would rise between 18 cm and 59 cm for a global average temperature increase of 4 °C, and between one-third and one half of this amount at a temperature of two °°C. This report is part of a broader research initiative on the impact of climate change on island countries.

The mangroves of coastal India and Sri Lanka are among the fastest disappearing ecosystems worldwide, yet their responses to climate change remain understudied.
Our research team has studied the impacts of climate changes on mangal vegetation and assessed mangliferous habitats' capacity to adapt. Our analyses of satellite imagery have revealed that mangals respond to rising sea-level and climate variability by expanding their range and changing their structure. In addition, we found that the most vulnerable habitats are those that have the least capacity for adaptation. The study provides new insights on the resilience of ecosystems in the face of global climate threats, and is an important step toward the development of more effective policies and practices to ensure sustainable management of these valuable man-made ecosystems. More details can be found in a paper published in ""Nature Climate Change"" (open access).

The Indian monsoons occur in June–September (JJAS) every year, when the surface temperature over the Indian Ocean rises rapidly. A major reason for such seasonal variability is the large-scale atmospheric circulation, which includes the summer circulation “Indian monograph” [1]. The monographic studies of the seasonal variations of monomodal circulation and of its interrelationship with monolithic -mode circulation are reviewed in [[2] and references therein]. These studies indicate that the inter-annual variations in the monoidal circulation can be explained through the variations occurring in intertropical convergence zone, the subtropical jet, tropical monolith –mode and the tropical wave. The intermodes of these circulation variations have been discussed by [@Saji2016].

In the present study an experimental investigation of the performance of a solar thermal air air conditioning collector is performed at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela. This collector has been constructed by integrating a photovoltaical thermal collector with a conventional solar collector. The experiment is carried out with various solar radiation levels. It is found that the solar energy is sufficient for the operation of thermal energy storage tank of collector and thus there is no need for any external heat source. Also it is observed that thermal efficiency of air storage system reaches up to 70% in case of solar irradiation of 800 W per square meter.",447,184,0.5939849624060151,6.850168759240548,0.893483826594576,0.05015236062200764,0.8400000000000001,0.8425688073394486,0.7634526448330635,48.53877163755722,47.56390977443609,40.741176470588236

The ‘Indian summer’ is a well-known phrase that is used in Europe and North America to describe a hot, dry, late summer heatwave that occurs in India, Pakistan and parts of Bangladesh. The heat is generally attributed to the strong monsoonal winds, which push hot air from India into Pakistan. This wind then blows over parts the Himalayas, creating a temperature drop on the western slopes and warming of the air on its way down over Pakistan, leading to high temperatures in Pakistan in late May to mid July, and also over Northern India (see figure). In the last decade, the severity of these heat waves in the Indus Basin has dramatically increased — in terms of both intensity and duration: the heatwaves of 2015 and 2001 have been more intense than those of past decades, with temperatures reaching record highs and the length of their duration increasing by 10–12 days. As a region, India is particularly affected by",448,198,0.5606060606060606,7.888426505157586,0.8905621017200805,0.04765078460019561,0.8628571428571429,0.8786206896551723,0.7990292922099957,66.0,65.79292929292929,60.851085481682496

Abstract
This study aims to examine climate modes associated with interannual variability of large sea surface temperatures (SST) in a region of particular interest in terms of its climatic impacts, the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. The Indian Sea plays an important role in modulating the large scale circulation, including its role on global climate and weather pattern. This study examines the linkages between inter-annual sea level pressure ((TLS) pressure) teleconnections and SST variability in order to understand the interrelationships between these large climate patterns. These large modes are identified using the principal component analysis, where the first mode of inter annual variation of 30 year smoothed TLS is identified as a proxy for a large SSTA event, and the second mode is a representation of a local scale weather system.
The study reveals strong connections between the sea-level",453,182,0.5243243243243243,7.131581834309935,0.8763216784048902,0.054551810101402566,0.9028571428571428,0.8877018633540369,0.8013751489266285,73.64355231143553,66.56216216216217,68.84478012026372

Indian climate,Indian summer monsoon rainfall processes in climate change scenarios,"Indian summer monsoon rainfall processes in climate change scenarios: a regional case study of India
Abstract
The Indian summer precipitation is very important for the economy of the country as well as the agriculture sector. India has been experiencing significant changes in the summer rainfall patterns during the past 100 years, especially the monsoons. The monographic review reveals that the changes and trends in precipitation have occurred in different regions of this large country. This paper is focused on the analysis of monosyllabic Indian monographs that examine regional climate changes. It is observed that there is a significant decrease in summer rain events over the entire country during summer.

In an attempt to assess the regional climate impacts of global warming, the Indian monsoons of the future are projected to intensify, with a significant increase in extreme events like heavy rainfall, flood and drought. The study aims to investigate the impact of a climate change scenario on future regional weather and climate conditions, particularly during winter season, over Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra /Himalayan regions and adjacent areas, by using a regional atmospheric climate modeling system. Two climate scenarios – A1B and A2 - are used in this study.

Abstract
An ensemble of 50 years of climate simulations with the HadAM3 climate general circulation model has been undertaken to investigate the effects of elevated anthropogenic aerosols over Indian Ocean on climate. Two climate scenarios have been analyzed with respect to a base 1951–2000. The aerosol radiative forcing from the Indian region has shown an increase of more than three W m−2 over the period 1960–2010 relative to 1976–1985, indicating a significant climate impact of aerosol forcing over eastern Asia. An increase in cloud fraction over land areas of western India, northern India and Nepal has led to increased cloud-radiation feedback",459,190,0.6578947368421053,8.111071056538128,0.9166559926891626,0.038198891878104206,0.88,0.8956249999999997,0.8367060066033171,88.38236648250461,84.82894736842105,70.54688445251058

Abstract
Globally, soil carbon (C) stocks are the largest reservoir of C on land and they represent a crucial carbon pool for the terrestrial biosphere. The Himalayan region, a large part of which is covered with glaciers, is the world’s third largest repository of soil C. It is thus crucial to understand how C is stored and mobilized in these high-altitude ecosystems, especially in terms of potential feedback between C dynamics and climate change. Using a combination of remote sensing and field data, we investigated how climatic and edaphic factors affect C storage in 17 sites from different climatic zones, altitudes and lithology across the Indo-Himalaya range. We show that the soil moisture regime determines the magnitude and the depth of the organic horizon and that its depth is highly correlated with soil temperature and C/N content. Furthermore, the amount of available soil water is an important factor controlling the distribution of organic soil layers in topographically",460,195,0.575,8.131727983645296,0.8955545317691438,0.045390746069226086,0.88,0.8836363636363628,0.8079357164397799,74.02643929351915,70.95,71.70772231274378

Abstract
Globally water is the most vital natural resource for maintaining human health and the economic and social development of a society. However, climate change, population growth, and rapid industrialisation pose major threats to water security for the future, especially in the developing world, where the poorest and most vulnerable people are located. This study aims to understand the impacts of climate variability-induced water scarcity on diarrheal disease and its adaptation strategy in India. In this study, we used the Water Scarcity and Diarrhoeal Disease Model, which was designed to explore the linkages between water supply and sanitation, water quality, diarrhoeal diseases, health status, malnutrition, poverty, gender, child survival, environmental sanitation status and climate variables. The study period was from 1962–2012. We used a multi-method approach for data collection and analysis. First, primary data was collected from household members in 15 districts of India through face-to-face household interviews",462,200,0.5595854922279793,7.774010108085902,0.8896839941282056,0.04826656738687758,0.8628571428571429,0.8714792899408281,0.7914666888347848,70.2002307913261,63.3160621761658,57.43629458192392

Abstract
The regional coupled climate models COSYCLONE-CLM, CCL and CLOUDY are used to study the impact of climate scenarios by 2060–2089 on the climate of the Asian monsoons. The results are presented as two types of precipitation: (1) the precipitation of a wet season and “monsoon-like” season, and; and, 3) for all three models, as 5–95 percentile values for precipitation and temperature. For all models the monographic precipitation – which is defined as the sum of both the wet and monson-likes season in the models — increases significantly with a global mean surface warming of +1.1°C in 2018 and reaches a maximum of more than 40% above the reference value of average precipitation.

Abstract
Climate projections over South Asian region for the 2036–2055 time frame (midpoint of 1st 3 decades of the twenty-first century, 2076-2105) were obtained from eight high-resolution global climate models [GCMs] by downscaling at 4km and 2km resolution for two climate scenarios – A1B and B2 - using the Multi-Model Ensemble [(MME)] approach. The “downscalled” results from this analysis were compared with the baseline projections (‘base case’) for both the climate extremes and the mean temperature using two criteria: ‘relative change’ and a relative quantile 95th percentile. This study is the first to quantify the relative change in extreme and mean temperatures at the sub-continental scale, as well as at a regional scale. For most climate-sensitive variables, there was a statistically-robust increase in the frequency",464,197,0.5628415300546448,7.613979090832101,0.8896710447539449,0.04876523331127607,0.8457142857142858,0.8704402515723276,0.8257574570331936,64.98425402154426,71.00546448087432,65.03648051426276

The Indian Ocean (IO) plays an important role in the Asian monsoon system and the global oceanic thermohaline circulation system. In this paper, we investigate the IO warming trend during the period of 1960 2004 using data from a coupled climate model. We use two sets of the model experiments: one uses 20th-century observations of surface temperature and sea level pressure, and one includes 30-yr-long re-analyses of ocean temperature, salinity and density to estimate the interocean temperature difference. The model results demonstrate that there is a 0.3°C warming in 1990–2011 (>50% of warming occurred since 1979) and a further 3.6° 2.9°, 8° and 9.5°.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area [CMA], in which 4.6 million people live, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The city is projected to be affected by sea-level rise by 2100, which will result in a 3.5 m to 8 m rise in sea levels; extreme temperatures, and changes to rainfall and flooding. However, the Chennai CMA lacks the capacity to implement climate adaptation projects, as it has no disaster response plan in place. To address this, a disaster-risk reduction plan – the CMAP 2014 - was formulated, to identify the most vulnerable people, communities, settlements and assets in the city. This was then used to develop a Climate Disasters Resilience Index (‘CDRI’ ) for the region.

Abstract
The magnetic susceptibility and coercivity were determined for sedimentary samples taken from the northern Bay Of Bengal (BoB) and Andamans. The BoB samples show that the magnetic field of magnetite is of a lower strength than is that observed in similar sedi-ment in South China Sea. This is due to the fact that sedimental magnetites have formed under the influence of different magnetic and environmental field conditions. However, the magnetitic mineralogy, as determined with x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, show similarities in both sedimen and magnetism. A significant feature in this study is the detection of magnetic mineral particles with diameters smaller than 2 µm and their magnetic properties. These particles are probably produced by chemical weathering of pyroxenoids and olivines in sediment from a source area. Sedimental magnetic measurements are compared with the",467,199,0.5918367346938775,8.285714285714286,0.9006227598320835,0.04335346360719141,0.8628571428571429,0.8827906976744178,0.8076872050163862,69.08415480802424,70.47448979591837,74.62575757575758

AbstractThis paper estimates the effects that extreme weather events and temperature changes have on life expectancy at birth in rural villages in northern India using microdata on mortality collected in the National Sample Survey from 1977 to 2006. The results suggest that the mortality impact of heat waves is larger than that of droughts. This result holds for both the rural and urban villages. However, mortality from floods has a larger impact than does drought on the urban sample. A larger share of the increase in total population in villages is in low-rainfall areas during extreme events than during drought. In general, the impact on rural villagers is much larger for high temperatures than for drought, and for floods than drought; and vice versa for urban villagers. For rural areas, heat wave mortality impacts are larger in states with high levels of population density. Flood mortality increases faster in areas with higher population densities.): 8 (",469,182,0.45454545454545453,6.215815605080611,0.8492752840528168,0.06634472910150116,0.8342857142857143,0.858650306748466,0.7690762965482817,48.276205263085416,52.25133689839572,46.251278737952944

Indian climate,"Climate change, ecological stress and livelihood choices in Indian Sundarban","Climate change, ecological stress and livelihood choices in Indian Sundarban forests
This project aims to develop a better understanding of the links between livelihood options and climate change impacts.
Background
The Sundarbans is a unique tropical forest ecosystem in Bangladesh - the largest mangrove forest in the world. It provides critical ecosystem services to local communities, and is under threat. The Sundars are also a source of livelihood for the local people who depend on them – for fishing as well as collection of forest products such as honey and medicinal plants. However, the Sundans are a dynamic landscape, changing due to climate variability and human-induced land use. Understanding what drives livelihoods choices and how these choices can contribute in adapting to changing climatic conditions in a context of increasing climate instability is key for ensuring resilience of people in Sundan. For this, we need to take stock of livelihoods options of those communities who have been adapting and living in these ecosystems since long, to understand how they have adapted in past as compared to those who",472,192,0.5282051282051282,7.375983202606159,0.8789549357542593,0.05285730776519648,0.9142857142857143,0.8921637426900582,0.8019518739792085,68.22335299194476,69.95897435897436,72.04424307036248

Abstract
The objective of the study is to predict the rainfall distribution for Indian states using regional Climate Model 4 [Reg CM4] over monsoonal regions with the input data of SST and sea level pressure from GFS. The regional model Reg CM-4 and GRIMM-2 are implemented on regional grid with a resolution of 0.5° latitude and longitude. SLP is used as the initial condition in the model. In the current study, the impact of sea surface temperature [(SST) from NOAA] and atmospheric circulation – “Sea Surface Temperature /Sea level atmospheric pressure” [[SLA] ] on rainfall are analysed. RegCM- 3 is the base case model, whereas Reg. CM -3 with ‘Sla’ and Reg cm-5 is with without SLA.

Abstract. The active break spells (ABSs) of the Indian monsoons have an impact on the global climate system through various physical processes. This study uses a multi-model ensemble technique – Ensemble Prediction System [1] - to extend the predictability of ABSs for the next five days. An extended range of model forecasts — 10 days ahead –, is also analyzed. We first compare the performance of different models, using different predictors in a statistical analysis, to find out which model performs well for this task. Based on this analysis and using the ensemble of models with the highest performance, we develop an extended-range model (~ 3 days) for ABS prediction.
The extended forecast is evaluated against a benchmarking method that uses the NRLMSISE-00 model, and the results indicate that an improved prediction is",474,190,0.5392670157068062,7.452818434511943,0.8824234023081572,0.051545321247847234,0.9085714285714285,0.908982035928143,0.8105278495367907,74.94826007326007,75.65968586387434,78.98814707305273

Abstract. We investigate how Indian monsoons respond to global warming and how they are simulated in regional and general circulation models (GCM). We compare 22 models with a common atmospheric resolution (~ 2 km) that project the 20th century climate evolution until the end of the current century. The simulations start at 1950 - with the same initial temperature distribution as observed and 1850 as a reference case – and run until 2100 in the RCP 8.5 emission scenario. For each model, we project a summer rainfall index [rainfall > 10 mm d−1 (= mm day−0.1)] over India and estimate the probability of exceeding this threshold.
We show that, in agreement with observational",477,193,0.650887573964497,8.461538461538462,0.9162910667453409,0.037573245121176255,0.88,0.8921379310344825,0.8554915991074984,87.40087440676709,99.54437869822485,102.38095238095238

Abstract
Biodiversity of the Indian Himalayas is the richest and the most diverse of any region in the world. The region is endowed with 12 major biogeographic regions. This study deals with the impacts of climatic changes on Himalayan biodiversity with a special focus on the impact of global warming, and provides an overview on climate and climate related parameters affecting flora and fauna. In the present paper various factors are considered which affect the Himalayan flora-fauna in a bid to predict the effect of changing climatic conditions on this unique ecosystem of biodiversity. It has been found that Himalayan Flora and Fauna are likely to be adversely affected with increase in temperature as the alpine plants are expected to suffer most due to increased temperature, while the lowland plants would be able to survive. With the increase of temperature in alpine regions, the vegetation type may shift from a subalpine forest to a",478,180,0.4946236559139785,6.7457672909822515,0.8652904282166519,0.05935615927045069,0.8228571428571428,0.8283950617283949,0.7653961147012125,54.00966572694321,50.86021505376344,47.93368196964087

As the 2009 Copenhagen conference nears, the world is looking for solutions to reduce CO2 emissions. A number of options are available but the main focus is currently on ‘clean coal’. However, it is not enough.
The climate situation in Asia is particularly worrying because most of these countries have very low per capita emissions but they are expected to see a dramatic increase by the middle of this century. According to climate scientists and NGOs, a rise in sea levels of around one metre and a temperature rise of 3 to 4 degrees Celsius is expected by 2100. This rise will cause flooding, droughts, and will put at risk the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. The Asian countries are among the most vulnerable to this problem. In the case of Sri-Lanka, for example, this could mean a reduction of up to a quarter of a metre in coastal areas.

Abstract
Indian Ocean is one of the largest tropical ocean in the world covering an area of 73.2 m km². The Indian monsoon plays a key role in influencing regional climate variability and changes. In the present study, the evaporation- precipitation variability is investigated over the Indian region using the Ncep CFS v2 Reanalysis (.nc format) data. A total of six variables are used to study the temporal & spatial variability of E-P variability using various statistical methods. To evaluate the model, a statistical technique is applied by comparing ENSO index. Further, EO and AO Index are also used as model validation parameter. Results show that the inter-annual variations are more prominent than intrans- annual variability. It also observed that E and P show maximum positive variance during the monsoonal period and maximum negative during pre-monsoons.

Abstract
Rice cultivation in India covers 10 million hectares and provides food for 150 million people. The rice yield is strongly related to climate change. This study estimates the impact of climate variability and change on rice production in six agroecological zones of the Indian states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Assam. We use the 1980s-based National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting climate data and the MODIS 3-monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from June 2000 to May 2010. For this time period, we use a set of remote-sensing- and weather-model-driven methods to estimate and compare the effect of temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. Our estimates show that rice is highly affected by the temperature increase. In addition, a decrease in precipitation is likely to have a major impact in Maharashtra; the",483,192,0.581151832460733,8.03167811874588,0.89666508528743,0.0453017988234222,0.8914285714285713,0.8857485029940114,0.820520467592767,70.98211589252017,75.10994764397905,77.09819569743235

Abstract. Climate models of global scale are able to simulate the large scale patterns and dynamics of oceanic circulation but have been found to overestimate the strength of Indian and Atlantic Oceans (AO) Walker circulations. It is proposed here that these errors are due to the inability of model to properly represent the strong winds that form the surface boundary layer in the subtropical gyres and are crucial for the ocean to be a strong heat engine. This is supported by a direct comparison between the wind speed and sea surface temperature at the 200 hPa level for a range of locations in both hemispheres. The results show that the models simulate strong eastward winds at ~ 1000 hpa and these winds are responsible for transporting water from equatorial and tropical latitudes to lat. 45∘N and higher.

A better understanding of the impact of climate change on the Indian subcontinent is crucial to mitigate and adapt to its adverse impacts through informed water resources management policies. The present work provides a review of available literature related to drought characterization for India for the period of 1980–2010. This is done under three scenarios: current climate [1961–2000], present climate, and future climate. We identify the key characteristics of drought in India and discuss the existing literature on drought assessment. Further, to understand the future drought trends under future scenarios, we have also identified the main causes of variability of current drought and projected changes in future. Finally, the study concludes with an assessment of existing drought indicators and a recommendation for further studies.

Abstract
Climate variability, including drought events, is expected to intensify in the future in South Asia, which is home to a fifth of the world population. Here, we analyze the impact of climate variability and climate change scenarios on current and future soil moisture under present and more extreme climate conditions, using an integrated modeling approach at a pan-tropical scale. The Soil Moisture Accounting for Climate (SMACC) approach provides a unique opportunity to assess climate impacts on soil-moisture regimes under current as well as future climate. Our approach combines a process-based soil model of 1-km resolution with a regional crop model — the Global Crop and Terrestrial Ecosystems Model – to analyze climate effects on crop water use under different climate scenarios. We analyze soil water changes in a set of regions under four scenarios: a) current climate, b) RCP 2.6 (~2°",490,185,0.55,7.379024325749306,0.8848754153131206,0.051046862153629594,0.8685714285714285,0.8830769230769223,0.8115216395571074,69.35681103975952,70.87777777777778,71.87354883559263

Abstract
A study of climatic factors affecting the incidence of malaria in a region has been attempted using the monthly mean maximum, minimum and mean temperatures and monthly accumulated precipitation during the monsoon, dry, winter and spring periods at DehraDun (Dehradoon), India. The study has attempted to establish a correlation between malaria and the climate and to study the influence of temperature and rainfall on malaria transmission at different seasons. Correlation between the climatic variables has also been established. A significant correlation has emerged between temperature, rainfall and incidence rate of the disease and a strong inverse relationship has developed between rainfall, and minimum temperature during summer months and disease incidence and between precipitation and temperature in winter, spring and fall months. It has further been observed that the mean temperature at a higher altitude shows a stronger relationship and that rainfall at lower altitudes shows more impact on the transmission than the rainfall in high altitudinal area",491,183,0.42391304347826086,5.750236290040988,0.8354290501724444,0.07266410046564818,0.8057142857142857,0.8165000000000002,0.7309488566821659,37.661378413524055,41.09782608695652,39.11731972038264

Abstract
In order to understand climate change impacts on tribal lands, a better understanding of tribal land and resource management is essential. In 2010, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established an official process for the consideration of the impacts of climate on developing nations, including the U.S. The National Tribal Conservation Grants Program ($2.2 million) was established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. As part of this program, this research will examine the relationship between tribal climate adaptation and tribal regulations that protect natural and cultural resources on their reservations.

Abstract
Assessment and analysis of the hydrological impacts in the catchment of river Tungabhadhra are carried out by means of a model HEC-HMS (Hydrological Engineering Center – hydrometric modeling system) to predict the changes in flow regime and the corresponding impact on agriculture, drinking water supply, and irrigation system and flood control. For the prediction of flood risk, a simple and easy to use software package, called the SIRCOM 2007 software, is employed, which is based on the conceptual model approach. The impact of different climate scenarios has been analyzed on different aspects of water resources management. A scenario for the future 2050 was developed in a two step approach: 1) the ‘business as usual’ scenario was constructed to assess climate related",493,180,0.6046511627906976,7.929925657295443,0.9022624346780211,0.04372011702968091,0.8466666666666666,0.8459459459459462,0.8155918340606948,59.47439306282983,68.0813953488372,55.59568981396205

Abstract
Sal is one of the most important plantation crops that is cultivated by the people belonging to tribal communities of India, particularly in Assam. The sal trees are grown on a wide range of soils. This study was undertaken to examine the changes in sal’s climatic range and its response to climate change. We used the sal tree as a bio-indicator for climate and environmental change in eastern India. A total of 20 sal sites across eastern and northeastern India were studied for this purpose. In all 10 sal stands were selected based on the presence of different sal communities. Sal sites selected for the study had mean altitude ranging from 80–250 m, mean temperature ranging between 23 and 24 C, and mean rainfall ranging 1000–2000 mm. Mean annual precipitation of these 15 sites was found to increase with the altitude, while mean annual",494,188,0.53125,7.361215932167729,0.8796912761713852,0.0526906928950963,0.8285714285714285,0.8602380952380951,0.7932054161325705,53.84514761682296,55.807291666666664,49.6993006993007

Abstract
This dissertation explores the role of the Integrated Assessment of Climate Change (IACC) methodology in addressing climate change in developing countries. The IACC is a tool which combines economic, ecological and social science analysis to provide an understanding of climate and the impacts of various mitigation and adaptation policies to climate. As a relatively new method, the IAAc is increasingly being used and promoted in countries such as India to address climate policy. However, little has been done to understand this approach and its relevance in the South to help bridge the North-South divide in climate governance. I have conducted a comprehensive literature review to better understand the strengths and limitations of this method and to assess the current status of using the method in different countries across a range of disciplines. Based on my analysis, I argue that the methodology has several strengths which can help address the",495,197,0.5376884422110553,7.585028893589194,0.8827809826170588,0.0509902170720762,0.84,0.8601142857142853,0.7952007065375879,66.19249823071479,61.47738693467337,52.50026835551739

ResumenThis paper investigates the influence of climate on sea level in a coastal region of the Western Indian subcontinent, using marine sediment and coral proxies from three coastal lagoons of Goa, India. The study is based on 13 marine sediments collected during three seasons, between 2006 and 2011. A new method for reconstructing sea levels in lakelagoon basins is developed, which is calibrated on the data. It allows the detection of both long-term changes and short- term, local variability of sea - level, in response to changes in climate forcing, such as the North Atlantic oscillation, ENSO and monsoons.

Abstract
The ISO9001: 2000 is the most important and significant tool for quality management system, which is used by many organizations around the world. ISO standards help to improve organizational performance. There is no doubt about the fact that ISO can bring about a radical change in the way an organization functions. The ISO is also known as a strategic tool that can be used as an organizational change agent in order to create a change and transformation in an organisation. However in recent times there has been a decline in use of this tool. In this paper, we have tried to understand the reasons for the decline, in spite of all the success stories and the various benefits which it can provide. We have also tried in this study to identify the factors which are responsible for this decline.

Abstract. Chromolaenia odorate is a non-native tree introduced to the region as a commercial timber source. It is now a major threat to forests and agricultural fields of South and Southeast Asia and has the potential to cause major economic losses in these regions. To determine the current and future range of the invasive tree under the scenario of projected temperature and precipitation changes, a GIS-based approach has been used to predict the future geographical range. The current distribution data were collected from literature and GIS. In this study, we have considered three possible future climate scenarios. Our aim was to assess the suitability of different climatic scenarios by considering the species’ distribution. We have assessed the climatic suitability using the “Maximum Mean Difference” (“MMD”) method. A total of 12 climatic variables were used",499,184,0.53,7.495331880577403,0.8801736044646179,0.052075112345854165,0.86,0.8722727272727281,0.804468541583305,60.949113779302465,62.295,54.7394058168598

The Atlantic Multidecade Oscillation – AMO has long been hypothesized to be a driver or a modulator of the tropical atmospheric circulations. Here, we assess the role of this mode of climate variability in the summer Indian monsoonal rainfall. To assess this, our climate simulations include the AMOs and a control simulation with a prescribed AMOSc amplitude and no other climate forcing. The climate simulation is performed with the climate component Bergen model. We compare the simulated tropical climate to a multi-model ensemble of simulations performed by the CMIP6 models, which includes both the observed AMOC and AMOV, and to the historical climate. Our study shows that the simulations with",500,184,0.5393939393939394,6.928640603037555,0.8790999419551458,0.05452127775730662,0.8533333333333334,0.8289361702127663,0.7619450918997123,49.71416569257744,53.27878787878788,44.52412425644415

India’s defence budget is expected to be hiked by about 6%, to around US$ 40 billion, in the forthcoming budget session, the second major hike in as many years. This will be the seventh increase in six years, and is being done in sync with the ‘Make in India’ initiative and “strategic autonomy” in defence manufacturing.
This article is an exclusive for South Asian Defence Review
While the hike is welcome, it is also being pointed at as the reason why the country is unable to procure major defence equipment despite its huge budget size. The reason for this anomaly has been attributed to the fact that the Indian defence industry, as a whole, is still at a very nascent stage. It has not yet been given enough impetus by the government and, therefore, lacks the expertise and ability to deliver. As a result, all procurements have largely taken place with a number of foreign partners, mostly from the US, France",1,200,0.5665024630541872,8.071417672951359,0.8930450178441938,0.046351101106345154,0.855,0.8460335195530717,0.7822031890256724,56.188263036329914,58.64039408866995,50.95209895052474

India-Israel relations are at a critical juncture. The two countries have enjoyed a close defence partnership since the 1980s and are set to enter their next golden phase.
The two nations have long been strategic partners, but their relationship in recent times has been characterised by close cooperation on counter-terrorism, countering proliferation of WMDs, and joint development of new weapons systems and equipment. In 2017, the two sides signed an agreement to jointly develop a third-generation fighter jet. Israel has also been supplying India with advanced defence technology to enhance its military capabilities. India, in turn, has played an important part in Israel’s defence industrialisation efforts as it develops new platforms and weapons.

The Indian Navy and Indian Air Force have the largest fleets of fighter aircraft in the world. With a total of 1,150 aircraft, the Indian military is the fourth largest in terms of aircraft strength in Asia and Oceania after the United States of America, China and the Republic of Korea. The Indian Army is armed with a large number of tanks, artillery guns, and other equipment, making it the second largest armoured force in size in South Asia after Pakistan. In the early years of its existence, India's defence sector was mostly dependent on foreign arms imports.
However, during the Cold War era, as a result of a strong anti-proliferation policy adopted by India, there was a significant decline in India-West Germany defence cooperation. Since then, in an attempt to reduce its foreign dependency and to boost India?s military self-sufficiency, New Delhi has been attempting to acquire defence technology and weapons from several",13,192,0.5618556701030928,7.8257439289333455,0.8905607821193324,0.04783597129459522,0.8571428571428571,0.860941176470587,0.7927302542351835,59.49333333333334,66.15979381443299,60.45157657657658

This paper will discuss Jawaharlal Nehru’s idea of the Indian Defence as well as the various issues concerning it. It shall also discuss Nehrus vision for the future Indian defense force and what it could be, and how it would be able to meet the requirements of a modern day Indian state.
Jawahalarl Nehu, a freedom fighter and India’ largest prime minister, had a vision of India as an independent modern state with a strong army. The Indian army was to be the backbone of Indian foreign policy and Nehsr’ vision included a well equipped and modern army with an integrated air force, navy and missile programme. Nehrs dream of an army that stood for modern India and an Indian nation state was not achieved due to the lack of support and financial resources from the British rulers and the political instability within independent India.

In 2016, the then UPA government announced its intent to acquire 126 combat aircraft for the Indian Air Force, which has not materialised. The present government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is keen to buy more aircraft to modernise the IAF. It has also been negotiating for years with the US government for a deal to procure 24 F-16 Block 70 fighters for over USD 10 billion.

Abstract
Attrition is one of the most serious problems confronting the Indian defense forces. It has been an issue of concern for the government and for many decades there have been many initiatives launched to curb the trend of increasing attrite rate, which has not yielded results. The Indian Air Force, is an integral part of defence forces of India, the armed force is known for its strict recruitment process. But the high rate of attritions in this force has created a problem in the organization.
The purpose of this study was twofold. First, to identify the factors causing attritic in IAF and to find the solution to the problem. Second, this article will discuss the effect of emotional quotient on attritis in Indian armed forces in general. A survey of 500 I.A.F personnel was carried out by researcher and questionnaire was used.

Abstract – In the last 15 to 20 years, defence procurement in India has been characterised mainly by a large volume of imports. India's defence industry has also been unable to meet the requirements of the defence services. There is a growing perception that the procurement practices in the Indian defence forces may be contributing to an increase in defence imports, especially from the Western defence equipment suppliers. However, the issue of defence production in this country remains highly contested. The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology that will allow defence suppliers to make a better estimation on the total cost of ownership of a system. This framework will be based on life-time cost assessment",23,186,0.49214659685863876,6.801601289748763,0.8650149015489655,0.059177169606206205,0.7828571428571428,0.7988023952095812,0.7480162604782903,35.18421052631579,38.6282722513089,36.72903441363181

In the case of procurement of equipment for export, the foreign exchange is used as a source of funds to be transferred to foreign suppliers and this money is not available for other purposes.

India & Pakistan
The Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Pakistan Air force, the world’s largest and second largest nuclear armed nations, are both in need of a defence budget.
With India planning to increase its defence spending to 1.2 per cent of its GDP by 2022, Pakistan has also increased its annual defence expenditure to Rs 250 billion ($3.1 billion).
In India, this is the first time the government has earmarked Rs. 2.7 lakh crore or Rs2 lakh crores for the country’ defence needs. In a big boost to the national security, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal to hike India’ defense spending by Rs3 lakh to over Rs1 lakhcrore to strengthen the armed forces.

About India's Defence Production
The Indian defence production has evolved over a period of 5 decades into its own unique space with a strong base of private sector players that have grown along with the industry. India has been able to establish a defence ecosystem that has contributed immensely to the country' s security.
India' defense manufacturing is a key pillar of the 'Make in India'' initiative. The government has undertaken a number of steps to boost India’s indigenous defence manufacturing capabilities through the creation of necessary industrial and infrastructure facilities. With a view to develop and enhance the defense ecosystem, the government launched the Defence Industrial Park, a project aimed at creating an environment that supports the development of defence industrial clusters. It also aims at facilitating investment in defence sector, providing support for setting up of infrastructure and technology for production and exports. To this end, in 2030, India will have 1000 defence Industrial Parks in the various",34,189,0.5583756345177665,7.837175498670061,0.8897026514847708,0.04807102726447423,0.8742857142857143,0.8825433526011552,0.8075934763025719,66.80001139211666,66.98477157360406,59.833701901813356

US President Obama’s first meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was a success with the two leaders agreeing on a $5-billion defence deal, a joint statement on climate change, the Iran nuclear programme and the war on terror. The two countries announced the launch of the “US India Strategic Dialogue” to review the full range of bilateral issues as well as the regional architecture and security situation in the region and globally. They agreed to expand high-level military-to-military cooperation including the exchange of senior delegations, exchanges of military officers, joint exercises and visits by senior officials. This is the first step towards a more comprehensive defence engagement. In the next 10 years, India and US are expected to spend more than 50 times their current defence budget to reach the level of China.

It is a good idea to have an understanding of the current state of India’s armed forces, including the size of its active and reserve forces and the number of military bases in its territory, before looking at the trends in defence spending. India is the world’ s second largest defence importer. As of 2020, India spent US $69 billion on the Defence sector as per the SIPRI, (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) report. However, in the last 10 years, the country is also trying to reduce the gap in spending and has increased defence budget to 2% of GSDP. The Indian defence sector is growing steadily with the increasing demand and production of defence equipments. In this post, we will look at a 7-year period 2008-15.

The idea that is commonly understood to be India today was not the first of its kind. There have been a number of visions that the people of India, over the centuries, have had for the nation. It has been shaped by the experiences of different peoples and the ideas that they have brought to the country.
It has never been one single vision, as is the case with most countries, but several. And it is precisely because of this multiple nature that it has taken centuries for these visions to converge into an idea as we know it today. The first such vision was of Emperor Ashoka, who was one of Asia’s most enlightened leaders in history. He is also known as ‘Ashoka the Great.’
Ashokas’ vision of his country was a very inclusive one, which was in sharp contrast with what the world was at that time. His vision encompassed all the peoples that came",46,184,0.4712041884816754,6.512171447631794,0.8567356082990116,0.06280679351650598,0.8285714285714285,0.8471856287425134,0.727197139947191,37.93098591549296,44.73298429319372,44.09404821697639

In the recent years, the world has witnessed a growing phenomenon of ‘criminalisation of politics’ as a means of political oppression. The most prominent of such cases is the ongoing trial of former President of Maldives Mohamed Nasheed for the “crime” of defying the order of a military coup by his predecessor Abdulla Yameen.
Nashed’s 11 year long incarceration was a result of him (and several other opposition figures) being charged under the draconian Anti-Terrorism Act 1978, a law which has been used to silence dissent and stifle free speech throughout its tenure and in various countries around the globe. Nashed was not the only one who was persecuted by this colonial law. In fact, this anti-terror law was used by Yamaen to persecute over 100 members of the political opposition. This included Nasheeds’ close political ally and the leader of Dhivehi",50,193,0.6185567010309279,8.615497903412857,0.9088118165340473,0.039858429283001616,0.8457142857142858,0.8654117647058812,0.8177056142566823,66.28333333333333,64.0618556701031,73.48629424011104

India’s Defence Strategy
The security concerns that India faces today are more complex and challenging than ever before, and the country’ s security strategy is also being reshaped in accordance with this. This article looks at the main features of the security challenge India currently faces and what it will take for the new government to be able to successfully address these challenges.
Introduction
Since the end of colonial rule, India has been a country in transition (Majumdar 2007). This transition is a product of a number of historical factors which include a combination of factors such as its geography, demography and economic development which have shaped its security environment - a factor that has played a significant role in determining the nature of its foreign policy and national security priorities. In addition, the transition process has had a bearing on the way security issues have been addressed, with the military playing the major role. However, over the years, this has changed",56,191,0.5591397849462365,7.625649981110372,0.8887516347671056,0.04901860794243279,0.8571428571428571,0.8538271604938275,0.7938435952393944,54.25067511231131,59.483870967741936,56.741622418879054

Defence expenditure of India is one of the highest in percentage of GDP. The question whether it is really necessary for the defence of a country like India or the funds could be used for other development purposes like health, education etc. has been debated for a long time. It also needs to be looked at in the light of its effect on economic development of this country. Defence expenditure has grown at a fast pace, from 2.5% of GNP in 1960 to 7.9% in FY 2006-07. In the last decade, the ratio of defence expenditure to the GDP has increased from an average of 5.8 per cent in pre-reform period (1971-75) to an all time high of around 6.6 percent in recent years.

India’s defence expenditures had been a cause of concern for quite a long time. The government of India in the 1980′s had to face serious economic problems. There was inflation and the balance of payment position was very bad. In spite of that the defense spending increased at a rate of 9%. In the period of early 90″s India had faced a major economic crisis which resulted in a very low growth in economy, high rate inflation, a large fiscal deficit and a high current account deficit. India faced the problems of a balance payment crisis. This had a big impact on India’ s defence. At the time of the economic crises in India, it was decided to cut defense budget by 20%.
The Indian defense industry also suffered from the problem of low technology level. A large part of military hardware was imported and India also had very few defense industries.

As part of these efforts, it has become clear that more needs to be done to help companies of various sizes and types better secure their information and information networks.

It is also noteworthy that while the US is a leader in aerospace and military technology, India is nowhere near this space. For this, it would require investment of around 30 billion dollars, which India doesn’t have.

Abstract
This work aims to study and explore the role of social network in countering terrorism in Modern Indian Defence Sector. The work is based on the theoretical framework of Network Analysis, and specifically on Social Network, a sub discipline of network Analysis. In recent years, Social networks are being applied successfully in various fields of research such as, sociology, psychology, political science, business, etc. However, the application of Social network theory has not been used extensively in the area of security, defence and counter terrorism. This work focuses on social networks as a tool for identifying the network of terrorists and their supporters, for predicting the next attack, detecting the terrorists in a network and also for tracking the movement of the terrorist across different cities.
In this paper, two case studies of Indian defense are studied. Both cases are from Maharashtra and are related to the Indian Army and Indian Intelligence agency. Case study 1 focuses mainly on identifying,",76,195,0.4857142857142857,7.038668705292014,0.8649485327750082,0.05815620752581255,0.835,0.8318279569892472,0.7590896491616715,48.04122915379864,45.680952380952384,41.237682340161385

Indian Industry has come of age in the past few decades. It is an industry which is not only self-reliance, but which has also emerged as a significant player in both the domestic as well as the international arena.
In order to achieve the goal of self reliant industrial development and to promote industrial growth and development the Indian Government introduced several industrial and fiscal reforms from 1991. The main objectives of these reforms were
a) To create an atmosphere conducive to private enterprise and private entrepreneurship. b) to attract foreign investment and technology and c) the creation of a competitive domestic environment. These objectives were achieved through de-licensing, liberalisation, privatisation and the reduction of fiscal deficits. All these were implemented in a phased manner and in 2009/11 India was rated the 9th most preferred destination by foreign investors.

Introduction
The ancient hill city of Mount abhu in southern rajastahn, inda – “the mountain abode”, is situated about 150 kms south of jodhpur city. The hill is about eight k m long, rising about two thousand feet above sea level. It is one of the few hill forts to have retained its original shape and structure. A visit to the city is a journey into history with an aura of a fairyland. In the midst of this picturesque landscape is the magnificent mount Abu fort or the shah jahan fort.

In the backdrop, India's growing economy is the fastest growing among the G-20 countries and is set to become the third largest in the world by 2020. India is on the threshold of an economic transition where economic growth will accelerate to the next level. The country also stands poised to take a leadership role in global growth for the first time in its history.
While it is true that India has become a much stronger defence and strategic partner to several nations, its defence budget is still very small when compared to that of the US, Russia and China. It is therefore important that this is seen as a long-term goal, and not a short-cut. A larger defence outgo will not only have a negative impact on economic prospects but also on social and political goals of national development. This will also impact the country' s ability to meet its foreign aid commitments.

Abstract: The coasts of Western India face the problems of erosion of the beaches, which may cause loss of property and life. The beaches also provide important means of livelihood for the local populations. Coastal protection is a problem of considerable dimensions in India. However, it is still not very well understood. A study was made of three coastal areas, namely, the coast from Varkhal, near Vengurla, to Vadal, between Vennar and Terekhol Rivers. From Trivandrum, along the west coast and up to Kollam. This study is concerned with coastal geomorphology and the coastal engineering",102,197,0.547486033519553,7.324863908968972,0.8838686094078663,0.051548587056130184,0.8342857142857143,0.8056774193548382,0.7561166170637655,40.522844784727056,43.86033519553072,40.5925232244531

In his seminal work, 'Deterrence and Defence', Dr V.P. Srivastava (2003) has argued that ""the Indian concept of security is not one of an absolute defence against an external attack"". This is so because ""... India, in its quest for security, has always been a realist, and it has sought to ensure a balance of power in the sub-continent"". The author has also argued further that, since 1947, India “… has been engaged in an effort to achieve a modus vivendi with the neighbouring countries … and to seek a durable peace through dialogue”. He has gone on to say that this “peaceful policy has worked well to India’s advantage in securing her interests"".",103,199,0.5802469135802469,7.385337492392829,0.8930140056134155,0.048420578127970154,0.8866666666666667,0.8773913043478264,0.8060365636868698,67.63513873558406,73.77777777777777,63.89694976076555

[9][page needed], The right to self-defence was upheld by the Privy Council in the 1885 case of State of Bombay v. Dhirendramohan Barua.[10][11]. This was also one of the first cases to recognize the use of private force, in addition to the state's authority, to protect a person' s life and property.... and 'right of self defence' which has been given the widest scope in India. The Constitution of India has not provided any specific right for private defense, but the right of ""self-defense"".

In 2016, Singapore signed the U.S.-Singapore Joint Vision Statement on Defence Cooperation that reaffirms our shared commitment to deepen our security cooperation. As part of our efforts to strengthen our defence and security relationships with key partners, we welcomed the United States, India, Japan and China into the Singapore International Agreements Programme (SIAP), which provides a platform for Singaporeans to understand and debate international agreements that affect our country, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership [TPP] negotiations in Aukland and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in Kuala Lumpur.
These partnerships have helped to advance Singapore’s diplomatic efforts, and provide Singapore with greater insight into other countries’ views on international issues.

Abstract
Indian mustard Brassica Junce is a promising bio-fortified crop that can be utilized for the detoxication and reduction of toxic heavy metal As from contaminated water. In the current study, the role of exogenous application of various exogeneous antioxidants was assessed on growth and arsenite [As(III)] detoxifcation in mustard at the seedling stage.The exogenously applied antioxidants included, sodium selenite, vitamin E, ascorbic acid & glutathione. All the antioxidants significantly @P ≤ 0.05 increased growth, biomass production, root : shoot ratio and total root length, while reduced As accumulation in roots. The exo-application of vitamin C and asorbic Acid significantly improved the As detoxicating potential of plants, by enhancing the activities of As methyltransferases and GSH reductase respectively. Exogenous selenium also enhanced As",106,199,0.6545454545454545,8.407788596944448,0.9169959317147591,0.037431643418128865,0.8933333333333332,0.8859574468085107,0.8365458905746104,86.85877741989448,93.13333333333334,84.21987804878049

The Indian Defence forces have been in a state of near collapse for the last few years. It has been a long time since they got any significant upgrade in their equipment and weapons. There are several reasons for this. Firstly and most importantly, we are a country where there is a lot of corruption and mismanagement, which results in very low budgets and low equipment. Secondly, there are very few countries which are willing to sell us their advanced weaponry. Finally, even when we can buy weapon, our country does not give enough attention to defence.
We can see that we have a serious problem with the Indian defence forces, and we should all do something about it. Our country needs a strong defence, as our neighbours and friends are all building up their armies and navy. India needs to take advantage of this situation and start building a modern and powerful army. We can start by building",111,180,0.532608695652174,7.22465585158996,0.879199225413421,0.05333796535831585,0.8857142857142858,0.8702499999999997,0.7976955381145922,65.96823872186468,62.733695652173914,55.29268684531842

Essential Elements Of India'S Defence Offset Policy: A Critique
The Indian government' s Defence Exports Policy, 2008 was introduced on December 18,2009 in the context where the country had to deal with the aftermath of the global recession that had a devastating effect on the world economy. The policy document, as the title suggests, was aimed at boosting the Defence exports by way of offering various incentives and concessions to defence equipment vendors for their participation in India'"" Defence Procurement and Acquisition Process (dpp)"". This study examines this policy and tries to assess the extent to which it has been a success for India, by examining various facets of it such as its objective; its impact as per various parameters; the implementation of various provisions of this Policy; and, the challenges before this regime. This paper will also examine the role of Defence Industrial Development Organisation [DIDO], which is responsible",115,188,0.5945945945945946,8.087360843031885,0.900413788502988,0.04392530581137765,0.8742857142857143,0.8636024844720498,0.8243894422765228,74.20619316785451,75.34054054054054,69.78449848024317

In a landmark judgement on Wednesday, the Supreme Court of India declared the offence of rape within marriage to be a ""civil offence"" and not a crime punishable by law. The judgement, delivered by a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and B.S. Chauhan was based on a review of the provisions in the Indian Penal Code of 1860, and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013. 
The Indian Constitution, in Article 15(1), guarantees equal protection of laws to all citizens irrespective of their “creed, race, caste, sex, place of birth”, or marital status. This has been interpreted to protect all men and women, regardless of caste and creed, from all forms of discrimination, including in respect of gender. As a corollary, a woman in a marriage is protected against sexual offences committed",119,191,0.553072625698324,7.399607418244165,0.885825736146461,0.05067985451491177,0.8228571428571428,0.8283870967741945,0.7736269276435858,48.72313084112149,50.374301675977655,44.44756169212691

It is time to take stock of India'S foreign affairs. The recent visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to China, Japan and South Korea has been described as “India’s best foreign trip” by many observers. But how true is this assessment? Is the Modi government' s recent foreign tour a sign of ‘new’ India or 'old' India? The answer is: both!
In the 1980s and early 1990, India was a country with no foreign friends. It had a 100 per cent negative image and was seen as a threat to the regional security. This was the period that saw the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards, the hijack of Indian Airlines aircraft by terrorists, and bomb blasts in major cities of the country.

indian army is a disciplined force but not in the sense of an army that has been disciplined by force. this was an important lesson learnt by the defence minister when the army had to be called in after the anti-sikh riots.
this is not a force that needs to have the discipline imposed by external forces. it has its own internal system. the system is built on discipline, which is the foundation on which the other qualities can be built — qualities like self reliance, initiative and creativity. in fact this is one of the best examples of how the internal discipline can produce results that are better than the results of a discipline by a strong external force (like the british).
the discipline in this case is internal and this discipline has to emerge on its basis and not be imposed externally. there has also to a be an acceptance by all the stakeholders, particularly the leadership of that discipline. discipline is an essential",124,197,0.4479166666666667,6.206515393788477,0.8472375116015547,0.0669042202921177,0.8285714285714285,0.8211904761904759,0.7270968188147591,44.60656688710988,41.614583333333336,39.318568232662194

The humoral immune response of adult Indian river shrimp, Macrobrachiun malcomsoni to various bacterial and fungal pathogens was evaluated. A total of 14 serum samples from the 7th to 12th instars of this shrimp collected at different periods from 4 to12 weeks after hatching and from a number of different water sources were screened. The results show that a large number (70%) of serum contained antibodies that were specific for at least one of the bacterial pathogens studied. However, only a few serum ""reacted"" with two or more of them. In addition, a very low frequency of antibody production was seen against the pathogenic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium verrucosum. It may be concluded that these two shrimp serums are not useful as a diagnostic aid for the detection of bacterial or fungous pathogens.

Abstract
India has been in a constant state of flux for the past few decades. From 1947 to 2008, India has witnessed a number of social and economic changes and has gone through three major wars with Pakistan (1948; 1961; and 1971) and China [a] in 2021. This paper provides an analysis and comparison of India’s military expenditures with respect to other countries. We will also look at how India is spending its defense budget and the factors that drive its military spending. Finally, we will provide a brief comparison with other emerging and developed economies.

As part of this, India will also be able to participate in joint exercises, exchanges of personnel and joint research and development with the US. He also said that he has asked the Army chief General Bipin Rawat to look into this issue. India's defense budget in US dollar terms has more than doubled since 2002.

The Indian defence industry has been a significant beneficiary of the FDI policy of India since the 1990s. It was one of those sectors where the government permitted 100% FII / FIPB approval route for investment. This resulted in inflows of FPI from abroad and increased foreign ownership. For instance, between 2013 and 2021, FFPI - foreign portfolio funds – invested about Rs 2,50,000 crores in the Indian Defence sector.
Foreign direct investments from China are growing. Between 2004 and January 31, 2031, China’s share in Defence and Aerospace sector was 9.2%, which increased to 13.4% by April 1st,2022. China is investing in various companies in India including the Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.

In the context of the growing importance of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction and related materials the security and strategic interests of India are becoming more complex. In order to address and handle these complex and dynamic situations there is a requirement of a holistic view of security.
With the changing scenario, it is imperative that the Indian Armed Forces be made to respond in a manner in which they are able to meet the challenges of present and future scenarios. As a first step, the concept of ‘High Defence Management with Indian Characteristics’ [HDMIC), was developed. A high defence manager is the one who has a broad vision of how the armed forces should be organised, trained and equipped; and who is able and willing to provide a lead to the system to evolve and improve itself. The HDM-IC concept evolved out of an assessment of Indian needs and capabilities to ensure that India is better able than at present to deal with complex threats",137,200,0.5656565656565656,7.959493410609457,0.8922580580571382,0.046912341598469014,0.8514285714285714,0.8441379310344831,0.7792391648436605,58.6874153932461,60.474747474747474,52.13223465640846

The last article on our ""The Future of India' s Defence"" focused on Army'S future needs.This article focuses on its strengths.The Army is currently the world' most potent and powerful land force,but it is also the most technologically backward. The Army has been trying to catch up with the technology of modern warfare,in order to maintain a significant edge over the adversary in war.There are many reasons for it,like-

Abstract
This study is aimed at evaluating the impact of employee retention and training (training) practices on employee attritions / retention. The study was conducted in 4 PSUs - one in each industry i.e. 2 each in manufacturing and services sectors. A total sample size of 150 employees from each PSU were taken for the study. Data was collected through questionnaire surveys, structured interview and focus group discussion. Statistical tools used were analysis of variance, regression and t- tests, to analyse the data.
The study findings suggest that employees have positive perceptions about the training programs provided in these PSUS and also about their employer and job security is a major factor that influences employees to leave the organization. Further it is also observed that training is one of the important tools in retaining good employees and the PSIs which provide training to their employees tend to be more productive as compared to those who do not provide trainings",147,189,0.5751295336787565,7.9899548333105095,0.8948902618742871,0.04598866880802219,0.88,0.8849704142011835,0.8009084778481015,58.3875539125077,63.89119170984456,66.6843910382945

The government has recently initiated a process to restructure the defence sector. This has come at a time when the armed forces are facing a severe shortfall in their operational requirements. The restructuring has been proposed in two parts: in the first, the army is to be separated from the other three services, which would then be reorganised, and the second is the setting up of a new defence industrial base, including a private manufacturing sector in defence.
In a recent article in Foreign Policy, Mani Shankar Aiyar writes that ""the government is planning a restructuring of India’s defence industries which it sees as critical to India's security and prosperity"". The first step is in setting out to separate the Indian army and other services and make it a separate ministry. A new ministry would have “a more focused mandate for defence production, procurement and security of supply of weapons and ammunition"".

The Indian armed forces are among the few in the world that are able to develop indigenous military hardware, weapons, and platforms to meet current and future challenges. These systems are critical assets for the nation, which are developed by the DRDOs of India.
A quality management system is necessary in such an environment to ensure the quality of products and process outputs, thus enabling the development of a strong and efficient industrial base for defence and security. However, a recent study by a reputed consulting firm found that only 20 out of 120 DRDos and defence PSUs have implemented and/or certified to an ISO 9001 quality standard. This paper is an attempt to analyse this issue in greater detail and suggest possible solutions for it.

This device is made from the body' s own cells and can be used to make batteries for your car, laptop charger, etc.. I am sure that there are many ways to harness this power and make them into something useful, like making batteries.

In the late 1970s, the Indian government decided that India’s security required an independent nuclear deterrent. The decision to acquire a nuclear weapons stockpile came after a series of incidents in which India was forced to rely on other countries to defend it from Pakistani nuclear attacks.
At the time, there were few options for India. India did not have the financial resources to develop its own nuclear technology, nor was India capable of building nuclear warheads without the help of an outside country. This was due to the fact that a significant percentage of the country’’ military equipment was manufactured in the United States at the end of World War II, making India reliant on Washington. In addition, India relied upon American technology to help develop nuclear weaponry. Finally, since the 1950’’, India had maintained an agreement with the U.S to buy its nuclear fuel. It was the combination of these three things that made India unable to build its first nuclear bombs.

About the Project:
The aim of this project is to understand the evolution and current status of Indian aerospace sector and the policies that have supported it over its life span. The project will look at various policy interventions and how these have impacted the industry and its evolution. It will focus on a particular period (1996-2015) which will allow us to look back and see how it evolved from a defence-oriented industry to a largely civilian and private sector dominated industry. As a result of its transformation the aerospace and defence industry is no more in the radar of policy makers.

Abstract
Aphids, pests of major crops, can reduce crop yields by more than 50%. The present study was conducted in the laboratory on Vethalaikizhangu,a native of South Africa.

Abstract
The present paper presents a novel approach to build a semantic annotated text corpus, based on a large number of documents, for the purpose of developing a classifier that can be used to classify the text documents based upon their semantics. The annotated data set consists of a set of defense related articles which are classified as positive/negative and a manually curated corpus based from a corpus mining tool. These two corpora are further used for building the semantic annotated corporal for use in a machine learning algorithm for developing an accurate classifier. In the present study, we use the LSI based approach for feature selection to select the relevant features to be considered while training the model and then, used a Random forest classifier to develop the classifier for both the corporals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperformed a number approaches used in the literature.",166,193,0.515625,7.144709581221619,0.8740131041451173,0.05517751852935216,0.8457142857142858,0.8397619047619052,0.7783143620576419,51.8858367826315,55.526041666666664,49.459325650874945

by Ananth Krishnan – The Indian Defence Review
A ballistic missile (or ballistic rocket).
The missile’s warhead is a nuclear, chemical, or biological payload that may be either conventional or nuclear.
Missiles can be classified by their method of propulsion. Missiles that are propelled by jet engines, rockets, and other chemical or mechanical reactions are known as ballistic missiles. Ballistic missiles have a range and payload capability that exceeds that of cruise missiles and bombers. They have been used in military conflicts since the 1950s, most notably in the Cold War era during the nuclear standoffs between the Soviet Union and the United States. The development of these missiles led both sides to devote large amounts of resources to developing countermeasures..

Abstract
With the introduction of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in the 21st century, navigation has become an important aspect in warfare. GNSS is a technology that provides highly accurate position and time information to the users and the military. The GNSSL - based positioning system provides accurate location information within centimetre level of precision over a large area within minutes of time, which is critical for navigation. In addition, GNSPL also helps to track the movements of objects within its range. Since GNPS is based on radio signals it can be easily jammed, disabled or destroyed.
The research work is to review the current GNSA capabilities of the country and assess the impact in case of any GNPA/GNPS failure on the operational capabilities and its potential impact on India. A review of various GNPPL systems available in other countries has been performed",174,186,0.6,8.049844718999243,0.9016310671484934,0.04361731570305321,0.8857142857142858,0.8933333333333332,0.8233141712925921,79.84198645598195,75.81111111111112,73.66932744565217

This initiative was initiated in the year 2006 and now has evolved as an effective instrument of security cooperation and peace-building in this region of critical importance for India and its Central
Asia. The ICADCs aim to contribute to peace, security and stability in a region where these are most needed.

India-Israel relations have taken a new turn in the wake of US President Barack Obama’s visit to India in July 2010. In fact, it was this visit that provided the impetus to the strategic cooperation between the two countries that is now at the peak of its development. Since then, Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and his Israeli counterpart Binyamin Netanyahu have met on several occasions.
It was in this backdrop that in February this year, the first India-Israeli Defence Industry Conference was held in New Delhi, with the participation of a delegation led by Israel Defence Minister Ehud Barak and the head of the Ministry of Science and Technology and Space of India, Vilasrao Deshmukh, who is also a member of Prime Ministers Council on Defence, Security and Strategic Affairs.

Indian defense,"the reunion of the church, revised edition: a defence of the south india scheme","the reunion of the church, revised edition: a defence of the south india scheme of church polity – (bible commentaries) by c.s. johnstone —
In the last few days of December I had the pleasure of reading The Reunion of The Church. It’s a slim volume (~ 130 pages) published in India in 1952 and has recently been revised and reprinted in a limited edition. The book is by a Scottish Presbyterian minister, C. S. Johnstone, and is a very thorough and clear statement of an alternative model for ecclesiology for Reformed churches, particularly Presbyterian churches.
A few thoughts on the book:
- Johnstones’ thesis is very much a product of his time (“Church and Kingdom” is an expression that dates him). But the principles that Johnston outlines are not dependent on his particular theological or ecclesiastical commitments. They are sound and can be adopted by churches in many theological traditions. I am not an Arminian or an anti-Calvinist,",189,199,0.5531914893617021,7.5849795578905175,0.886936383924207,0.04971669671584159,0.8457142857142858,0.8714634146341464,0.8022271456072042,66.99573556179993,65.05851063829788,63.133219834007235

But in the coming decade, the pandemic will likely have its own effect. It is clear that the covid has highlighted some of the world' nations' - most notably the US – weaknesses and exposed its fragility in many areas.

1.1 Introduction
In the contemporary era ‘defense spending’ has been a matter of serious debate. While some argue that defense spending should increase to keep up with the ever increasing threat of terrorism, others believe that spending more on defense can be counterproductive and lead to a situation where defense budget is used for purposes other than defence like development of infrastructure etc. and the economy is not benefited.
Defence spending is also a source of concern for many developing countries like India, which has to balance the need for modernization of its military to meet the rising security challenges posed by China and Pakistan. It has a huge population and its defence forces are one of the largest in the world.

It is suggested that Indian policy makers have adopted the policy of'minimum credible nuclear deterrence' and have moved towards the deployment, development and testing of strategic missiles with a view to enhancing the credibility of the deterrences. Further, the missile defense is likely to be deployed in India with the aim of enhancing deterrent capability of its nuclear posture in a regionally unstable and unpredictable environment.",204,188,0.5630252100840336,6.141879930089016,0.8798041367735047,0.05791045226259453,0.8400000000000001,0.8442105263157903,0.7557515896533614,49.36961206896552,49.89915966386555,46.840725806451616

India's military and defence equipment procurements are a long-standing problem. They are fraught with corruption, delays, inefficiencies, and lack of oversight. The Indian defence forces need to address these issues.
The Indian government is in a hurry to increase the defence procurement process to keep up with domestic demands. India is the world'S third-largest defence spending nation after the United States and China; but, it is still a distant third, with less than $50 billion in defence procuremets in 2008. In 2015, India' s defence budget has reached ~$46 Billion, the country is expected to be third largest military budget in the next few years. As a result of India’s large population and a rapidly growing economy, demand for military equipment and services is growing rapidly.

The Indian Defence Industry has come a long away from the times when it was considered as an afterthought. The Indian Government is now giving it priority, by setting up the Defence Acquisition Council in 2001, and has made a series of policy announcements and measures in the last decade which have helped the industry. However, much more can be done for it, in terms of making India self-reliant, which will not only save valuable foreign exchange, but also make the country’s military more potent. This is especially so in view of the growing strategic competition with China and its allies, as well as the continuing terrorist threat from across the border in Jammu and Kashmir. A strong defence industrial base is the only way to meet the threats of today.

The newly appointed Defence Secretary, Dr. Ajit Kumar Chaudhary, needs to be congratulated for his appointment to the post. This, in itself, is a significant change in the country. The change from a non-military person to someone with a military background to head the Defence Ministry is important. It indicates that the military will be taken into account more seriously and that this department will get more respect in national decision-making.
It is, however, important to note that while Dr Chaurdhary comes with military experience, he also has extensive knowledge of civil administration. That is also important, as we need to ensure that civil and military administration work in harmony.

The budget allocation for defence for this year was Rs 2,95,000 crore. It is not the first time that the minister has spoken about the constraints on the budget. In December 2021, in response to a question in Lok Sabha, he said: “Our budget is Rs. 6 lakh crore … We cannot spend that 100 %. It can be spent up to 70 or 80 percent, which we have done.

The first step towards the development of an indigenous capability is the establishment of a defence industrial base, including the manufacturing and assembly of arms and armaments. The Indian government has been pursuing an ambitious “Make In India” policy to encourage domestic defence production and reduce dependence on foreign defence firms.. In the 1950s and 60s, India's defence requirements were supplied by indigenous manufacturers such as the Aircraft Factory at Nasik. This will enable India to build its own defence infrastructure and capabilities, rather relying on the foreign suppliers for the entire spectrum of military requirements. It was also felt that in the long term, such an arrangement with Russia would enable Indian firms to acquire the requisite technology to produce sophisticated weaponry. A large number of countries around the world are seeking to modernise their Armed Forces through the acquisition of the best available technology.

The study was aimed to identify the potential sources of stress in the field conditions and to understand the role of antioxidant defense in alleviating the stress conditions on three traditional rice cultivars of Jeypure region of Odisha. For the study, three land races of rice namely, Kshamal, Pundari, and Khandia were subjected to different types of abiotic environmental stresses such as salinity, drought, high temperature, submergence etc. The results of the present study revealed that the landrace Khamal showed the highest yield under drought stress condition, followed by Punda and khandi.

Indian defense,martial law and the defence of constitutional order in india,"martial law and the defence of constitutional order in india: a critical analysis of the concept of 'external emergency' under the indian constitution (2005-2007)
Abstract
The Indian Constitution has provisions to address the issues which may threaten the very existence of India. Such issues arise due to a threat to national security, war or external aggression against the State. A ""Constitutional Emergency"" is a state of law wherein the provisions of Constitution are suspended. This study is concerned with the issue of martial law which is defined in article 352 of Indian constitution. The concept and provisions relating to martial laws have been analysed in the article and it has been observed that the Indian military can be deployed in any area of country under certain circumstances.

The Indian Ballistic Missile Defense System (IBMDS) is being developed to address a wide range of potential strategic threats to India. The IBMDS is expected to include a space segment, a ground segment and a command and control element.
In this paper, I argue that while the development of the IBMD is a welcome step towards Indian self reliance and strategic autonomy, the Indian government'a decision to base the missile defense system on Israeli technology is not the optimal choice available. I also contend that given the political drivers behind the current development, India is more likely to use this missile defensive capability to deter and contain regional actors, and the Pakistani response to this could be asymmetrical nuclear threats.",224,188,0.6283783783783784,7.644552909699114,0.9070256064465932,0.04284017586168714,0.9120000000000001,0.8841935483870969,0.8082771101032983,80.9485621709194,76.00675675675676,62.864579606440074

India’ s military and security forces were stretched to their limit in 2019, with the number of terror attacks rising and a border conflict with China continuing despite diplomatic efforts to find a solution.
But, despite the challenges, the armed forces and intelligence agencies have made significant progress in their efforts at protecting India’ military, strategic and economic interests. They have also developed a new mindset and have begun to think of themselves as partners of the country's development and progress.

Indian defense,indian defence expenditure: 1872-1967,"indian defence expenditure: 1872-1967: a critical survey of the literature
The main aim of this study is to present a survey and a critique of literature on defence spending published during the first three decades of independence in India. This is done with the help of a detailed analysis of some 300 references to the “defence expenditure” and allied matters. The data are arranged according to time, topic, author and source. These data and the analysis are presented for the period 1860-1947.
A number of conclusions and observations, in general, are drawn from the survey. One is that there is little agreement among the authors as to how the defence budget should be measured. Some have taken the budget estimates of defence ministries, whereas others have used the estimates made by various agencies. There is no unanimity on how these budgets should reflect the reality of military preparedness, the actual expenditure on the army and other forces, and their relative importance to other sectors and services in the economy.

The Indian government is expanding its defence cooperation with other countries while at the same time it struggles to increase local manufacturing.
New Delhi: The Indian defence industry, already struggling with a lack of investment and expertise, has been further hampered by the government’s push for indegenisation, which has led to a decline in foreign arms exports since 2015, according to government data reviewed by., the research arm of The Wall Street Journal. The country is in talks with several countries for potential arms deals, but none of them will result in a major purchase. And while the number has increased from $ 3.4 billion in 12 years ago, it has fallen 40 percent since a peak in March 2021. In fact, India has not made a single arms deal to another country since March.

Indian defense,policy for india's defence,"policy for india's defence
The government of India has a long-term policy, which is to build a strong military and defense industry in the country so that India can be self dependent on defense production.
This is the ""Indian Defence Production (IDP)"" programme. This programme was first announced in 1940, by the then prime minister of Independent India, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. The aim was to make India totally self-reliant on the manufacture of defense products and systems. It was a very ambitious plan, as at that time, there were no manufacturing industries for defense goods in India. In 1957, the programme became a law in parliament. Since then, this law and many others have enabled the government and armed forces to procure defense equipment from India-based industries. However, since India is a big country, with a large population, and with many different regions, climates and terrains, it is difficult to equip all parts of the nation equally.

The purpose of this article is to explore the post conflict defence reform process in India after the 2001 Gujarat riots. The Gujarat riot was a major turning point in the Indian security establishment as it led to significant changes in defence policy and reforms. While it is widely acknowledged that post the Gujarat violence the government of India took a more proactive approach towards defence planning, the manner in which it has been implemented remains a matter of debate and criticism. This paper examines the nature of post – Gujarat reforms and highlights the limitations of the reforms that have emerged. These include the lack of strategic vision and the failure of institutional reforms at the level of military and civilian leadership.
It is important to note the role of political leadership in implementing reforms, as defence is essentially a political subject. Political leadership is critical in driving the change that the defence forces and defence industry require to meet the growing security needs. It is also important as the armed",230,186,0.5050505050505051,7.106690545187015,0.8708278457306402,0.05624335441538624,0.84,0.8475862068965526,0.7514136761259087,53.26804002630838,49.57575757575758,47.238565488565484

Abstract
The human microbiome plays a significant role in maintaining health, and its disruption can cause chronic diseases. The intestinal mucosal barrier is essential for maintaining a balance between the host and the microbial community. However, chronic colonic inflammation has been linked to the development of ulceration, a pathological state of colons that is accompanied by the loss of epithelial cells. Colonic ulcerations are a common complication of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and are frequently accompanied in IBDs. Ulcerations in the large intestine are associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species. These reactive species may be a potential contributor to ulcer formation in inflammatory diseases, such as IBD and colite, because these conditions are accompanied with chronic oxidative and inflammatory status. Furthermore, the antioxidant system of the body protects cells from harmful",232,185,0.5875706214689266,7.81711869122942,0.8972674940050391,0.04570005681661267,0.8799999999999999,0.8635294117647063,0.8084515780323865,66.70292580862764,66.38418079096046,52.833977011494255

Abstract
Background: L.theobroamae is a pathogen of tea causing leaf brown spots and black leaf blight. In this study, the effect of benzathiazol (benzothaizole) as an inducer of phenylalanyl-amino acid 5-aminolaevulinate lyase [PAL(5AL)], a rate-limiting enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis, was examined using the gene promoter of PAL(T). The PAL induction was used to improve flavanol biosynthetic pathway in the plants by the introduction of exogenous PAL gene.
Results: In the present study it was shown that benzthiazolone at 1 mg/ml concentration increased PAL 4-fold. Expression of gene PAL was found to be up-regulated by benzolthiadine in a dose dependent manner. A maximum of 7-folds higher expression was observed when the cells",236,194,0.6352201257861635,8.009821015753255,0.910476965577647,0.04066646287184001,0.8933333333333332,0.8823703703703705,0.8235797096890655,80.46951219512195,80.0754716981132,65.83425797503467

the global transfer of high-technology is one of the most sensitive issues in international trade. the international transfer to the developing countries of such high technology is a matter of great concern because the developed countries want to prevent the diffusion of this technology to their adversaries. however, the transfer is an inevitable consequence of a free-market economy. therefore, to understand the nature of international technology transfer in the world it is necessary first to know the basic structure of world economy and the forces which act upon the technology in different countries. it must be noted that the total amount of transfer varies from country to country depending upon its technological strength and economic condition.
in the present world the main players are the u.s., the european nations, japan, and some countries like the korea and singapore. there has been a shift from the western world to some extent to east asian countries, particularly japan and korean in technology. but, in general, western countries retain their dominance",240,195,0.4975369458128079,7.088810304070324,0.8686131377262313,0.056939149673508695,0.835,0.8344134078212296,0.7354733988733572,41.55032509752926,43.20197044334975,39.86223674655047

the report said, ""there is a need to develop a coherent defence industrial base that can support the indigenous arms and armour industry as well as the defence services. to achieve this, it is vital that policy makers develop an integrated approach to the development of indigenous defence production that includes a clear vision, strong leadership, an appropriate legislative framework, and an efficient financial architecture. this will be crucial to building the capacity to design and manufacture complex military equipment and systems.""
it is in that context, the report has proposed a ‘defence manufacturing policy' and a detailed roadmap, which includes the following:
· a national manufacturing vision statement for defence that is linked to national security goals;

the indian law on arbitration is governed by the arbitration and conciliation act 1996[1], which was replaced by indian code of civil procedure in 2013[2]. arbitration, in india, can be either private, as in the case of a dispute between the parties, where they mutually consent to settle the dispute by one or more neutral arbitrators or public, when the government or the state orders the settlement of disputes by means of arbitration[3].
in the former, the courts can intervene only if there are irregularities in arbitral proceedings. in public proceedings however, it is the court’s responsibility to check on the fairness, transparency and impartiality of arbitrations. the supreme courts of india in various cases have emphasised that arbitration in such instances is not private. for example in reliance industries ltd. v shree ram sharma[4] and in re: reliance petroleum l.t.d. / reliance international petroleum[5",247,199,0.5520833333333334,7.6498910667625415,0.8870077411620069,0.049486356604007846,0.84,0.8292857142857143,0.7735705476163512,53.0918885782488,55.125,45.91974548440066

The article also highlights some of key issues, the review committee has identified and is seeking to improve upon under the revised DPD. This article does not seek to examine the issues and recommendations raised by other stakeholders, in the past, including the Comptroller and Auditor General of India – who had raised a series of important issues in 2011, that continue to be important.

Foreign Direct Investment
In defence, FDI may have two types of benefits in the form of technological transfer and market share.
(1) Technological transfer: In a joint venture, the transfer of technology would be the prime attraction. The foreign partner may provide technology, which may not be available in our country. It also facilitates joint development of new products. (2) Market share: FPI may seek market expansion and may invest in production to gain market position. FFPI can also seek investment to meet the growing demand of the market
Problems:
The problem is that FIP may be used by foreign countries to obtain sensitive information about their military hardware.

Abstract
The Indian Ballistic Missile Defence [BMD] project is a response to the growing nuclear threat from China. It was launched after the Pokhran-II nuclear tests by China in 1995 when there was a serious concern that the Chinese nuclear arsenal was expanding at a much faster pace than the Indian nuclear deterrent. BMD was envisaged to protect the country from such Chinese threats and to maintain the nuclear deterrence capability. The project envisions a three-layered BSD architecture which is primarily aimed at intercepting short-to-medium range missiles. This thesis examines the implications of India’s BMS on regional and global strategic balance. To this end, the research will",272,184,0.6407185628742516,8.279908588115264,0.9130196334206511,0.039132461431052944,0.8733333333333334,0.8855944055944055,0.8343541949749484,96.97407110303408,90.39520958083833,70.45719696969697

The India-Japan Ballistic Missile Defence cooperation has taken many turns. The most noteworthy is the fact that Japan’s request for an early warning system was turned down by India citing a clause in the Missiles Technology Control Regime (MTCR) that India is a member of. In 2011, Japan had requested India to join the US-UK-Australia MTCS, as a non-nuclear member – this was again declined. India then sought to have a more ‘flexible’ understanding of the MCCR by allowing Japan to access information from the Indian radars, which would in turn allow Japan, to develop its own missile detection systems, and not be dependent on the information provided by the United States. However, this has been rejected by both India and the U.S [1].

Here, we present an update of this study, including a more sensitive micro array technology. - For the analysis, the expression data of 11 white-mustard cultivars, of which seven resistant and four susceptible to Alterna- tiona Brassicae- cola were used as experimental material. For each individual sample, two replicates were performed, one with and one without pathogen challenge. The results were validated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR.

- The rupees decline was a consequence of high oil and commodities prices, high capital inflows, a large external account deficit and a rising current account gap. These are the reasons for the rupees fall, but the question which arises is why has the dollar appreciated. Is the appreciation a result of higher demand and supply of currencies. The answer is not quite correct, for it is the demand for dollars that causes appreciation of dollar and vice versa. This is because dollar is used as a benchmark for pricing commodity prices. It is therefore, the increase in demand of commodities for which the price has increased. In other words it means that there was more demand. As a currency it has its value. And the more the value of a particular currency, it will be more attractive for foreign investors and traders. So as we know that the higher the values the lesser is its cost",275,182,0.45263157894736844,6.239095750946101,0.8489283134581485,0.06629575329192372,0.8114285714285714,0.8077108433734937,0.7159591570830868,41.926859028751394,39.86842105263158,35.922054895459155

The Indian Army, like the Indian Navy and the Air Force, is a professional organisation. Its recruitment process is governed by the Defence Services (Entry Procedure) Rules. These were notified under Section 57 of the Army Act, 1950, which is the basic law governing the recruitment and training of officers and gentlemen in the army. The rules were made by a committee of senior army officers who were entrusted with the task by General V.C. Deshmukh, the then Chief of Army Staff. It is pertinent to note that these rules do not contain any provision for recruiting persons of Indian Scheduled Castes or Schedules Tribes. This paper seeks to examine the issue of recruitment of Sched Caste and Sched Tribe personnel and its impact on jointmanship.

The Chinese and Indian economies are the fastest growing in Asia.
They are also the most populous, largest and richest countries in that
region. They are therefore natural partners for a stable and prosperous
Asia. China and India have an old friendship. This friendship was
renewed by the historic visit of the first Chinese Premier, Mr Zhao
Zhuangang to India in 1979. The ""special relations"" that have evolved
between the two countries over the years have been marked by
frequent high-level exchanges between the leaders, close political and

The Indian Army is currently engaged in Operation ‘Rahat’ in Jammu and Kashmir against terrorist organizations, the most important of which is Pakistan’ Army’ sponsored Lashkar-eTaiba. It is widely believed that Lashakeraida and Pakistan are behind the attack on Indian military personnel in Uri. This is the first attack by terrorists in Indian territory on the Indian security forces since the Kargil conflict in 1999. The attack was a clear message to India that Pakistan-based terrorist groups were still active on India soil and had not given up the use of terror to achieve their objectives.

Abstract
The India-Australia Security and Defence Relationship, as it has developed over a period of 60 plus years, was discussed in this paper. The paper began by reviewing the history of Indo-Australian Defence Relations, with particular reference to post 1990. In the first 30 years of bilateral relations, Australia had been a major provider of military assistance to India, particularly following Independence in 1947. However, after 1972, when India's relations with the USA were normalised, the bilateral military ties began to deteriorate as Australia became a close ally of the US and its military links with India diminished. Following the end of India?s nuclear tests in May 2008, Indo Australian bilateral defence ties were revived and the relationship has grown steadily. Australia has now become one of key",283,181,0.5617977528089888,7.495316889958614,0.8887229930182067,0.0494472173494836,0.8971428571428571,0.8981818181818189,0.7979238298284013,67.30763524611879,66.33707865168539,62.10405927835052

• ""What is the scope for EU-India defence relations?""
This question is addressed through a historical overview of Indo-European relations. In addition, it is assessed whether the current level and scope of the EU's involvement in the military domain, in comparison to other international organisations (NATO, OSCE, ASEAN) is appropriate. It is argued that the European Union – India strategic partnership is a good basis to further improve the defence dimension of EU engagement with India.
2. EU’s approach and engagement in defence and security cooperation
The European security and defence policy has been developed in an incremental fashion and is characterised by three phases. The first phase 1999-2003 focused on civilian and police aspects. From 2004 and on, the security dimension has become increasingly important. At present, a more holistic approach to security is under development. This includes a wider scope and a stronger political focus on security",288,199,0.5404040404040404,7.604158883350106,0.8836219516411599,0.05067262257133251,0.8457142857142858,0.8487356321839076,0.7946718411505218,54.70209316448362,54.01010101010101,53.5186974789916

INDIA TO HELP IRAN BUILD NUCLEAR REACTOR:
India is expected to assist Iran in building a nuclear power reactor in Bushehr, in a move designed to boost bilateral ties.
Iran and Russia signed an inter-governmental agreement for building the Bussehr nuclear facility on Tuesday. Iran would supply Russia with enriched uranium for 15 years. In return, Russia would build the nuclear reactor and train Iran’s nuclear technicians.

Abstract
India and Russia have had a long history of bilateral relations, which has been marked by a mix of cooperation and competition in areas spanning a range of interests. This research aims at studying the bilateral security partnership between India and Russian Federation during ‘India-Russia Summit 2018’ with a focus on the economic and security dimensions of this partnership. In particular, this study is an attempt to analyze the nature and scope of the Indo -Russian defense and military cooperation, the role played by the defense industries in the development of military technologies, security challenges that India faces and the security concerns of New Delhi with regard to Russia. The study also examines the extent of strategic cooperation between the 2 countries in economic sectors other than the defence sector.

Part I
India has been a “strategic pivot” — an important part of US military plans in Asia-Pacific. The US has spent over USD 100 billion in arms purchases since President Obama took office, and India is now its top recipient of arms, accounting for a fifth of its total arms deals. But the Indian military remains under-equipped, underpaid, ill-prepared and underfunded.
This article is based on the findings of a year-long study – ‘India: The Strategic Military Pivot in the Asia Pacific’ -- which was commissioned by the Centre for the National Interest in Washington DC. It is a joint project of Observer Research Foundation’s Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi and the United States India Policy Institute of George Washington’ s Elliott School of International Affairs.

This paper deals with the issue of battered woman syndrome and battered wife's defence in Indian law, especially after the introduction of the Criminal Law amendment bill (2010).

It also discusses the difficulties in establishing the battered women syndrome by looking at the relevant provisions and their interpretations by different Courts of law and the possible reasons there for.

The US has long been seen as the ‘poster child’ of the liberal international order, which seeks to create a rules-based international system, promote liberal values, and maintain peace and security. This vision has been largely supported by US allies and allies-in-arms in Europe, North America and Asia. But the US-India alliance has become a test case for this vision in recent times. The two countries are seen by many as natural partners in the quest for global liberalism, with their shared values of democracy, pluralism and secularism underpinning their respective visions. However, the relationship has not always been an easy one. In fact, it has seen some of its worst days since the end of World War II. And the challenges have become even more acute in this post-pandemic era.

Description
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of the defence innovation and technology ecosystems (DITEEs) in China and India to understand the factors that have enabled them to grow as strong technology powerhouses. It identifies the key elements and best practices that India could learn and leverage from China in order to develop a strong domestic defence ecosystem that will be able to support the growing aspirations of its defence and security sector. The study also provides recommendations to the Indian government for creating an enabling environment that would encourage more private sector participation and facilitate innovation in defence.

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors behind the recent rapid growth of defence-related cooperation between the United States and India. Using a case analysis approach, the paper argues that the main factors that led the two countries to engage in a closer defence relationship are their common interests in maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific regional security environment, and their shared concern that China has a rising power in the region. The paper concludes with recommendations for the next US administration on how to continue and expand this cooperation.",299,189,0.6301369863013698,7.613974175141785,0.9073325646033857,0.04281530858009208,0.8720000000000001,0.8577049180327877,0.8095817764802805,73.77935943060498,73.77397260273973,56.49958228905597
Indian defense,india's defence budgeting: lessons not learnt,"india's defence budgeting: lessons not learnt
In the wake of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, India' is expected to increase its defence budget by around 10.7%.
The rise is a direct result of growing security concerns, and the realisation that the Indian military is ill -equipped to deal with the threats to national security.
However, while this may seem logical, there are many who are sceptical of how effective the additional funds will be, particularly in the context of a large military establishment, which consumes the lion' s share of budgetary allocations. In fact, according to a report prepared by an NGO, a third (33 %) of India ’s annual budget of Rs 1,20,000 crores is currently spent on the armed forces, with only 7 % of these funds being used for modernisation. The rest are used to pay for salaries and pensions, maintenance of military equipment and infrastructure",300,187,0.6242774566473989,8.21108794971282,0.9085709863814767,0.040852158269083574,0.8999999999999999,0.8885906040268459,0.8059635184968255,83.08111806657234,84.10982658959537,80.65940454893943

Defence Offset is the mechanism under which the Indian government encourages foreign vendors to set up facilities in India for the manufacturing of defence equipment and components. It was introduced as a policy to encourage the development of India’s defence manufacturing capabilities, to provide employment in the defence industrial sector by leveraging the strengths of domestic industries and to promote defence exports in order to achieve self-reliance in military equipment.
In 2007, the Cabinet decided that all offset contracts for equipment procured by the armed forces would be made mandatory with the offset obligations being incorporated into the contract. The Offset Policy - 2015 provides the basis of implementation of this provision. Offset obligations are mandatory in case of foreign defence acquisition, and voluntary if the procurement is from a domestic vendor. As per the Offset policy, all the offsets contracts are required to be registered with Ministry of Defence. Further, offsets are to cover manufacturing activities, research and development and services.

This dissertation will examine the impact of Tibet in the 21st Century on the defence, foreign, and security interests of India. Tibet has historically been a significant factor in determining India’s position and interests in China and the world. The ‘Tibet Card’ that the Indian government can play in order to achieve its ends in South Asia and beyond has been in decline since the end of the Cold War. China is now a major world power with global interests and a large, modern military and has emerged as a strategic rival to India as well as the rest of Asia.
In particular, Tibet serves as an example of how the Chinese Communist government uses a policy of ""strategic reassurance"" to manage foreign relations with countries around the globe and to protect its interests at home and abroad. This policy has become the norm in international relations. It is a strategy that seeks to establish China as “a responsible power, a partner",306,192,0.5153061224489796,7.214285714285714,0.8743880750620311,0.05479838247898555,0.8628571428571429,0.8627906976744182,0.7814788070006389,58.56135782163743,61.90816326530612,55.86077558804831

India has been an exporter of military technology for a long time, but in recent times it has taken a different turn towards imports of defence technology. With the advent of economic reforms in 1990s India started to import a lot of arms from the western world.
In 2000, the government started the Defence Acquisition Process which was aimed to develop the Indian Defence Industrial base with the assistance of the private sector. This was also aimed at making the defence procurement process transparent and efficient so that India can become self-sustaining in the field of Defence.

“Defence imports, especially arms, is not a matter of national pride for us. They are the result of our past. We must be able to produce our own arms,” he said.
Asked whether the import of arms would not go down in case of peace, the minister said the country was ‘still in transition to achieve peace’.
When asked whether India was in talks with Russia to buy the advanced S-400 Triumf air defence system, Mr Singh, who was here for the second day of the India-Russia summit, said talks were on. “We have a very important military relationship with them.”

Abstract
This paper aims to analyse the price volatility for defence sector stocks traded on the Indian stock exchange by using Bollinger Band (BB). A simple volatility analysis model has been developed for this study. The paper uses daily closing prices for the selected stocks from January 2000 to March 2010. It has also been observed that the BB bands are wider in the bull market conditions as compared to bear market condition. This is evident from the higher standard deviation during bull phase.

India is a vast country with a population of more than 120 crores. It is the 2nd largest populated country in the world, with the largest youth population in 10 of the countries in Asia. India has many security threats and challenges. There is an urgent imperative for a paradigm shift in India’s defence policy. The existing security environment is very complex and dynamic.

India [ ]. In the s, Britain's hold on India was slipping. In, the Indian National Congress, which had long agitated in India for more democracy and home rule under British rule, had begun calling for the British Raj to leave. The transfer to Indian control was completed in August of that year and India' s independence was declared on August 15th,

Abstract
This paper presents a case for use of convenience foods based upon a traditional Indian diet to provide nutritional adequacy at reduced costs of food preparation for the defence personnel. It was found that the diet of an Indian soldier based primarily upon rice, lentils, vegetables and pulses, supplemented with milk and eggs, provided all essential nutrients with minimal cost. These foods could easily be prepared in the kitchen and consumed in their traditional format or as processed foods, and were found to have similar nutritive value and cost effectiveness when compared with the present food items in use. The cost per kilogram of nutrients was calculated and compared to the",320,185,0.5517241379310345,7.277741218357472,0.8847255799259921,0.05144917933063367,0.8466666666666667,0.8600000000000002,0.7950168487891662,57.560448594978595,63.206896551724135,61.78820775998196

The Indian Defence budget for 09- 10 has received considerable attention, both
in the media, and in the blogosphere for the increase over last years allocation,
as well as for some of the key items.
While the 08-09 allocation of Rs 1.04 lakh crore ( 2.8 % of GDP) was an increase
of 15.3 %, the current allocation is an addition of nearly 20 %. This increase has
been possible primarily because of a significant jump in military spending from
Rs 75,000 crore in 06-07 to Rs. 97,900 crore this year. While the allocation for
capital expenditure in FY-2008 was Rs, 71,500 crore,",328,181,0.5714285714285714,7.091242083423347,0.8888979444302765,0.05078903002447464,0.8266666666666667,0.8310769230769233,0.7833962773542491,51.85848252344417,52.44155844155844,42.845027515723274

Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between defence spending, economic activity and per-capita income for India and Pakistan. The study uses a panel data analysis with fixed effects model. Using the panel dataset of 1995-2013, the findings of this study provide support for the ‘crowding out’ effect of defence expenditure (i.e., the negative impact that increased defence budget has on the private sector). This means that a 1% increase in defence spend reduces per capita income by 0.1%. This relationship is found for both India, and for Pakistan, even though the former has higher economic output. Further, this result is robust to different sample specifications and estimation techniques. This result holds for all the sub-periods and all specifications examined. It is argued that",331,187,0.5621621621621622,7.6462320697756,0.8896694123473259,0.04866441578750215,0.8514285714285714,0.8633540372670807,0.8080932446313072,61.666666666666664,62.31891891891892,62.60035052012664

A few days after the announcement by Mr. A.B. Vajpayee of his Government' decision to increase the defence outlay of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, the Finance Minister, has stated in his budgetary speech that 'the defence budget has been raised by 15 per cent' over last year' levels, with a special focus on the procurement of military equipment.
In his speech, he has not said what percentage increase this will bring in the total allocation under the ""national defence"" heading to which the bulk of the increase is to be allocated. The 1996-97 allocation is Rs. 32,000 crore. For 2000-01, it is said to have been increased to Rs 38,600 crore or 16.2 per (See Table 1).

A good friend of mine, a senior officer in the British army, once told me that (in his view) Indian defence planners were too often engaged in a form of “strategic masturbation”. I was amused by this comment at the time – and perhaps even agreed with the sentiment - but now I find myself coming closer to agreeing with it.
It is now nearly 20 years since the Kargil conflict and the Indian army is still without a formal strategy for countering cross border threats. It is also 10 years after the end of the IPKF and nearly a decade after India withdrew the bulk of its forces from Sri Lanka and it seems that the strategic vision of Indian military planning is as confused as it was at that time.

The Defence Procurement Manual 2013 : A Guide for Procurers is a compendium of the policies and guidelines relating to defence procurements by the Ministry of Defence. Defence acquisition is responsible for procurement of various items required for military operations. This is done by procuring these items from the Indian private sector and foreign suppliers. Procurement of items through this process is also done through the Defence Public sector undertakings. In the recent years, India’s defence forces have been facing severe shortages of a variety of weapon systems and platforms. These shortages are not only because of inadequate production in the private and public sector industries, but also because there are a lot of procedural bottlenecks.

Abstract
India is one of the fastest growing economy globally and has made significant progress towards economic liberalization since 1990. It has also seen an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in its defense sector. However, the defense industry has been considered to be a strategic sector, and therefore, a significant barrier has remained in the way of foreign investments. This has not only hindered growth of Indian defense manufacturing sector but has created a gap in technology and capabilities in comparison with the developed countries. The present paper attempts to review the present status of FDI in defense in India and its trends, requirements and the forecast. A critical review of available literature, reports and data has enabled the authors to identify the factors responsible for the low F DI inflows into defense and to understand that there is a strong case for allowing F I DI in certain categories in Indian defence industry.",348,199,0.5483870967741935,7.479002866089018,0.8850357857086775,0.05065589715371274,0.857142857142857,0.8706172839506175,0.7859990988497827,66.62607598693975,62.36021505376344,50.31891971664699

This thesis is a study of the defence ties between India and Japan, and how these have evolved and are likely to develop. It is premised on the notion that a nation’s foreign policy is determined by its domestic political culture and interests. India’ s foreign policies, in a sense, are a response to its internal political situation and the nature of its external environment. This study has taken a long-term view of India-Japan relations and examined the genesis and evolution of these relations. An attempt has been made here to analyse and evaluate the bilateral security relationship, including its political underpinnings and its trajectory in the future.
The study focuses on how the security ties of two non-traditional powers, that are not in close proximity to each other, have developed over the past five to six decades and their evolution since the end of World War II. The study attempts to explore the factors which have contributed to the evolution and expansion of bilateral relations, the obstacles and challenges, if",349,199,0.5141509433962265,7.486150735203552,0.8758092638984701,0.05338469744946834,0.86,0.8763829787234034,0.7718363070405148,57.01347904429832,58.37735849056604,61.49352286558859

The Indian Navy is the third largest navy in the world. Vietnam is a fast rising maritime nation with its navy and coast guards growing by leaps and bounds.
With a population of 92 million and its economy growing at 8% a year, Vietnam’s maritime and defence forces are getting stronger as the nation continues to develop its capabilities. The Vietnamese naval force consists of a 12,000-strong navy, a coast guard with about 3,500 personnel, and the 1,200-member marine police.

By Dr S K Bhatnagar
The Indian government'S Defence Policy, which had been in limbo since the 1990s was finally articulated by the then Defence Minister, George Fernandes, and was accepted with alacrity by his successor, Jaswant Singh. This document was presented to parliament in July 2002 and is known as ""Strategic Defence and Allied Review"" or SDAR. The document states that India' S security interests are'regional'. It says in the document, “India is not in a position to undertake a global role, but it is able to play an increasing role and responsibility in maintaining security in our own region and that of our neighbours.”
It says the government ‘will continue to pursue a balanced approach to security concerns. It will continue its traditional approach of pursuing friendly and peaceful relations with neighbours, both bilaterally and in regional organisations."" It also says that the country will",353,196,0.572972972972973,7.793274994194362,0.893318243118437,0.047054996119199666,0.8914285714285713,0.8633540372670807,0.8170053857224109,68.85993212885957,68.6,53.43511759935117

The Indian defence forces are being increasingly burdened by an ever growing number of weapons and military hardware. The government has a responsibility to make sure that the defence expenditure does not get beyond the country’s capacity.
It appears that India’ s self–inflictive defence expenditures are growing by leaps and bounds. In 2005–06, for example, the total defence budget of India is estimated to amount to about Rs 300,000 crores, or more than 1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). This is a 50 per
cent increase as compared to 10 years ago, and more importantly, 25 per-
 cent higher than the global average. It is not only high by any global measure, but
also a significant increase in a country which is yet to become a world power, with a
population of 120 cro- re. As India continues its march towards world",354,191,0.615819209039548,8.192941705230835,0.9063392916758577,0.04166451164062367,0.9199999999999999,0.9142483660130717,0.8380060542484601,82.06831395348837,90.10169491525424,86.53423658155289

The India-Bangladesh relationship has come a full circle. In 2006, the India’s ‘Look East’ policy had led to the signing of the Agreement for the Promotion of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (APNU) between the two countries. This was followed by the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Dhaka, in February 2010. The Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh have met four times since then, and the latest was held during the Indian Prime Minster’ s visit to Bangladesh on 15-16 October. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi have now set the tone and direction for India Bangladesh bilateral relations which is marked by a growing convergence of views in the field of foreign policy and security issues.
A few days before the PM’S visit, Bangladesh Foreign Secretary M.

The relationship between the two nations is not only bilateral but also multi-faceted. In order to promote and strengthen the comprehensive, long term, and all-round strategic co -operation between India and Vietnam, the Vietnamese foreign ministry has decided to send an official delegation to New Delhi to exchange views on bilateral ties, including the situation in the East Sea as well as international and regional issues of mutual concern.

the first paper is an overview of india’s position in defence industry and defence trade with a particular focus of ‘strategic’ offsets. this is followed by papers that focus specifically on various issues such as '",373,180,0.5508982035928144,7.119173739314059,0.8835080195053651,0.052409734667818585,0.8466666666666667,0.8483916083916085,0.7737016543269216,52.84099658924303,53.26347305389221,42.184049930651874

The concept of environmental degradation, as well as of its management and sustainability, has been a subject of intense discussion in India in the context of the development of infrastructure and the growth of economic activity since the liberalization reforms were instituted in 1991. In 2006, the National Action Plan on Environment was adopted to address the environmental issues of concern, particularly the impact of rapid infrastructure development and growth on the environment. The Plan is based on a holistic approach that considers the need for sustainable growth and environmental protection in equal measure.",374,187,0.5929203539823009,6.3028298181701015,0.8894325535864861,0.053854467550648544,0.84,0.8107865168539337,0.7437407420983411,47.60995980005565,44.91150442477876,34.38454011741683

the chinese military buildup on the himaliyas is a very worrying trend. it has taken them 20 years to get to this point, but now we have to face the fact that the chinese are going to try and take the whole of the south tibet plateau by hook or by crook. this is not a good development. and the question is, 'what are we going do about it'?
well, we can do what we've been doing for 40 years now and that is to sit back and watch. but the time has come for the united states and its allies to take action to counter this growing threat. i have long said that it was time to move away from a policy of containment and to go to an active policy that would seek to neutralise china's growing influence and power. we should now make a start with a military build-up in the area that will make china think twice. the us military",375,194,0.5396825396825397,7.419408268023741,0.882334229407988,0.051688005648197276,0.8571428571428571,0.8545454545454554,0.7829694219647643,53.7017637233067,58.370370370370374,52.75063920454545

The Defence Ministry is also working on a 100 per cent indigenisation plan under which all the arms and ammunition that are currently imported will be manufactured in the country by 2030. India’s defence production has witnessed a major shift, with the government’ s aim of 70% localisation in production of defence equipment, including military hardware and weaponry, by the year 2020 on the anvil. It is now aiming to manufacture 85% of the defence components in India. “We have a lot of capacity and capability. The government has been encouraging private and public companies to invest in defence manufacturing, but the private sector has remained hesitant to enter this field.

India'S Defence Spending Is Too High, Say Experts
By Pratik Kanjilal
NEW DELHI: The recent $6.3 billion deal to buy 126 combat jets from France is just the tip of the iceberg. India is likely to spend more than 10 times the amount to modernise its military in the next decade, a report prepared for the government by the Centre for Air Power Studies (Caps), a defence think-tank, shows.
The government has already cleared 20 defence deals worth 3.6 trillion rupees ($61.8 billion). “This is a good beginning but it will have to pick up pace and become more strategic, especially with China’s rise and Pakistan’S nuclear programme,” says the author of Caps’ report. The report, based on an assessment of India’ S defence requirements, says India will require 1,200 fighter aircraft, 900 attack helicopters and 700 subm",382,198,0.6704545454545454,8.894584665044027,0.9226766061057042,0.03443462822659767,0.9028571428571429,0.8973684210526316,0.860607121111529,103.7474931018238,120.7784090909091,104.66363102232668

The United States is in the process of rebalancing its security policy towards Asia, a rebbalance that is being driven primarily by the growing economic, military and demographic power of China.
In this context, India – the United State’s third largest arms supplier after Russia and Israel - has emerged as a key strategic partner to the US in Asia. This has been evident in recent years as the bilateral defence ties between the two countries have grown. The two governments have concluded two landmark defence cooperation agreements since the end of the Cold War, and have been actively engaged in joint training and exercises. India is now the largest importer of US arms. Moreover, as part of a larger trend across the Asia Pacific, US and Indian military forces are increasingly engaged bilaterally through the 'two-plus-two' ministerial dialogue and other military-to-military initiatives. However, the full potential of these ties has not yet been realised.

by ravi shankar (ravi_shank@rediffmail.com)
Indian defence has witnessed a series of transformation during the last decade. The transformation from 'defence' to ‘defense’ was initiated by the then Defence Minister George Fernandes with a view to bring the armed forces under one umbrella. With the transformation, the defence research and design organisations – DRDO and ADE, were also merged as DRDE. A number of indigenous weapon systems were developed during this time.
In the post 9-11 era, defence became a ""frontier area's for Indian economy and the Indian armed services were called upon to play a role of national and international dimension. This resulted in significant increase in defence production. As a result of the new policy of export oriented production, India started making inroads into international market. For instance, in the field of armaments, indigenous products started being exported to countries like South Africa",385,199,0.5944444444444444,7.97530911974925,0.8998397191882809,0.04441160905614423,0.8457142857142858,0.8728205128205128,0.8157383190919596,65.48580462420131,65.37222222222222,62.51304567388621

In the wake of the recent spate of incidents of violence against women in Delhi, the Government of India has initiated a series of measures to improve its policing system. In addition, in the last year, India’s Defence Minister has announced that a new army chief, a navy chief and a chief of air force will take over from their predecessors. The current chief army staff, Gen. V.K. Singh, is set to be superseded by the current vice chief General Dalbir Singh in August. It is to the credit of this army officer that the Army’ first and most visible initiative in its battle against sexual violence has been the formation of special task forces to combat the menace.

this is the status quo ante [the situation before the nuclear tests] and the most probable option. the only thing that may change is that, india is now also a nuclear-state. this is most likely, given that the two states are not going back to their respective pre-testing situation in terms of arms. there are other options, but these are the least likely ones. it is important to note that india and china have never had any nuclear war. their nuclear doctrines were ‘nuclear restraint’ till 2006. india’s current posture is ’limited deterrence‘. both states have",387,183,0.5274725274725275,7.115993439946571,0.87708346009673,0.05438613158713274,0.8228571428571428,0.8362025316455692,0.7703041409012783,43.86095100864553,45.362637362637365,43.54207778522847

The Indian Army’s Air Defence System (ADS) has been developed to provide a protective shield to critical assets. The ADS is a network of sensors and weapons designed to detect and track enemy aircrafts and missiles. However, the Indian Airmen have faced the challenge of integrating the AADS with other Air Force assets such as fighter aircraft and surface to air missiles, thereby making it a complex task to manage and operate.
India’ has witnessed a rapid growth and development of air assets and airbases. In recent years, India has inducted new aircraft such a fighter jets and multirole aircraft as well as helicopters. As the size of the fleet grows, there is also the need for the air bases to be expanded and modernised.

In the previous two parts of this series we had examined the nature of a Police powers claim [see Part 4] and the various grounds for invoking this doctrine – the 5/9 grounds - which has a bearing on whether the action is'reasonable' and proportional to the threat.

They show how India is using diplomacy to develop new relationships, build confidence and expand strategic cooperation with other countries in a range of areas including counterterrorism, nuclear safety, peacekeeping, and disaster response as well as arms sales. These articles also highlight India' s role in peace and security in South Asia and Southeast Asia.

The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has emerged as one of the most important theatres of power competition in the 21st century. India’s maritime engagement with the region is not limited to commercial or civil purposes, however, but also entails defence and security considerations. The Indian government, in its Look East Policy, has recognised the importance of India-Israel relations within its regional maritime strategy, which aims to strengthen maritime security in IOR. In recent years, India has sought to build upon its traditional ties with Israel in order to bolster its security and diplomatic engagement in East Asia.
India and Israel have developed their ties over decades; they are now both considered as the world’ s only liberal democracies. Their shared values have been at the foundation of their cooperation, with shared interests and perspectives on regional security challenges driving bilateral ties further. This partnership has been further consolidated as India seeks to diversify its diplomatic footprint",408,190,0.5876288659793815,8.184723008242214,0.8990747862574633,0.04411449314955049,0.9142857142857144,0.9058823529411762,0.8341841840628,83.39479536498771,87.4381443298969,67.76472701149424

Abstract
This work is an attempt to analyze and suggest ways through which the Indian Armed Forces could achieve carbon neutral status in the coming years. The Armed forces are a major consumer of energy and also a large polluter. In order for the armed forces to achieve a carbon-neutral status, there are many challenges that need to be overcome. These include a lack of political will, a poor knowledge base of the Armed force personnel about climate-change and energy-security risks, low levels of awareness and understanding of climate change and related issues among the general population, high levels and costs of fuel consumption, and a limited capacity to innovate and deploy new technology. This thesis provides a review of existing literature on energy efficiency in armed Forces of countries around the world. An attempt is also made to understand the factors that drive energy use in these forces.",409,194,0.583756345177665,8.19341074860961,0.8981164407030512,0.044404035298174604,0.8685714285714284,0.8744508670520227,0.8198601680201134,77.1500740408556,73.04568527918782,53.66920775149615

Description/Abstract
This paper examines the relationship between the British occupation of Persia from 1838 and Indian frontier policy from the Treaty of Amiens - the end of the war with France and the beginning of 'the great game'. It argues that there is a strong continuity in British policy in Persía and India during the 19th century that is based on the desire to safeguard Indian security. The paper concludes by discussing the relevance of this continuity to British imperial policy and security in the post-Cold War world.

Indian defense,"scraping the bottom of the barrel: budgets, organisation and leadership in the indian defence system","scraping the bottom of the barrel: budgets, organisation and leadership in the indian defence system
The Indian government has a long way to go before it can achieve what the Defence Procurement Procedure of 2008 (DPP) envisages. This is not an indictment of what we have today, but of where we need to be. The problem today is that the Indian defence budget – the biggest budget after the Central government - is still less than 10% of defence capital expenditure. Even if the 2% annual defence spending growth of recent years is sustained, it will take decades to catch up.
What is also clear is how difficult it is for the government to get this spending right. In fact, the DPP is the third Defence Acquisition procedure, each one more onerous than the previous. Yet, despite these efforts, India’s military capability has been falling. A lot of this is due to the fact that, in addition to being a large bureaucracy, defence procurement in India is an unwield",413,189,0.5544041450777202,7.702028533011032,0.8879163824451305,0.04903995061210181,0.8514285714285714,0.8615384615384614,0.7773221621474901,61.634787472035796,59.93782383419689,62.37664640324215

the visit of general rawat is not a visit in the normal sense as it has been done by the defence minister in previous years. it was a political visit. this is because the visit was preceded by a high octane political controversy in india over the purchase of the s400 missile defence equipment from russia. the controversy led to the resignation of a senior minister. in this context, the us president’ presidential address at the 73rd session of un general assembly and his speech before the joint session to congress were significant in many ways. these were not about defence and national security. yet, it can be said that they gave a hint of what is expected to come from him. he made it clear that he wants to make america stronger. america’ first priority is america",415,191,0.5661375661375662,7.783104751750395,0.891464014008455,0.04767749047779989,0.8571428571428571,0.8533333333333327,0.8029938119613609,55.86684782608695,58.04761904761905,51.766616482658634

In a previous blog post, I spoke about the bong middle classes and their consumption of cultural goods. I argued that the Bengalis are the quintessential cultural middle-class – their consumer habits reveal an affinity for a particular brand of culture, the ’bong-middleness’. This middle culture that they subscribe to, is a kind, gentle and accommodating one, which allows for multiple cultural influences to enter their life-space, but at the same time, it does not threaten their cultural identity.
The bongs have been described as “the only people in the world who have a class without a culture”, which implies that for the vast majority of the Indian diaspora, class is defined in terms of material resources that are available to them, rather than their culture. The bings have the luxury of being able to define and negotiate their own culture as their socio-economic position allows it, without feeling the pressure of any other",416,190,0.5376884422110553,7.585028893589194,0.8827809826170588,0.0509902170720762,0.8628571428571429,0.8770285714285714,0.7907884701358605,67.72582697201017,66.83417085427136,59.5653311965812

India’s military modernisation and expansion are a cause for concern in the region
In the coming years, India will be the fastest-growing large economy in South Asia. In the long term, a rising India could help stabilise and strengthen the South Asian region.
At the same time, however, this is also a period of intense uncertainty for India’ss security. The rise of China, and the potential for conflict on the Indian subcontinent, could lead to the militarisation of regional politics. This would have significant implications for the security of other countries - including Japan, the United States and Australia. To avoid a destabilising spiral, it is vital for all parties to understand how the current security and defence policies in India may affect the wider region and how they might affect their own regional strategies.

India and the US have signed a new military pact, the first since Washington'S previous defence ties with New Delhi were cut short in 2002, when the country was accused of conducting nuclear tests, and it will take into account the interests of both countries, said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao.

In a previous post I pointed out that the US has decided to increase its defense and security cooperation with Pakistan. In the past the United States has accused China of having a negative role in the Indo-Pak conflict. This time, however, the Chinese government has not reacted, as they are more interested in developing trade relations with both nations.
The US decision to expand the cooperation between the two nations could have a profound effect on the Indian government, who have always maintained that Pakistan is the biggest threat against peace and harmony in South Asia. It has already been reported that Indian officials were “furious at the decision”. The New York Times reports that “[w]hile the Obama administration has been seeking to repair a relationship that had deteriorated under President George W. Bush, some American officials privately expressed fears that closer security ties could undermine India-U.S. ties.”

Abstract
This thesis examines the evolution and current status of defence indegenization in India, a program that seeks to increase local production of defense equipment. India'a indenigenizing efforts began in the mid-1950s with the formation of the Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) and the Indian Ordance Department. However, these entities were primarily intended as research and development organizations rather than as manufacturing entities. It was only following a 1974 Cabinet resolution that OFB began manufacturing. Over the decades, the program has been a significant contributor to the development of a domestic defense industry in addition to providing critical capabilities to India. The thesis will examine the current state of indegneous production and how the indgenous program",421,195,0.632183908045977,8.339078479367938,0.9111126152317206,0.03967214058624792,0.86,0.8546666666666668,0.8255241916123949,93.95453963375593,79.48850574712644,61.83963750985028

The Government of India has a very strong focus on ‘Make in India’ which means that the Ministry of Defence is trying to increase the manufacturing content of defence equipment.
India has started the first phase of Make in Defence programme, which is focused on creating the infrastructure in the form of a Defence Manufacturing Zones and Defence Industrial Corridors. The Defence Ministry is looking closely on a few countries which are also working aggressively on defence manufacturing. These countries includes Israel, France, Germany & Japan.

This is an abridged version of a report prepared for the India Foundation by Dr. Ajai Sahni and Dr S. Chandrasekharam (both retired from the defence forces and senior fellows at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi) on the need to build an industrial base for defence and security in India. [1]. The defence budget, which is already in short supply, needs to be increased. A 20-year plan for indigenization of defence manufacturing needs immediate attention. The government must also initiate steps to develop strategic industries for military needs – an “industrial complex”, if you will.
In other words, in order to ensure that India does not become the next victim of an arms embargo, or the victim, by the way its military operations go, of the arms trade, it has to start planning now, and in a big way, for its own defence industry and its supply of military hardware. And this means building an industry",437,199,0.5477386934673367,7.726805134590861,0.8862795621208761,0.049468336644084177,0.8857142857142858,0.8802285714285716,0.8033152027435667,72.20036658256122,64.77386934673366,65.49094593883245

defencetalk.com
The challenges of the Indian defence market -- from the lack of indigenous manufacturing capacity to a complex procurement bureaucracy – have been well-documented. However, in addition to the obstacles, India’s defence procurement market also presents a number of opportunities.
One of them is the potential for greater participation of domestic industry. While this is a key goal of India's Make II programme, which aims to increase the local content in defence equipment and services, there are many challenges facing the domestic defence manufacturing industry that must be addressed. The Indian military’ s requirement for high-technology and sophisticated military equipment has created opportunities for the country’S defence industry in the fields of design & development, production, integration and testing. In particular, the industry will be able to leverage its capabilities in manufacturing, systems integration, software development/programming, and maintenance and repair to provide solutions to meet the needs of both the armed forces",440,199,0.5647668393782384,7.84599168316077,0.8914353142276398,0.047500312219032136,0.8971428571428571,0.8826035502958585,0.7929701781631396,59.926940639269404,64.70984455958549,65.13946472019464

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) of India announced a new policy in August 2016 to increase the participation of the defence industry in defence procurements and boost local defence production. The government also plans to establish a Defence Industrial Corridors to boost defence manufacturing. As part of this, the MoD has issued a policy notification for the procurement of power by Defence Forces. This is to provide an impetus to the development of local manufacturing capabilities for meeting the future defence requirements. Defence Ministry has approved a 20 per cent cap on foreign direct investment … The policy will ensure that the government gives more impetus on the indigenous defence industries in India. 1. It is a major component of National Power Policy 2005.The electricity sector is divided into three segments- generation, transmission and distribution.

Thesis
This dissertation examines a key period in the history of Indian administration (1920-24) and British imperialism - a time when the Raj was at its weakest. It is concerned with the changing nature of British intelligence activities within the Indian empire. At the end of World War 1, Britain was in possession of one of its largest overseas territories. In the period between 1918 and 1922, the British government had to grapple not only with a vast number of domestic issues such as a labour movement, an economic recession and a constitutional crisis, but also the challenge to its authority of a growing nationalist movement. The result was a series of events, which have come to be known as the 'Rajput Scandal'. The Rajput scandal was the first serious crisis of imperial authority in British India. This dissertation will investigate the role played by the intelligence services in dealing with this crisis and",462,188,0.5445026178010471,7.525175895041185,0.8842629696962797,0.050738858959949125,0.84,0.8622754491017965,0.7833445813716761,56.574873249637854,49.86910994764398,54.97825670498084

by:
- The total expenditure incurred by the defence services in a year (the budgeted expenditure) and the total capital expenditure on the acquisition of new hardware & equipment by these services
(capital outlay for procurement of capital equipment).
It is, thus clear that even if one were to take the maximum capital outlays incurred in the last three years as capitalisation of defence outgo, it still does not add upto half of the budgetary expenditure. In other words, the ratio of expenditure to budget has increased significantly over the years.
The defence budget is a highly politicized subject. There is an almost constant demand for more spending in order to “catch up” with our neighbours, particularly in view of China’s aggressive posturing and its growing naval and strategic presence in our neighbourhood. While the demand does have its merits, we cannot lose sight of some of its consequences. The biggest of these is",463,190,0.5526315789473685,7.617500626155123,0.8869714120143601,0.04960105732290608,0.8685714285714285,0.8633734939759033,0.8044158654602555,59.23143350604491,65.72105263157894,61.18892770015525
Indian defense,additive manufacturing in aerospace and defence sector: strategy of india,"additive manufacturing in aerospace and defence sector: strategy of india to enhance indigenization
The manufacturing sector in India has grown significantly over the years. India is among the most attractive markets for foreign companies in this sector.
In terms of market value, the Indian aerospace manufacturing market is estimated at $7.7 billion in 2018. This market includes manufacturing of aircraft components as well as MRO (maintenance repair and overhaul).
Aerospace and Defence are two important sectors for India to achieve its ‘Make inIndia’ vision and its plans for Atma Nirbhar Bharat 2.0. The sector has been identified as one of the key sectors by the Government of India (“GoI”) and will be accorded topmost priority. There are a lot of initiatives under various schemes of GoI such as “Make-In-India” to boost the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Some of these initiatives include:

Abstract
There is a need to develop a comprehensive technology transfer policy that would ensure effective transfer to the end users. This requires a clear vision of how the policy is to be implemented with appropriate institutional mechanism. The objective of this paper is twofold: to analyse the current status of the technology flow in the context of transfer of military technology from developed nations to developing nations; and to examine the possible avenues of technology development for India to become a technology provider country. To achieve this, the paper will first briefly examine why technology transfers are not happening, and then look at various options for technology acquisition. Finally, it will examine what the future holds for the Indian military in terms of future defence needs and technology.",467,190,0.5231788079470199,6.42892882429216,0.8708798381955191,0.05925724086474629,0.84,0.8274015748031488,0.7457662321554506,44.19696666132393,42.01324503311258,38.750517598343684

Introduction
The Defence Research and Development Organisation is a premier science and technology institution that has been at the forefront of indigenous technology development and indigenous defence manufacturing since inception in 1958. The DRDO, as it is commonly known, is one of the three wings of India’s Ministry of Defence that is tasked with the development, acquisition, research and development of all weapon systems and platforms for the Indian Armed Forces. Its other wings include the Defence Acquisition and Research, and the Military Engineering Services.
History
DRDO was formally established as a government-owned corporation in April 1979, with a charter to carry out research in defence and aerospace sectors. It was then renamed as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Defence Organisation & was placed",471,181,0.5872093023255814,7.701177801796536,0.8965760988437703,0.046263737461850724,0.8533333333333334,0.8621621621621619,0.8065863242549917,76.48672566371681,72.57558139534883,54.840062111801245

The 2016 defence spending of India is estimated at 0.83 per cent of its GDP. This is lower than the average defence expenditure during 2008-12 (~1.3 per
cent), but higher than in many developing countries.
India’s expenditure on defence has increased substantially over the past decade, especially in the period after 9/11. But this increase in
defence expenditure is largely due to the rise in expenditure incurred on personnel rather than on capital and equipment. The share of capital
expenditure in defence increased only slightly. As a result, the defence-to-GDP ratio remained at around 2 per-cent for ten fiscal years, and is
still less than half of what China spends. In fact, China’ s defence /GNP ratio is almost ",472,196,0.553072625698324,7.399607418244165,0.885825736146461,0.05067985451491177,0.9085714285714285,0.9024516129032252,0.7991920224122468,65.69627364084639,66.29608938547486,55.60054875474884

A ship in distress at sea is a scene of horror. The life and death of a ship at the mercy of the waves are the most thrilling and dramatic episodes of naval history. This book tells the story of Indian Shipyard. Indian Navy had a dream of building her own aircraft carriers, submarines and other warships. In spite of this, the first warship made in India in the post-independence years was an American second hand vessel, namely the aircraft carrier Rajput, which India purchased from the US. It was not until 1964 that India decided to build an aircraft carrying carrier on her shores and she decided on the design to be used for this project, and the shipyards in which it be built and operated. Thus came into being the ‘INS Vikrant’, India’s first aircraft aircraft",474,186,0.5706521739130435,7.740702698132099,0.8924290857019751,0.047496497601331324,0.8514285714285714,0.85125,0.7993132851283381,59.97222465113647,58.84782608695652,49.86666666666667

Abstract
This paper examines the strategic partnership between Thailand and India from the perspective of defence convergence. The objective of the study is to assess to what extent the two countries have achieved convergence in the area of military cooperation. To assess the status of convergence, the paper draws upon the theory of strategic cooperation to analyse their defence relations. It argues that the convergence process has advanced at a rapid rate and that a new form of cooperation has emerged, one that is based upon a convergence of national defence priorities and interests.

It also marks a new era in Indian-Singapore defence ties.

The Defence Planning Committee (the committee set up by the Prime Minister's Office for strategic planning of India' defense) recently held its first meeting for 3-4 February 08 in New Delhi. As a first step of the meeting, the committee decided to conduct a comprehensive review of all aspects of defence and security of ""the country and … to evolve a long-term vision to ensure that our defence forces meet the challenges of an increasingly sophisticated security situation"".
In view of this review, a number of important developments have been made in the security scenario and the Indian security establishment is taking a hard look at the changing security matrix in a global context. In the recent past, India had taken a few key initiatives in order to build a strong defence capability. The decision to acquire 126 MIG aircraft from Russia is in many ways an extension of these initiatives.

The study group was classified into two groups i.e. Vegetarians, subjects who consume atleast 75% of diet from plant origin. Non vegetarian,subjects who consumed <75 % from diet containing animal origin were included in the study. 5 ml of fasting blood was collected from study subjects and was analysed for various biochemical parameters in a reputed diagnostic laboratory. Total antioxidant capacity(TAC) was measured by using FRAP method.

I will start by talking about disability in general as a disability is a condition which impairs one’s ability to perform the functions of life. “Disability” has been defined by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: Disability is an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations, restrictions of participation and other aberrations that result in barriers that prevent the achievement of the fullest potential of individuals. In fact, a study of more than 2,700 adults with disabilities showed that people who have experienced a significant disability before age 22 have a lower likelihood of employment as young adults compared to those who experienced their disability at a later age.

The main factors of the current slowdown were the following:
- The growth rates of capital formation and private and public consumption were significantly weaker than previously expected;
india’s economy
This is due to a slowdown in private investment, in particular in the infrastructure sector; in turn, a decline in investment led to the growth of industrial production and the production of intermediate goods. The decline also affected the demand for energy and intermediate raw materials, which led (at the same time) to lower exports, lower investment and consumption of households. At the macroeconomic level, the slowdown was exacerbated by the negative impact of global developments. For example, exports were negatively affected, and investment by foreign. This was due in part to an increase in protectionism, especially in – in this case the countries of",4,185,0.5054347826086957,6.856050961202716,0.8691573019935769,0.05777184225464838,0.8171428571428571,0.8150000000000002,0.7565196031382672,43.020725388601036,42.35326086956522,41.38214285714286

Indian economy,the sustainability of trade deficits in the presence of endogenous structural breaks: evidence from the indian economy,"the sustainability of trade deficits in the presence of endogenous structural breaks: evidence from the indian economy, 1979-2007
AbstractWe examine how sustainable are the trade balance deficits of the Indian economy using the standard unit root test and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. We find evidence of structural break in India's real trade balances in both the short-term and long-terms. A break appears to be associated with the introduction of economic reforms in 1991 and also with a rise in oil prices during the mid-1990s. These results imply that the sustainability hypothesis that has been used to argue for liberalization in other developing countries is not applicable to India. The results also suggest that trade liberalizations, such as the WTO negotiations, may have been delayed because of concerns about the long run sustainability (2008)

Abstract
This study investigates the energy dynamics in India between 1980 and 2006. A co 2 emissions equation is constructed based on the neoclassical growth model and energy balance theory. The model is tested for the entire period for robustness and the results are then used as inputs to a computable general equilibrium (cge) model. We find a close correspondence between the model outputs and those of the cge model as regards energy demand, energy intensity and co and n

In the first stage of analysis, we compare the different economic paths that have been followed.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of India' s economic reforms on its middle and upper middle classes (UMCs). It argues that the political significance of both groups is underestimated in the literature and that their interests are likely to play an important role in shaping India's political future. The paper first discusses the origins and characteristics of the UMCs as a social group in India. It then examines recent trends in household income distribution and consumption in order to assess whether the middle- and -upper middle – classes have grown in importance in recent decades, and how they are distributed across the country. Next, it examines how the growth of these groups affected the nature of political competition and conflict, in particular the rise of caste-based and class- oriented politics. This is followed by an analysis of how economic policy has shifted from one based on ""command and control"" to one emphasizing competition, markets and liberalizing policies.

Indian economy,national and regional growth performance in the indian economy: a sectoral analysis,"national and regional growth performance in the indian economy: a sectoral analysis
Abstract (Summary)This paper analyses the growth experience of different industrial sectors and regions of India since 1970 using an input-output model. We also examine the contribution of each sector to the total output growth during the recent period. The model provides an explanation for the uneven distribution of income within the country and among different regions. While the share of agriculture in total employment has been declining, in terms of output contribution it has remained constant. In addition, while agricultural productivity has risen, output share in agriculture has declined. It is also observed from the model that the manufacturing sub-sector has contributed the maximum to both growth and employment in India. Among regions, Maharashtra has emerged as the most productive state in both absolute and relative terms in all the years since the early 1960s, with Tamil Nadu second.

Shocks to economic Growth - A case Study of India

V.Vipin Kumar
Abstract
This research paper analyzes the economic effect of the shocks to the Indian economy on its growth during the period 1956- 2008. In order to achieve this objective, various data series such as GDP data, inflation data etc. were used. It has been observed from the time series of GDP that the economy has faced a negative shock to growth due to various reasons. However the effect due the negative shocks has not been significant. The analysis also showed that a rise in inflation has led to a reduction in economic activity in India. Thus in order not to face the impact of negative growth shocks and to increase the rate of growth in the near future, the government has to reduce the level of inflation in a sustainable manner. Further it has also been noticed that India has experienced negative external shocks.

This thesis presents an in-depth analysis and case-based study of two successful projects in the areas of education and health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia. The first case involves the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development (Harvard Project) and its efforts to improve social and economic life for American Indians in Indian Country. This study explores the impact of these efforts on the American Indigenous community and provides insights into how the lessons of Harvard can be transferred to Australia' s First Nations peoples.
The second case is a successful project in Western Australia that provides an alternative model of Aboriginal health care. It also explores why the Aboriginal Medical Service model is an effective approach to health services provision for remote Aboriginal people, and what lessons could be learnt for First Nation health. By exploring the successes and failures of both the Indian and the Australian Aboriginal initiatives, insights are drawn into effective ways of",16,189,0.5346534653465347,7.598853483087153,0.8820450463371458,0.05116571609262674,0.9199999999999999,0.9044943820224708,0.8150495630903597,71.06698933782268,75.46039603960396,71.93661971830986

Economic reform since liberalisation has been slow in India. The country has made some significant progress, yet the country’s economy is still in a mess. This article discusses the economic reforms since the liberalisations.
The liberalizations in 1987 and 2013 brought many changes to the economy of India and it has had an effect on the Indian economy in the past 3 decades. In 1972 the Congress government introduced a five-year development plan and this led to increased industrialization and urbanization of the nation. However, this plan was not enough to solve the problems facing the society and economy. So the second liberalization, which took place in January 2021 was necessary. There have been several changes in economic activities since then, including privatization. But there are still many problems in terms of economic growth.

1.0 Introduction
The Indian economy is one of the fastest growing in Asia, which has been growing at an average rate of 6% per annum over the last two decades and has grown at 4% over last decade.
2.1 Background
In the early nineties, the Indian macroeconomic environment was characterized by a low growth rate, high inflation, and a large fiscal deficit. In an attempt to revive the economy and improve macro-economic management, a number of structural reforms have been initiated and the macro management of economy has undergone significant changes since 1991 with the initiation of economic reforms. The reforms are based on a liberalized trade regime and opening to foreign investment, reduction of government intervention, improved governance and transparency in economic management. It has improved macro stability and reduced volatility in growth. Since the reforms of early 90’s, Indian growth performance has also improved and",24,194,0.4946808510638298,6.782722104652097,0.8655876500354998,0.0591042306091549,0.8228571428571428,0.8465853658536584,0.7631900384986295,44.640562248995984,45.76063829787234,47.34095238095238

Agriculture is the largest sector, employing nearly three-fourths of the Indian population. It accounts for nearly 14 percent of India' s gross domestic product (GDP). About 56 percent.
The Indian economy is predominantly agrarian, with agriculture accounting for 19.6 percent percent - in a year when the economy has grown only 2.2 percent..
India has a long and rich tradition of agricultural research and development and has made important scientific advances in recent decades. Its scientists have made major contributions in the areas of plant breeding, soil conservation, irrigation and agricultural meteorology. The country has also developed a variety of high-yielding, drought-resistant crops, such as the improved varieties of groundnut, pigeonpea, cotton and wheat. In the 1980s, India developed an effective and cost-efficient system of integrated nutrient management and fertilizer use, and achieved a major",25,191,0.5714285714285714,7.708992893275452,0.89246443719507,0.047580604478516676,0.8628571428571429,0.8625316455696205,0.7939950344094523,60.666666666666664,60.214285714285715,57.871416725894335

the answer to that question is an absolute no. india’s poor has benefitted more from the economic reforms than any other group in the country.
but it is also a fact that india, as a growing economy has also left behind the poorest among the lot. the rural economy, the agricultural sector and the small-and-micro enterprises have been adversely affected as the economy moved on from a centrally-planned to a market driven one. in other words, india has moved away from an economy that was primarily led by the state to the one that is led primarily by market forces. and this has had its impact on some of the sectors of india. especially the agriculture and rural sector – india is a highly agrarian country with 67% of its work force still living and working in rural areas. so this sector is of paramount importance to india as it has the ability to pull many other sectors up with it. this is why it was so important for",29,196,0.465,6.576093065034891,0.8554790473237238,0.06280707028965674,0.8399999999999999,0.8584090909090905,0.7682211116428226,40.0,45.15,41.44931034482759

A model is used to analyse the effects of diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis, jaundice, malaria, dengue, encephalitis, typhoid, and tuberculosis. In the model the total health expenditure of a country is divided into two components namely the direct costs incurred on the treatment of patients and loss of productivity of healthy people. Direct health expenditures on treatment are estimated based on data from WHO and the World Bank, whereas the loss due of lost productivity is estimated using data on productivity loss from the National Commission on Population.

The financial system in India is a highly regulated industry that is divided into different segments and governed by different regulators. Indian banks, however, are the only ones to be allowed to operate outside the country’s territory. As the Indian stock market is one of the top ten most capitalized stock markets in Asia and the third largest in emerging markets. It is also the second-largest country by area and, after China, the most populous country of South Asia with about 1.3 billion people.

Indian economy,the indian economic success: a challenge to some race relations assumptions,"the indian economic success: a challenge to some race relations assumptions
The Indian economy is on track to become the fourth largest in the world and its economic growth is the fastest of all emerging markets. This paper examines why this is so. We argue that two factors are most important: the rapid increase in India's stock of knowledge - the result of an educational investment programme that was begun in 1973 [1] and the adoption in that same year of a'market friendly' macro-economic policy. These two features have led to rapid growth of the manufacturing sector, and with this growth has come a rise in productivity and a substantial increase is labour skills. The second part of this paper discusses the implications of these developments for a race-relations theory of economic development. Our analysis of Indian data indicates that the increase of India in economic performance and labour productivity has taken place at the expense of labour and income shares of China. While this suggests that India is not on a similar path to East Asia, the data also indicate that,",33,198,0.5396039603960396,7.669213237560181,0.8837813293639865,0.05041256277732219,0.875,0.8844943820224719,0.7899381659418816,73.20270169136359,70.6930693069307,70.42533405561575

The analysis is based on the autoregressive distributed lag – ARDL, co-integrating and error correction model, which provides an empirical analysis of determinants and dynamics of inflow of FDI.

The paper analyzes the evidence on the economic impact of industrial policies in India by using a new methodology that does not rely on standard productivity decompositions. The analysis is based on a newly constructed panel of firm-level data from 1978 to 1990 for manufacturing, and 1981-1992 for services. Using a ""non-parametrized"" approach for estimating the productivity equation, a strong and statistically significant decline in the manufacturing sector is found. This decline is more pronounced and longer lasting in services, but it is not statistically different from the decline found in manufacturing. However, in a second stage of estimation, the effects of economic reform on efficiency are also estimated. In both manufacturing (for 2-digit SIC) and Services ((for the ISIC4-classification of 7-digits), the reforms are found to increase efficiency",38,181,0.5138121546961326,6.912635560098647,0.8719057577396702,0.05673714747802482,0.8628571428571428,0.8690445859872615,0.782431534644908,60.333333333333336,57.78453038674033,54.58693009118541

Abstract
This article explores the impact of public policies on the technological change in Indian agriculture since independence. It argues that India's agriculture has been characterised by a “dual technological structure” - a combination of imported and indigenous technologies. In spite of significant state intervention in agriculture, this dual structure remained intact. The article traces the emergence of this structure and its consequences. A new model of agricultural development, based largely on imported technologies, was introduced from the early 1960s. However, the state continued to play a crucial role in the development of the agricultural extension system, which promoted the adoption of new technologies by small farmers. This model proved incapable of providing a sustainable development path, however, as it was based on an unsustainable pattern of production which relied heavily on external inputs. As a result, by the mid-1990, India had become highly vulnerable to international fluctuations in agricultural prices",39,189,0.5291005291005291,7.273929674533079,0.8785563616018374,0.053347540545389455,0.8742857142857143,0.8790303030303028,0.7901516131753215,57.784768211920536,59.333333333333336,52.26575473706621
Indian economy,what determines indian economic success?: evidence from tribal and individual indian enterprises,"what determines indian economic success?: evidence from tribal and individual indian enterprises
In this paper, we investigate why tribal enterprises are more successful than individual enterprises in the Indian economy, which is characterized by a high degree of informality. We show that tribal enterprise success is driven by two main factors: the tribal identity and the social networks that are formed among tribal members. Our analysis, based on a sample of tribal firms and on the individual-level data of the NSSO Household Survey, suggests that the success of a tribal firm is a function of its membersâ€™ social interactions. In the case of individual firms, the level of success depends on its ability to create social and business links. The analysis suggests a mechanism through which social network effects might explain the observed tribal-individual enterprise gap in India.

Ans:
The Indian economy has been in the process of a gradual transition from a planned to a market economy - a shift from command to competition. This is the most significant and important change that has transformed the economy in a post-independence period. The process is gradual as the Indian state is still the dominant force in determining the direction of the economic policy, and the state remains the major employer in both the public and private sector. As the transition takes place the market and state continue to operate in parallel, but with increasing convergence. It is therefore important to understand the relationship between the two and also to appreciate the differences between them as this will help in understanding their respective roles and functions.. For example, the government continues to intervene in markets for the sake of price stability, to promote",45,200,0.515,7.283199846221439,0.8747548830298282,0.05443002360081416,0.815,0.8311363636363637,0.7660347935360068,47.28654124457309,49.905,42.11521518875821

Abstract
This study aims to examine the changes in structure, composition and performance of India's exports in the context of economic reforms and structural transformation. It seeks to answer the following questions : 1) How have changes affected Indiaâ€™s trade structure? 2) What has been the impact on India of the shift towards export-led growth? Has it been beneficial or detrimental? And 3) Is the export growth pattern different for different sectors and groups of states? The analysis is based on a set of data covering the period from 1979/80 through 2006/7. The data used for analysis covers the pre-reform era, the reform period, and the post reform era. An analysis of export structure is carried out using the product space concept.

In this context it is important to point out that the government has been trying to provide some support by providing a loan at subsidized rate of interest of 3 percent. This is the main reason why the number of SMEs in India has increased over the years. [11] In India, the growth of Small and Micro Enterprises can be linked to the development of a number a small scale industries. As a result, they can also help in reducing the unemployment level as it provides more employment opportunities to many. The government of India is also working on the policy of encouraging SMEs through various programs. It is believed that if the SMEs grow, then India will develop faster and more efficiently. SMEs provide the employment in the unorganized and informal manufacturing sector. Small scale sector is not only providing jobs but it also provides employment to millions of people who can earn their livelihood from this sector and this is very important for a developing nation like India.

This study is the first one to provide a rigorous analysis of the relationship between Indian trade reforms and economic performance. It uses a new data set on India, based on trade data at the sector, state and firm levels, covering all sectors and the entire economy. The results reveal that while Indian manufacturing has grown relatively fast after the reforms, there is no clear evidence that services have benefited, and that the growth rate of Indian exports has been slower after reform. These results are robust to a number of alternative measures of liberalisation.

The rural sector has been a major component of the Indian economy, contributing significantly in its growth and development. It also provides a large share of employment (about 50% of India’s total workforce) and has a great potential to contribute to economic growth.
India’ s rural economy is characterized by a high degree of self-reliance and a strong emphasis on self help. The rural people are very dependent on the land for their livelihood and thus have developed a very high level of knowledge of farming practices, which they are able to pass on to their children. In addition, the rural areas tend to be more stable than urban areas, where economic and political upheavals are common. This stability is due to the high rate of fertility which ensures a continuing supply of workers and the fact that there are less social and economic barriers preventing people from participating in economic activities. As such rural India is seen as a source of labour",53,188,0.5661375661375662,7.783104751750395,0.891464014008455,0.04767749047779989,0.8742857142857143,0.8940606060606049,0.8002114106054069,63.0,61.72486772486773,65.66036843101382

Indian economy,"emergence of an industrial labour force in a dual economy-british india, 1880-1920","emergence of an industrial labour force in a dual economy-british india, 1880-1920
The emergence of a large industrial workforce in British India was the most dramatic and significant feature of the economic development of South Asia at the turn of 20th century. It had an important political, social and economic impact on the region in the period. This paper examines this process of industrialisation by focusing specifically on two dimensions of it, the emergence or growth of wage labour, and the impact of that growth on rural India. The paper traces the growth in wage employment in India’s urban areas as a result of growth and expansion of industry and argues that the labour market for urban wage labourers was a product of economic processes in which the rural areas were only indirectly involved. Thus, while wage workers and urban employment were important indicators of urbanisation, it must be understood that these changes did not occur in isolation from the rest of Indian society.

It will reduce the burden on small and medium-sized businesses and make them more competitive, and it will create jobs by increasing the competitiveness of the economy in the long term. The introduction of this tax will also lead the government to spend more on infrastructure projects and create employment as well as generate more revenue in other sectors like healthcare, banking, etc. GST would make the tax system more transparent and equitable. For example, an exporter who exports to another country will pay tax only at the point of export.

The Indian capital market has been witnessing a series of reforms since last few decades. The reforms in Indian securities law started with the Securities Law Amendment Act,1964. This was further amended in 1968 and 1975. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India Act 1959 was amended and Reserve bank of Indi Act in the year 1994 has provided the RBI with more autonomous role. These reforms have resulted in a greater number of companies coming into the capital markets for raising of resources. During this period, various factors, namely, economic growth and liberalization, had been playing their role in changing the pattern of growth of Indian Capital market. However, it is difficult to isolate the factors that are driving the growth in capital marke.

Abstract
In the context of the global economy, India is a major destination for foreign direct investment, especially in the manufacturing sector. However, the rapid growth of this industry has not benefited the labour force in terms of higher wages, better working conditions and job security. In fact, labour in India, as elsewhere in South Asia, remains relatively undervalued and under-employed. The current industrial and economic policies have been shaped by the dominant global market-oriented ideology. As a result, workers are often seen only in economic and political terms. This paper focuses on one of India`s most vulnerable sectors, namely, textiles and clothing, to demonstrate how the state has been unable to protect the interests of workers and ensure decent employment.",68,181,0.6046511627906976,7.929925657295443,0.9022624346780211,0.04372011702968091,0.86,0.8613513513513504,0.7951179278313077,62.0845383759733,64.9186046511628,57.50051890289103

The first stage of an economic system (in the case of a developing country, as in India today) is that which depends on the external market for its raw material. During this stage, which we call the ‘pre-industrialisation’ stage, the economic activities are confined to production of food, fodder and furs for the market. The raw materials are drawn from the land and from other natural resources like forests, water sources and the like.
This stage is also called as the primary stage because here the main concern of the people was to survive and there was very little attention to the growth and development of economic activity. This is why the level of technological development in this pre- industrial stage was at a very low level. There was a heavy dependence on nature for food and other resources.",69,200,0.5,6.557438524302001,0.8653428024678452,0.06023506331061401,0.8266666666666667,0.8308108108108118,0.7630054580213393,48.77314814814815,51.06395348837209,44.87563613231552

It is not a textbook - it does not have exercises or problems at the end of the chapters. But it is full of insights, analysis, anecdotes.

India is the largest democracy in a globalising world where the role of market forces has been given more importance than ever before.

Macroeconomic Adjustment in developing economies is a function of the structural, political, and institutional environment as well as macroeconomic policy and the external environment. The structural and political environment are not static, but they change over time. As such, the adjustment to a macroecological shock (an external shock) depends on the time period in which the shock occurred.
This study analyzes the effects of macro-economic shocks on macroeco- nomic variables and macro adjustments for the period 1950-1999 in India. This time frame was selected due to the availability of data. Macro variables were analyzed in the form of their deviations.

This study examines the effect of international acquisition of Indian companies by foreign companies on value creation for acquiring firms. The results show that acquisitions create value for foreign firms and are significantly more profitable. This paper also finds that the acquisition method has an impact on the value of the target: (1) cross-border takeovers are more effective than domestic mergers and acquisitions and ; () the use of equity as a payment medium in the transaction does not have any effect on shareholder wealth but is associated with a higher probability of a successful deal and higher profitability; and, finally, that a deal's success is not associated:1999.",85,182,0.574468085106383,6.821430560638804,0.887989971632394,0.052116616546005176,0.8879999999999999,0.8741880341880348,0.808102506969985,65.93393782383419,60.645390070921984,56.31815789473684

The Portuguese began to trade in this area and established a factory at Malacca in the Malay Peninsula. The most important commodity exported was pepper - a red, pungent spice that is produced from dried berries of the piper vine, which grows wild in many parts of Asia. In 1540, he sent a second expedition to establish trade contacts with southern India. A new era of trade with Europe was opened and the Indian Ocean became a focus of European trade and power in Asia and Africa. As a result of this change in policy, the Portuguese were able to expand their influence over a much wider area, and eventually became the dominant sea-faring power of Europe. It also meant an increase in trade opportunities for the Europeans. 1 The Portuguese established trading posts in India to gain access to spices, but it was only after the establishment of a direct maritime contact with the east that trade between Europe",89,190,0.5625,7.794228634059948,0.8905630715407273,0.047929255712532766,0.8914285714285715,0.8911904761904755,0.7960318982425051,73.05493318936428,72.11979166666667,63.13864734299517

The Indian economy is in its nascent stages of economic development. The per capita GDP has increased from Rs. 8,000 in 1951 to Rs 50, 000/- in year 2000. In other words, its growth has been very fast in last 5 decades, but in real terms, it is not so much because of the population growth rate. India has an average growth of 2.8% per annum since 1942 to 1996.
During the last decade of last century, there were a number of macroeconomic problems like:
• Balance of payments problems. Due to the increasing capital flight and the rising trade deficit, the balance of payment problems became serious. As a result, India was forced to seek the assistance of IMF. This has a negative impact on the economic stability of a country. It is also a major cause of capital market volatility.

Abstract:
This study investigates the nexus between government size (measured as public expenditure and public debt-to-GDP) and Economic Growth (% GDP) for India between the period 1970-1971 to 2017-18. We have used panel cointegration technique to find long-term relationship between two variables. This study finds a positive long term relationship, which indicates there is a cointegrating relationship exist between Government Size Index and GDP for the study period. Our results imply that Government expenditure is an important component of the economy and it is positively associated with the economic development of a country in the sense that the expenditure helps the development process. The results of Granger-Causality tests also support the long run and short run causal relationships. In other words, the results suggest that an increase in expenditure by the government is the result of economic and development in a given year and",96,192,0.5351351351351351,7.2786247587286965,0.8802311574356421,0.05282742417078507,0.8571428571428571,0.860372670807454,0.7996800679918736,56.79349140272167,55.86486486486486,58.67222888355982

Abstract
An attempt has been made here to examine the long term impact of carbon emissions on economic growth in developing countries using the cointegration methodology with vector error correction model to test the hypothesis on the short and long run relationships between energy consumption, carbon emission and economic performance. The empirical findings suggest that there exists a long –run relationship between CO2 emission (em) and real GDP / capita, and between the level of CO 2 emissions and energy consumed in India. Moreover, the results suggest the importance of trade in promoting economic development and growth, particularly for a developing economy like India that has a very high level trade to GDP ratio.",97,186,0.5629139072847682,6.917201899554855,0.8854700955469541,0.05256131993287976,0.9133333333333332,0.8944881889763787,0.8068862163131193,75.5,70.15894039735099,69.23417721518987

About 40% of India’s population live in rural areas. The Indian economy is highly rural and agricultural oriented. Most rural households are engaged in nonfarm activities, especially agricultural laborers. There has been an ongoing process of migration of rural workers to towns and cities over several decades, but the share of the rural population in the total population has remained high.
The share in total exports of manufactured and value-added services in 2007-08 was 9%, up from 3.9% in fiscal 1999-00. This has increased with the global demand for Indian products. India has also become the second largest software exporter in terms of value after the United States.

About the project
The project investigates the impact of globalisation on policy formulation in India and the role of the state vis-a-vis the global economy. It explores the ways in which India has sought to manage its growing relationship with the rest of world.
It will examine how Indian policymakers have sought ‘nationalist’ ways of responding to challenges posed by global economic integration. The research aims to analyse the policies and strategies adopted to protect domestic producers, and their impact on the development of India’s industries, agriculture, manufacturing and trade. In addition, it will investigate how India uses its role and voice within the international economic system to promote its interests. This includes, in particular, the question as to the extent to which economic globalism (or 'globalisation') has led to increased regional integration in South Asia or to greater economic fragmentation in global South.",103,191,0.532258064516129,7.259032193556989,0.8793231163020548,0.053173031687435875,0.8685714285714285,0.8444444444444454,0.781085694765685,55.08035714285714,54.526881720430104,54.627473702977355

This course will examine the nature of poverty in India and the development policies that have been formulated to eradicate it, both in the pre- and post-independence periods. We will begin the course with a discussion of the historical roots of India's development problem. The first week we will discuss the colonial economy, which created a deep and lasting legacy of inequities that persist in modern India. During the second week, we turn to the postcolonial state. This week will address the major political economy reforms initiated by Indira Gandhi in 1971 and 1991 in order to combat the legacy. In Week 3, the focus shifts to a consideration of contemporary debates on the role of globalization in exacerbating India’s economic and social problems (or, conversely, in providing an opportunity for economic growth and equity).

Abstract
India is an open economy which is dependent on exports as the share of imports in its GDP is 12.5% and 16.2% in the current and future year respectively. India’s share in world trade has been continuously increasing and is now at the 10th place after overtaking UK and Germany. It is interesting to note that Indian exports were only 1% of the world exports in 2000 which increased to 2.3% at current prices in year 2015.

India has witnessed a massive rise in the COVID-induced deaths in April and May which has been attributed to various factors including the second wave which affected the country in March and April, the lack of oxygen supply in various hospitals as well, among other factors.
However, as per the government’s estimates, India’ s death toll due to COVID stood at 2,59,000 as of 1st June as compared to 22,800 at the same period in 2020. However, there have been many reports of the deaths being under-reported. The actual death numbers are likely to be higher than the reported numbers which could lead to the real extent of impact of COVID on the economy and society.",106,194,0.5859872611464968,7.3423993371021234,0.8942976174667105,0.048136253593062873,0.8733333333333334,0.848721804511279,0.7984042681360857,59.40408494747708,58.88535031847134,51.53483544303798

This book is a study in applying the Congruent Model of Organisational Change to the Indian economy, and particularly, in examining the changes in economic policy during 1990s and the factors behind these changes. This book examines the impact of the globalisation on India and its implications for policy making and implementation. It also examines how these policies were influenced by the domestic political factors and what impact these factors had on policies. Further, this study has also examined how the policies influenced the various interest groups, both the formal - trade unions and industry associations and informal – corporate sector. In the final chapter, a tentative conclusion is reached by analysing the policy changes of this period.",111,186,0.5131578947368421,6.32663542409974,0.8671999281455246,0.06086599084747816,0.8466666666666667,0.8359375000000003,0.7414654987517685,45.1036036036036,42.75657894736842,38.41515311046767

Indian economy,a study on demonetisation and its impact on indian economy,"a study on demonetisation and its impact on indian economy
The impact of the decision by the Government of India to demonitise high-value currency notes in November 2016 on Indian economy has been the subject of extensive discussions and analyses in the Indian media and academic circles. While there has not yet been sufficient evidence to draw any firm conclusion, a few facts and trends, based on publicly available data, suggest that the economic impact so far has largely been negative. In particular, there appears to be a sharp decline in bank deposits, and this is likely to translate into further contraction in credit to the private sector. These developments are also affecting the overall economic growth and the fiscal deficit of both the central government as well as state governments. Further, the recent decline, which was sharper than anticipated, in exports has also adversely affected foreign exchange reserves. The impact is further compounded by a rise in global oil prices. This has led to an increase in overall",114,180,0.5752688172043011,7.845620653642402,0.8941935241460117,0.04662078536434592,0.8685714285714285,0.8795061728395053,0.7963374481366743,63.660714285714285,65.26881720430107,66.23594173441734

Indian economy,economic growth and unemployment rate: an empirical study of indian economy,"economic growth and unemployment rate: an empirical study of indian economy
AbstractThe Indian economy is growing at a fast pace and is expected to reach a per capita income of more than $2,000 by 2015. In spite of its rapid economic growth, the unemployment problem of India is a major concern in the recent times. The Indian unemployment rates are high and rising despite the fact that the economy has expanded by more and more employment opportunities. Therefore, this paper is an attempt to study the relationship between economic and employment growth in India, in an effort to ascertain the factors that are responsible for the increase in unemployment in Indian labour force and the impact of these factors on India’s economy.
The study uses a panel data set of 20 Indian states to investigate the determinants of unemployment, and it also studies the effect of economic activity and government’ policy initiatives on the growth of employment, during a period of time from 1981 to 2007. It is also an investigation into the extent",122,190,0.5052631578947369,6.964572001056112,0.8698927484791289,0.05709579634519001,0.8628571428571428,0.8660240963855428,0.7625978485167583,63.333333333333336,59.3,56.63118233267717

We investigate the sources of India' s rapid economic and population growth using total productivity, which includes the contributions from labor, capital, and the natural resource base. We use a production function that includes capital inputs, labor inputs and natural resources. Our model is estimated for two decades, 1951-80 and 1981 - 99 using annual data for a panel of 15 states in India. The results show that the share of growth in the capital-natural resource-labor input product (K) is 0.7% of GDP, while the labor-capital product is equal to 4.0% and total product to about 3.4%, implying that growth was mostly driven by capital and not labor. In both samples we find that a large share in growth of total output came from the contribution of labor and capital. Capital- and labor productivity have contributed ",123,183,0.48863636363636365,6.482493908421918,0.8614952295622839,0.06168068985891798,0.8571428571428571,0.8544736842105263,0.7665258428286477,46.46937999239255,47.49431818181818,46.55438785877571

The foreign capital inflows to emerging markets in the current decade have been substantial and the impact on the domestic economy is not clear. The impact is likely to be greater than in developed countries due to several factors. First, the developing countries are in a process of rapid growth and have high savings rates and hence, a higher multiplier for capital. Second, capital account liberalization has been a major factor, making the emerging economy capital accounts more transparent and stable. Third, many of the countries that have received significant capital flows also have large domestic markets, which are relatively less affected by the influx of capital from abroad.

This study investigates the relationship of exports, investment, and growth in the Indian economy, in order to assess the impact of changes in these variables to the growth of output in an effort to estimate the long-term equilibrium relationship among exports growth and investment growth. We find strong evidence that these two variables move together in a long run and a strong correlation. Moreover, the export-growth-investment correlation is positive and statistically significant. However, these results are subject to change in short run. The export growth has a positive impact on domestic demand and, consequently, on investment. Investment has an effect on growth both direct and indirect. In addition, our empirical results show the presence of a significant longterm correlation between export and domestic.

In fact it has crossed the 80 $. This sharp increase has made the life of an average Indian tough. With the prices of petrol and diesel on the rise. Inflation is rising fast and there is no sign of it abating.

this is the second of two volumes that provide a detailed examination of india's experience in promoting economic development and growth. the volume analyzes the indian state' s role in the economy and the nature of indian capitalism in its early period, and then explores the role of private sector in economic change. it looks at the performance of different sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, construction, transport, services, trade, banking, public spending, etc.
the authors show that, despite the state'intervening in almost every sector, its role as a catalyst to economic activity is not very significant. they demonstrate that the government has not succeeded in building up a strong, dynamic private industry to drive the economic transformation, even during the early 21st century.

This article first appeared in the July 1997 print edition of Business Line, the business paper published by The Hindu Group
The economic slowdown is now well over six months old and the Indian economy is at the cusp of a critical juncture. There are three broad scenarios that could materialize. The first scenario is the worst of them - a collapse of the government and a return to political chaos. This will be a disaster for the economy as it will mean a loss of credibility and confidence among foreign and domestic investors. A government collapse would also mean the end of all the reforms that have taken place in recent years and an immediate return of protectionism and cronyism. If this is avoided the second scenario, which is not as bad as the first one, may emerge. Under this scenario the current government may survive, but its ability to push through the needed structural reforms may be severely",134,182,0.5944444444444444,7.97530911974925,0.8998397191882809,0.04441160905614423,0.8571428571428571,0.8499999999999996,0.7954046054258952,59.43989224379841,67.84444444444445,50.5211815798099

Introduction:
Economic analysis has been a neglected subject in India in the past. A number of reasons account for this state of affairs. One, economic analyses of the Indian type, which could be used for the purpose of policy making, were not produced. There was a dearth of trained economists who could write on India. The other reason was the political economy of India which was in its formative stage. This meant that it had been the subject of much debate but had not yet crystallised as the science of economic development which it has since acquired. Finally, there has, in fact been an intellectual resistance to the study of economics in general and Indian economy in particular.
The first reason",136,193,0.5418994413407822,7.2501203996937775,0.881891409224367,0.05242622983011938,0.8285714285714285,0.844129032258064,0.7777606155341605,56.974127557160045,58.63687150837989,50.23796296296296

The Impact Of Inflation On The Indian Stock Market. 3.5 Impact on Economic Growth The main purpose of this research is to study the impact inflation and real interest rate on macro economic variables. However, the government should not be blamed for rising prices. This is because inflation will cause a rise in prices for most consumers and will thus reduce the purchasing power. Inflation is one important tool for monetary policy in a country and its impact is a vital area of investigation for economists and policy makers. A rise or fall in inflation is the change in the level of overall prices, which is measured in terms of a basket of goods and services.

Narendras Modi Government’s Economic Reforms
The Narendrasingh, who is also a minister in Modi’ government, in an interview to the Financial Times said, “We are trying to change the mindset from being an economy where you are afraid and cautious to one where the fear is not there”.
Modi has taken on many reforms since he became the prime minister. These include opening the retail sector, opening insurance sector for foreign players and making it easier for the poor to get government loans at lower interest rates. In 2014, Modi had also announced a demonetization of Rs 500 and Rs1000 notes to curb black money and counterfeit notes. The decision resulted in a sharp rise in digital transactions.

Abstract
The nineteenth-century transformation of India’s economy, as the “crisis” and the emergence of new forms of capitalism are often described, has long been recognized as one of the most significant economic developments of its period. The growth of industrial production and commercial activity, the expansion of foreign trade, and above all, agricultural transformation, are seen as fundamental in the process. This chapter will examine some issues involved in interpreting the nature and significance of these trends. These issues arise out of a consideration of their social context: the changing structure of society and of class relations, in particular. It will be argued that these transformations are best seen both as consequences and as agents of change in India, which in turn is best interpreted as an integral part of nineteenth and twentieth- century capitalism.",146,193,0.5443786982248521,7.076923076923077,0.8814576716485616,0.05320841859056482,0.7999999999999999,0.828413793103448,0.7591066294084077,50.440725244072524,46.40828402366864,47.67021340910465

Abstract
The paper examines the nexuses between carbon emission and economic output for India. The empirical results indicate strong relationship between CO2 emissions and output in the long run and short run. A long-run cointegrating relation and a short-term cointegrated relation exist between the variables. In longrun, the carbon intensity is the only variable that has significant impact on COE and the co-integrators of COI, COII and COIII are not significant. However, in short term there are two variables, carbon and carbon dioxide, which have significant effects on output. Moreover, there is a positive feedback between economic activities and pollution.

The recent trend for women social entrepreneurship has been on the rise, and many women have been coming up with social enterprises and social causes that aim to benefit the society, as well as the economy. This is an area that has seen a major transformation over the past few years, but is still at its nascent stage. However, the trend looks promising and is sure to take off soon, in a big way.

In 2006, the United Nations (UN) declared 2015 as the International Year for Micro-credit, and as part of this initiative, a Global Consultation Meeting was held in Delhi, India. The main aim of the meeting was to discuss the nexus that exists between Microcredit and financial Inclusion, which has been the cornerstone of microfinance. However, while the discussion focused more on microcredit as a financial service rather than financial access and the role it plays in the economy, it is clear that financial services are an important tool that can help in increasing financial Access.",153,182,0.6451612903225806,7.184212081070997,0.9090810516011535,0.043430785609637236,0.8999999999999999,0.8708000000000012,0.7925276560539622,66.92817723618731,70.29838709677419,63.51055164753795
Indian economy,does crude oil price affect the inflation rate and economic growth in india? a new insight based on structural var framework,"does crude oil price affect the inflation rate and economic growth in india? a new insight based on structural var framework
This study aims at analyzing the relationship between crude Oil price change, real GDP growth and Real Interest rate change with inflation. We also investigate the effects of crude price, Real GDP and interest rate changes on India's Inflation rate. To achieve the purpose, Structural VAR method is adopted. The results indicate that there is an unidirectional and negative relationship among crude, interest rates and real economic output. Also we have found that an increase in real interest leads to the growth of Inflation. Moreover, the results also confirm the fact that inflationary expectations play an important role in inflation and output growth, and the effect is stronger for inflation in India. Therefore, a decrease in the real rate of interest and a rise in oil prices are the two major factors behind inflation: 109-119

The book examines the political process of macroeconomic policy change, from the time the Congress Party came to power in March 1947 until the fall of the Rajiv Gandhi government in 1990. This time covers the 34 years of Indira Gandhi’s first term in office, which is generally considered as having been the most successful in terms of economic development. During this period, the Indian economy experienced a series of major macro-economic shocks that affected the growth rates and inflation levels. Despite these shocks, India maintained an average annual rate of growth of 4.6 percent over the whole period. The first major shock was brought about by the Sino-Indian war of August 1971, followed by a sharp devaluation of India’S currency in July 1980, and a subsequent rise in interest rates in September / October, when inflation reached its",157,184,0.6046511627906976,7.929925657295443,0.9022624346780211,0.04372011702968091,0.86,0.8656756756756753,0.8100349592836583,62.72322443091143,65.37790697674419,59.56911652703732

In addition, it also examines the moderating role of accounting accruals on performance and earnings quality of Indian companies listed on stock exchange. The study is a part of a large study on growth, earnings and cash flow forecasting of companies. A sample of 200 companies is drawn using secondary data for the period of five years from year 2010-2015 for testing the hypothesis. To check the effect of performance (growth and profitability) on accounting earnings, the study uses the panel data analysis.

The Indian Banking Industry was nationalised in 1969. Insurance sector is the 5th largest industry contributing to the country’s GDP. The insurance companies have to pay a part of their income to LIC. This is a very good thing because it has a direct link to India’ s economic growth. … This was one of India's largest privatization. In order to meet growing demand in the financial services sector, it is estimated that the industry will require 4,00,000 people by 2018. There is an increasing trend in terms of penetration of motor insurance and non-life insurance. It is also important that we look at some of its drawbacks. For example, an insurance policy that has not been renewed for five years would be cancelled and the insured would then lose the benefits of having taken the policy in first place.

Indian economy,interfuel substitution in the indian economy,"interfuel substitution in the indian economy
In this paper we present a model of interfuel substitute- tion. We analyze the conditions for a switch between a low- and a high-price fuel, which is motivated by the introduction of a second fuel into an otherwise fuel-monopoly economy in order to achieve an inter- fuel substitution, and we discuss its possible effects on welfare in an oligopolistic context. Our main result is that the model predicts a reduction of total consumption and of the share of high price fuel for low income households. However, for high income groups the substitution reduces total fuel consumption but it increases the shares of both fuels. The model also shows that fuel switching can be beneficial if it is preceded by a price increase. Finally, in contrast to the previous literature, we prove that in a monopoly the second price of oil and gas can increase welfare: 127-137

This paper empirically analyses the impact of organizational and contextual determinants on sustainable superior firm performance. The analysis is based on the data gathered through a survey of the top management of 200 companies from India. Using a multi-group path analysis, this study provides empirical evidence that the organizational variables – such as firm size, age, and growth rates (measured by the percentage growth in sales and profit during the last five years) -- are important determinants of superior firms’ sustainable growth. Further, the study also finds that external and internal contextual factors - such a country’s macroeconomic and industry growth & productivity, firm’ s access to capital, market size and intensity of rivalry ― have a significant impact on superior sustainable firm growth performance as well as on firm's growth and profitability.

Demonetisation is a step toward the elimination of black money. It would not be an exaggeration to say that demonetization is going to be a game changer for India. The objective behind the decision to demonitize notes of Rs. 500 and Rs 1000 was to curb the practice of Black Money.
The decision of demonisation was taken after long discussions and deliberations in the parliament. In fact the idea of bringing black economy into the tax net was a vision of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He had spoken about it even before his election and has been working for its successful implementation since his first tenure. But the implementation of this vision had become a matter of great debate. There were strong voices opposing it as it would affect the daily transactions of people. However, the PM and his team was convinced about its benefits. Finally the government took the bold step of making the move a reality. As a result of these decisions a new set",174,193,0.5833333333333334,8.082903768654761,0.8974803661073314,0.04489974104331334,0.8571428571428571,0.8573809523809514,0.7781624992600121,68.43373493975903,59.666666666666664,57.21579565472695

We use data of industrial growth, investment, savings, income and population for India between 1947 and 2007 to examine the role of investment in economic growth. We find that investment growth is a major contributor to sustained growth in output. Investment growth of 1% is found to lead to 0.2% rise in GDP, and the contribution of private investment to GDP has been much higher since 1960s than it was before. While the rate of growth has fluctuated, the level of savings has increased from 20% to about 30% of output over this period, with savings increasing significantly in the 1990: 49-58

Indian economy,measuring energy efficiency in the context of an emerging economy: the case of indian manufacturing,"measuring energy efficiency in the context of an emerging economy: the case of indian manufacturing industry
The paper studies energy and labour productivity in Indian manufacturing industries, and their relationship. This relationship is studied for various sectors, over the period 2001-2006, using the Balassa-Samuelson effect, energy productivity and energy labour ratio. The findings indicate that a positive, significant and increasing relationship exists between energy usage and productivity for the entire Indian economy. In addition, the relationship between the energy use and output is found to be more significant in case -of manufacturing sectors than in primary sector, while for both manufacturing and primary sectors it is negative at the early stage of development, but turns positive after a lag of 3-5 years. For a sub-set of manufacturing sector the impact of productivity is significantly higher than energy. However, in energy the impacts of labour and capital are more substantial, especially in manufacturing, than that of energy: 125-141

Indian economy,economic liberalisation and indian agriculture: a statewise analysis,"economic liberalisation and indian agriculture: a statewise analysis using rabi cropping data
The paper investigates the impact of agricultural liberalization in the Indian economy. Using state-level data covering the pre-liberalization and post-liberization periods for major crops, the study examines whether the benefits of liberalizations in terms of higher growth and employment are being fully realized by different states or if they are concentrated in particular regions. We find that the growth of gross value added (GVA) per worker is significantly associated with agricultural reform measures, implying that agricultural growth is being stimulated by policy reforms; however, it is not uniform across states. This is corroborated by the results of the regression of GVA per farmer on agricultural reforms, which show that reforms have not significantly increased the productivity of farmers. The results are robust to the inclusion of state dummies in different regressions. In general, agricultural policies in India have been more liberalized in states with relatively higher levels of industrial",185,188,0.554945054945055,7.4866180982771215,0.8868398513595444,0.050069280661679254,0.8628571428571429,0.8549367088607599,0.7912098511548329,60.666666666666664,59.35164835164835,58.20095050215208

The budget 2019-20 is a big opportunity for India to consolidate its position as a growth engine. This is because the government has a clear mandate, with a stable majority on both sides of the house. It has also been given a clean chit by all major credit rating agencies after the GST and the RERA bills passed through the parliament.
It is time to take stock of how well the fiscal consolidation process has progressed over the past three years. There are three main factors that need to be assessed. The first is the progress on fiscal deficit; the second are the steps to improve tax collection; and third – the measures to reduce government borrowing.

The study is based on the data for 1981-2009 from 24 countries. We examine the long-run relationship between the growth of energy demand, GDP and CO2 emissions using the cointegration technique and the Granger’s Causality test. The long run relationship among variables is found to be weak (in the range -0.15 to 0.14). The Granger Causal test also finds no causal relationship either in the weak or strong direction, except for the case of India.

Future Ready Banking with Smart Contracts
With blockchain and cryptocurrencies making the news almost daily, one of the key areas where blockchain is gaining ground is smart contract technology.
What is a smart Contract?
A smart-contract is an agreement between two or more parties that is executed automatically, without the involvement of a third party. In a nutshell, it’s a piece of code which automatically executes when certain conditions are met. It’ll perform actions automatically (pay a sum of money, for instance) without a human to intervene. This makes the smart agreement extremely cost effective and efficient. Smart-Contracts were introduced by the Bitcoin blockchain as a way to execute transactions automatically. Since then, the concept of smart agreements has been expanded into different fields like healthcare and education. A typical example is the application of blockchain in the healthcare sector for the purpose of sharing health related data between multiple stakeholders. The blockchain has the potential to transform a large range of industries",196,194,0.5665024630541872,8.071417672951359,0.8930450178441938,0.046351101106345154,0.88,0.8692737430167587,0.800043640576013,60.16437234913312,62.891625615763544,56.44380952380952

Indian economy,why poverty persists in india: a framework for understanding the indian economy,"why poverty persists in india: a framework for understanding the indian economy
- Author: S. Seshadri, Romesh Kumar
Published on 2010-07-12T14:53:05Z (GMT) by
A framework to explain the paradox of persistent poverty in India is proposed. The framework is based on four key factors: the level of income inequality within states, the distribution of public expenditure across states in rural India, and the extent of fiscal autonomy of states. We argue that the low level in the income distribution in states and low levels of inter-state public transfers in most Indian states are major causes for high poverty.

The Indian economy is growing at its fastest pace in over two years, and the government is looking forward to increasing the private sector investment. This has led to the rise of the Indian PE investment market. The investment in the PE sector in 2014 rose by 20.6%, with $2.4 billion invested in India. With the new PE regulations in place, the amount has been growing, with the number of PE firms also increasing. However, there are still many PE funds in need of funds.

What are the key challenges in making a PE fund investment? In addition to a good investment portfolio, private fund investors also need a strong management track record. In particular, these funds must be capable of raising sufficient capital from both foreign and domestic investors. Moreover, Indian private funds should have a proven track history.

Using data from the Business Group Survey Panel of the Reserve Bank of India, we find that firms belonging to the same group tend to be similar in terms of diversification, capital intensity and firm size. We find some evidence that the diversification behaviour of firms varies across the groups. The data also suggest that groups have responded to increased competition by increasing investment in capital goods and by diversifying into newer and more productive industries. However, despite these improvements in performance, many firms are not able to maintain their competitiveness. (05)

- Category Business
The impact of the goods and service tax on the economy of India can be analyzed by the following factors;
Impact on economic activities-
GST is an indirect tax levied on goods (except alcohol and tobacco) and is a consumption tax. It is paid by consumers at the point of final consumption, and thus the burden does not fall entirely on producers. This makes it easier for the government to collect.
As an effect, it reduces tax evasion, since tax collection is not based on physical delivery. Also, as it is levying on a product rather than a person, there are more chances of it being collected. However, the collection of GST is also dependent on how well the administration of tax works. If the system is corrupt, tax avoidance is quite possible. Hence, GST may not be as good for tax revenue",220,180,0.5054347826086957,6.856050961202716,0.8691573019935769,0.05777184225464838,0.8228571428571428,0.8275000000000008,0.7397829128521107,44.78435517970402,46.58695652173913,46.930487384827344

Oil price shock and its impacts on economy of a country is an important phenomenon in the world of economics. In the present research, we have studied and analyzed the effect of oil price volatility shocks and oil-exporting-country shocks in a dynamic setting using the Markov regression models. Our findings indicate that the oil exporters have been experiencing the volatility in oil prices as compared to that of exporters of other major commodities. The oil export economy is more vulnerable to shocks of commodity prices. We have also found that shocks to the prices of non-oil exporting countries, especially the ones with high per capita income, are significantly higher than that to oil exporting ones. Thus, the policy makers should focus more on the non oil sector.

1. The nature of data - The first problem that faces us is the availability or lack of availability of reliable data. Even in developed countries, the data may not be completely reliable due to the inherent problems associated with data collection and recording in developing countries and also due the fact that the labour force in these nations is not adequately represented by the official records. It would be very useful to have a reliable source for the collection of such data in countries like India. There is, however, an urgent need to develop such a source.

Indian economy,growth cycles in the indian economy,"growth cycles in the indian economy
The Indian economy has undergone several phases of growth and recession throughout its 66 year history. The first phase of economic growth in India started with the beginning of the independence movement. In the 1950s the economy was growing by about 5.0% per year, but the country's per capita income remained low because the population was still large.
As India grew, its population grew as well. By the end of this phase, the Indian population had grown to 300 million in 1960. During this period, India' economy grew at a moderate rate. But the growth was not sustainable because of India’s lack of natural resources, and the government had to take various initiatives to boost the economic development and growth. It was only after 1970, that the rate of GDP (GDP per person) grew by 10 times to about USD 500. India continued to grow at this rate for almost two decades, until it was forced to cut its",234,200,0.5106382978723404,7.001519591898939,0.8716506788134264,0.056438176104675504,0.8514285714285714,0.8609756097560967,0.7720998137195717,51.5512104283054,56.71808510638298,50.812567772717415

This paper analyses the role of two different factors - distance and socio-economic status of households -- on the decision to use public health facilities in India. The analysis focuses mainly on three states where large sample surveys exist. Using the Demographic and Health Surveys 2012 for 22 states, this study estimates the probability of institutional delivery and its determinants — distance, economic characteristics of the household and health characteristics. Results suggest that distance does matter, but the effects are not uniform across all the states. While the distance from the home to the delivery site has a negative effect on institutional deliveries, the same does not hold for the quality of care at the facility or maternal and foetal health. In fact, it is the socio economic conditions of rural India that seem to be driving decisions to deliver at home or at public facilities.

In 1995 the losses were about 7%. This has been further improved by the use of advanced power electronics. This is the main cause of loss. The main sources of the non – technical loss are (i) theft/losses, … The technical and economic consequences of these losses are as follows. Technical losses: Non-Technical: A. 4. In this study a comparative analysis of technical losses and their economic significance is carried out. It has a very significant economic and technical consequence on the system. These losses account for more than 50 per cent of total power losses which are due to non technical causes.

Abstract
This thesis investigates the effects of slavery on the economic productivity of British colonies during the early 19th Century. It examines how the British abolitionists of Slavery in 1833 affected the West Indian economy. The research uses a historical macroeconomic framework of growth. Data is sourced mainly from secondary sources. Using a time-series analysis, I find that the growth rate of GDP per head and per worker increased after abolition. Moreover, the per capita GDP, which was lower than that of Britain in every decade since 1800, grew significantly to catch up with Britain’s by the end of 1900. In 1840 the annual real output of West India per adult was 30 percent lower relative to Britain. By the year 2000 West Indies had caught up and overt",240,194,0.6358695652173914,8.625354435061482,0.9131797890030351,0.03833430226259719,0.8514285714285714,0.8675,0.8241958198079333,69.63888888888889,81.09782608695652,76.02319902319903

The growth of the Indian economy is well documented in the popular media. The rapid growth in GDP is the subject of frequent comment in newspapers, magazines and other media and is a topic of conversation in homes, offices and factories across the country. There is no doubt that the growth rate has been very high, averaging over 6% between 2003 and 2010, and has exceeded the rate achieved in most other large countries.
However, this growth has not been evenly distributed between different sections of society and between areas of production within the domestic economy. For example, there has long been an ‘East-West regional inequality gap’ in India. According to the 73rd round of NSSO survey data, the per capita annual income of a person living in an urban household in Delhi is more than twice that of someone living elsewhere.

India’s economy has grown at a very rapid rate over the last decade, but this has not been matched by the development of other areas. In the early 1990’S there was a lot of talk about India’ s development, and how India had a chance of becoming as strong as Japan. The Indian economy was growing at over 7 percent per year, it had very good exports to the USA, Europe, UK and other major markets, the Indian stock markets were doing well and foreign direct investment (FDI) in India was increasing.
This all seemed very promising, until the financial crisis of the late 80’ S and early nineties hit. There was talk of India being a new tigers and that there would be an economic revolution in Asia. But India suffered just the same as the rest of Asia did. It took the Asian countries a long time",256,181,0.5628415300546448,7.613979090832101,0.8896710447539449,0.04876523331127607,0.9028571428571429,0.8920754716981127,0.8023456881061432,82.79566210045662,78.24043715846994,77.62587587587588

In India the number of infected cases of Covid-19 is growing at a rate of about 1000 per day. It may take another four months to get to a stage where the virus has run its course. If the rate continues at the same level, we may get close to 500,000 cases by the time the crisis has subsided. We are in for a very long haul, which will continue for at least another year with all kinds of economic disruptions and a deep recession to be expected.
As the disease spreads across the country, it will spread across social strata and age groups. The impact of an economic slowdown will be felt by all stratas of society. While the middle and lower classes are likely to suffer more than the higher middle class or the wealthy, the rich and upper middle classes too would be affected by a slowdown. They would suffer in terms of employment opportunities and in the prices of their assets. However, they will not suffer as much as the poor",261,200,0.5615763546798029,8.001231432316999,0.8914012494672091,0.0470634613227775,0.875,0.8800000000000003,0.8125202873704271,57.68782880766864,65.78817733990148,56.87921129503408

Abstract
The Indian economy is witnessing an economic boom after the liberalization of its economy in 1990. The country is moving ahead towards a knowledge-based society. It is also moving towards the globalization and liberalized economy, which will require a skilled and educated workforce. In this context, India is experiencing a major challenge to provide the much needed employment to its growing population, especially in agriculture. Agricultural labor is facing the problem of declining labor supply due to the changing demographic pattern of labor, changing attitude to work and increasing educational levels of rural youth. This research project has focused on the issue of agricultural labor in Indian agriculture, more specifically on how to improve the productivity of Indian agricultural workforce, and how the cooperative movement can contribute to it.

This paper empirically analyzes whether the FDI and trade-openness affect Economic Growth (Eg) in India. Using annual data on Fdi and total trade for 1980-2008, and a standard production function – with the use of Cobb-Douglas function, the paper estimates the relationship between economic open-ness and growth through the standard cointegration technique. The findings suggest that economic openness has a significant long run and transitory effect on growth in Indian context. This study shows that, a 10 percentage point increase in Fii inflows is associated with a rise of 0.25% in annual GDP growth.

THE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF INDIA UNDER THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
(1)
I. Introduction
Since the establishment of British hegemony in India in 1858, the country has been passing through a period of transition, from the traditional social and economic system to the modern industrial society. The process of industrialisation in the Indian economy has its own special features, which are different from what is happening in most of the Western countries. In the first place, it has occurred much earlier in our history than it did in other countries and, secondly, its pace has not been as steady as in some other parts of Asia. Thirdly, while it was",270,195,0.5649717514124294,7.516460280028289,0.8896902956665786,0.049070736731647274,0.84,0.8122875816993465,0.7747281289977119,43.14595808383233,47.112994350282484,42.71854441854442

Indian economy,"regional inequalities, economic growth and liberalisation: a study of the indian economy","regional inequalities, economic growth and liberalisation: a study of the indian economy, 2000-2015. In this paper, I will analyse the economic development of India from 1975-1985 and from the liberalization era of 1990s. The Indian economy is the seventh largest in the world in purchasing power parity terms. This paper presents the evolution and analysis of economic and population growth in India using data from Census of india, World Bank and National Sample Survey of Statistics. I have analysed the data on growth using Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and the Granger Causality tests. For these tests, the variables selected as the dependent variable, namely the real GDP growth, are the most appropriate as they represent the performance of economy. India has made remarkable progress in economic, social and human development during this period. There has been a significant improvement in all indicators and it is expected that this trend will continue in future.

The textile industry is a very vast industry which covers a variety of sectors such as spinning, weaving, knitting, apparel, home textiles and many more. Textile industry plays an extremely significant role in the economic development of a country as it provides employment, revenue and economic growth. India is one of the world’s leading producers as well as exporters of natural and synthetic man-made fibers. The textile sector contributes 13% to India’ exports. It is the second largest employer in India after agriculture. In the last five year, India has shown a tremendous growth in its textile export which has gone from $ 12 billion in FY14 to 21 billion dollars in 2018.

According to an article published in Economic Times, the Indian textile and apparel industry will grow at 7.5 percent in fiscal year (FY) 2022-23.

The Indian economy in the 50 years (1950-99) after independence has shown a marked growth. The per capita income rose by 2.7% per annum. But, the employment growth rate has been very slow, especially in recent years. In 1998-89, there was a decline in growth of per capital income as the GDP growth slowed down to less than 4%. At the same time, growth in employment slowed considerably and the unemployment rate rose from 7.2% in 1983-84 to 11.5% by March,1999. This is despite the fact that the labour force participation rate increased from around 35% to more than half during this period. There are two important reasons for this slow growth and employment decline. First, during the second phase, a new set of problems arose. Second, in addition to these factors,",278,182,0.5340909090909091,7.0855165975774455,0.8786981618413229,0.05401966325879428,0.8628571428571429,0.8928947368421051,0.7825749248897383,64.09843487293014,58.35227272727273,60.70304347826087

Abstract
This paper presents evidence on price adjustment in an open economy, using a vector error correction model of real output and prices for India. The results show that prices are not flexible in response to changes in relative prices but are flexible with respect to real variables. Price rigidities may explain the low responsiveness of the price levels to relative price changes. There is a negative long-term relationship between relative real wages and relative relative consumer prices. This suggests the existence of downward nominal rigidity. An explanation for this is provided on the basis of an investment function for real wage determination and the assumption that nominal wages are determined in terms of relative productivity.

The paper presents the results of a model, which describes the dynamics of national, regional and infrastructure production system. The model takes account of technological progress, population, and environmental degradation. These variables are related to the production functions, the demand for infrastructure and their prices. In a national system, it is assumed that a country is a homogeneous unit and the infrastructure supply is determined by the prices prevailing in the economy and technological change. A regional system takes into account the regional nature, i.e., the spatial nature of infrastructure requirements and its demand. It is shown theoretically, as well as empirically that the model is capable of capturing the dynamic interaction of factors affecting infrastructure demand and supply and hence provides a useful model for the analysis of long term infrastructure planning. Further, a simulation analysis is carried out to study the interaction between infrastructure, technological advance and population",280,194,0.46,6.505382386916237,0.8534386040364885,0.06369382243590441,0.845,0.8247727272727275,0.7326785973734268,44.80297418869638,46.39,41.42520113979216

This is about the history of political, economic, social, and cultural changes of India from the period of independence until recently. This is not about a history which is based on a linear development, rather a historical development which has changed in its structure, direction, or form of development.
It is important to distinguish between the'slow process of change' in the political and economic sphere, as well as in other spheres, such as the social sphere. In the case of economic development in particular, the development has not always been linear. Sometimes there have been periods of stagnation and periods with rapid growth. For example, from 1980 until 1990 the Indian economy grew at an average of 5.5 percent. The average annual growth rate in 2007/2008 was 8.2 percent. [ 1 ] There were periods in which the economy stagnated",282,187,0.5113636363636364,6.784005252999681,0.8702879023798354,0.057765025991338655,0.8457142857142858,0.8207894736842106,0.768717064655147,46.92189819581169,47.96022727272727,41.89433370247323

A country’s economy, as we will see in this paper, encompasses a wide range of factors such as population, natural resources, labor, government, capital, and technology. All of these factors have a role in a nation’ economy. For instance, a high population can contribute to a higher GDP. It will have more workers to increase the production of goods and services. However, an increased population would have an impact on the country. This would affect its labor force.

The agriculture sector is a large contributor to India's overall economy. It contributes 17.4% to the Indian GDP which is almost 50% higher than the world average.

There are a number of factors that influence agricultural productivity, such as the quality of seeds and fertilizers available, as well as access to water and land. In order to improve productivity in India, it is important to invest in the agricultural sector and ensure that farmers are given the tools needed to be successful.

The study also examines how various macro economic variables – such as Gross National Product [GNP], Gross Domestic Investment {GDI}, Gross Capital Formation [(GCF), Net National Savings - NNS), and Trade Balance -- affect Indian Stock Prices. The results indicate that macro-economic variables significantly affect stock markets in India. It is found that the macro variables, in general, positively affect the stock market.

The Indian society has its own culture and traditions. 2. The economic growth rate of India is higher as compared to the other countries of the world. India' s development has not been a smooth or a straight process. In 1979, the government of Prime Minister Morarji Desai passed the Land Acquisition Act, which provided for a fair compensation to people who were dispossessed of their land. It was not until 1942 that the first Indian economist was appointed to serve in the Reserve Bank as a consulting economist. This is also a major factor in hindering the overall growth of Indian companies, as most of them are owned and run by families. A major economic issue that is affecting India today is their growing population. One is that it is a country of many ethnic groups each with their own language and culture.

Abstract
This paper is a critical reading of the 2003 Telugu political blockbuster, ‘Chandanaraju’, which is also known as “Shamiripura,” and the Telugu TV drama series (2009-14) - 'Chanda' and ""Chinna Chinna Kamaanukku"". The paper argues that, both the films and drama, though they have different narrative styles, they both share the same ideological project of building a nation, a state, and a people — a project that is built on the ideal of shared sovereignty and which also seeks to re-envision the past in a way that will benefit the future, or in other words, the nation as well as the state. The films’ [Chadha and Chanda] and TV series’ ideological agenda, in turn,",303,181,0.5272727272727272,6.77294081420525,0.8746486114045684,0.05652865668881696,0.8133333333333334,0.8116312056737588,0.7718048462476015,49.572145729865895,47.872727272727275,35.54716981132076

I will need to see your model. However, I would say that the data in the United States does not support Wagner’s Law. There are so many factors involved that would affect the wages.
- What type of work is the job in question. Is it a skilled position that requires education and training? If so, that might affect how much money you could expect to make as an individual. If you were to compare a high school graduate with the skills to a college graduate in an office job, then they would not make nearly the amount. Also, if the office worker had an MBA then that person would get paid more. A job that required a degree would be paid less. The same is true for jobs that are considered to have a very",306,187,0.5431472081218274,7.623434348706332,0.884468794766337,0.050352105390077964,0.8971428571428571,0.8751445086705201,0.8051571589765216,57.401472043542796,63.09644670050761,67.9631969047175

Indian economy,push or pull? drivers of female labor force participation during india's economic boom,"push or pull? drivers of female labor force participation during india's economic boom
This paper investigates the relationship between the female wage premium and the level of economic development in India for the period 1979-97. We find a negative relationship for all but two of the four periods. The negative coefficient suggests that women are not pushed out of labor by rising wages or rising employment opportunities for men, nor are they pulled out by increased educational opportunities. Rather than being pushed into a job by economic growth, women appear to be pulled in because they have the opportunity to work. This is consistent with the view that economic expansion in the developing world provides the opportunities women want. ()

This paper investigates the relationship between financial development and its impact on the Indian economy during the post 1991 reforms period. The Indian financial market has evolved from the 1960s to today. Financial market liberalization in the form of foreign equity participation, and the creation of a secondary market through the introduction of trading system on exchanges have been a significant part of this process. A VAR model is estimated using monthly data for the period between 1980Q2 and 2007Q4. In addition, a VECM model with financial depth as proxy for financial intermediation has been used in order to assess the effects of financial deregulation on India's financial sector. Finally, the effect of de-regulation has also been assessed by the use of an ARMA model. These empirical studies provide evidence that financial markets in India can be characterized by a positive relationship with GDP growth during both the pre- and post-",317,187,0.5485714285714286,7.256917881777163,0.8837439178530867,0.05182974145935792,0.8857142857142858,0.8704635761589404,0.7866396450614256,62.866087104955135,58.93714285714286,53.342678373893804
Indian economy,economic inequalities and poverty in india: an interpretative overview,"economic inequalities and poverty in india: an interpretative overview of social stratification in India
The present study has tried to present an interpretation of the social and economic structure of India from the point of view of stratified societies. This attempt may, at best, constitute an introductory chapter of a much more ambitious research. The present interpretation is confined to the Indian case, which may be considered a typical case in its social, economic and institutional structure. It was a colonial society, with one group of colonisers - the Portuguese who arrived there first, followed by the Dutch and the English, who succeeded the former and finally by British -- with the later two sharing a common language (English) and religion. In this context we may try to interpret social structure through four broad parameters. These are population structure; stratifications of wealth and income; the role of institutions; and patterns of power and authority.

Dear friends and colleagues,
I thought I would share this interesting article with you all. It is written by
Dr. Kalyani Shankar and Dr Sudhir Chandra. They are both economists at the
University of California Berkeley and are well-known experts on India. Their
paper was published in the journal World Development in 2007. The article
provides a very balanced overview of the Indian diaspora and its impact on
the Indian economy. While there are some areas that I disagree with, overall
it is a wonderful piece of work. I hope you enjoy it too!

About India's Future :
India is now in the process of making the transition into a twenty- first century economy in a world economy. This transition is being driven by a number of factors, among which are rapid growth, the increasing integration of the Indian economy into the world and regional economy and trade, a large number and a rising percentage of young people, increasing urbanization, rapidly increasing energy consumption, climate change and its impacts (especially on agriculture), an expanding transport infrastructure, growing environmental issues in all sectors, including agriculture, water, forests and energy generation, rising demand for energy, especially by the poor — who also have the most to lose from climate impacts, gender issues related to poverty and environment, demographic trends,and the need for greater equity and justice within the country.

Abstract:
This paper examines the relationship between Digitization of trade and employment creation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the role of Digitisation of Trade and E-Commerce in creating employment in an economy. A time series econometric model is developed to test the hypothesis that digitisation and electronic commerce have a significant impact on employment. Results show that ecommerce has a positive impact upon employment and also it helps to create employment for rural and semi-urban areas. Digitized trade has also shown a direct relationship with employment; it has been seen that in India, trade digitised with China, has increased the employment rate in the economy, thereby reducing the unemployment rate and increasing the economic prosperity of the country.Keywords: digitized Trade, employment, e commerce, China.",329,191,0.5088757396449705,6.615384615384615,0.8683109635860138,0.05910939552773251,0.8466666666666667,0.8524137931034488,0.7777345005355694,49.12785999474024,47.112426035502956,48.41453537936914

Abstract
In this paper, based on a detailed analysis of the Indian employment data from 1983-94, we study the evolution of informal employment in India. We argue that the recent increase of non-agricultural informally employed population should not be seen as a sign of worsening economic performance, as some recent studies suggest. Rather it should be interpreted in a context in which informal sector is increasingly seen to be a source for positive growth effects through the creation of new job opportunities, and its positive impact on growth in terms of productivity, income and inequality reduction is growing. Our results show that, although informal labour share is increasing in Indian economy, the positive effects on economic development of this employment growth still prevail. In order to better understand the nature of positive employment effects of informa1 employment, in this work we also provide an analysis on the employment characteristics of formal and informal sectors in rural and",333,183,0.5260416666666666,7.289047148519026,0.8778173237005129,0.053511413546105786,0.8514285714285714,0.8859523809523812,0.787687957664267,64.51612903225806,60.4375,64.12978875760831

Introduction
The Indian economy is currently in a state of deep shock and
shivering following the 8 April shocker by the Indian stock
exchange and the rupee, with the latter falling by as much as
25% in the following weeks, before being capped by Reserve
Bank of India [RBI] intervention. This has led to the government
of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh'resign' and a series of
unprecedented measures being announced. The government has
also announced the setting up of a special high powered
committee headed by eminent economist C. Rangaraj to suggest
measures to boost growth and investment.

In view of this, the authors of these articles analyse the impact that growth in services has had on the economy and its sustainability, in a country like China, with its ‘new economic growth’ paradigm. The authors then examine how this growth pattern is applicable to the case of India. They analyse a number of indicators that measure the sustainability of growth.

The present paper examines the linkage between the financial access to rural poor and their economic development, through a micro-level analysis using the data from the household survey. The analysis of this paper is based on the assumption that the access of rural households to banking and microfinance institutions can improve the living conditions of poor households by providing them with financial services. In particular this study aims to identify the impact of micro financing on income generation and poverty reduction of households. For this purpose, a regression model for the poverty status of a household is estimated. A two-stage least squares estimation procedure is used to test the hypothesis. Empirical results reveal that access and use of financial service by poor farmers has positive and significant impact on their income and on household poverty. Further, the results indicate that for each 10 percentage point increase in the number of banks in a district / village, household per capita income increases by 0.03 – ",347,189,0.5282051282051282,7.375983202606159,0.8789549357542593,0.05285730776519648,0.88,0.886315789473682,0.7954699854336988,71.45250599383492,72.51282051282051,65.50038231171149

About 40 Indian companies have grown to be the multibillion-dollar multilocation global corporations. They have also been the source of 60% of the exports in India. The Indian government has encouraged the growth of such companies and has created various incentives for them to expand their operations abroad. It is argued that these companies can provide the resources and capabilities to develop the domestic infrastructure, which will help to reduce the trade barriers and increase the country’s exports.
The Indian multinational companies in this book are analysed by looking at their performance in terms of growth, investment, employment and export performance. These companies are also evaluated against other multinational corporations operating in similar industries. This paper argues that Indian multinations have contributed positively to the Indian economy as a whole. However, it is also found that the benefits of these multinas are not spread evenly throughout the society. There is a need for the government to focus on improving the infrastructure",349,192,0.538860103626943,7.486083807786423,0.882512694540323,0.05140422644255706,0.8971428571428571,0.8915976331360941,0.7848385681974664,75.0215674012737,69.61658031088083,66.89539007092199

the economy is the engine of our society and it is in dire need of re-engineering. the first step of this reimagining must be in rethinking the nature of government’s role in the economy.
we need to move away from our current model of state intervention (which is often too interventionist) to a model that is more inclusive. this means more private participation in public sector projects, and greater autonomy and freedom of action for public-sector employees. it also means a greater emphasis on the private sector’ s participation. in fact, the government should be the driver of development. but this will also require a fundamental change in mindset. instead of viewing the state as a hindrance to economic growth, we need it to be a partner in economic development and prosperity. we must recognize that the role of the public in an economy should not be limited to providing social services. rather, it should include providing economic infrastructure for development, supporting innovation, encouraging private-public",350,199,0.4900990099009901,6.965615692829889,0.8656533754663966,0.058275986174659324,0.855,0.8766292134831449,0.7801984867208271,55.76667105626207,57.95049504950495,57.04432062808661

The most recent major economic development is China’s rise as an economic power. It has become the world’ second largest economy, behind the United States, with its 2016 GDP totaling $11.2 trillion. China is now an important trade partner with the U.S., as well as a leading producer for many other countries. In 1980, China had been the 13th largest producer of goods, but that ranking fell to the fifth-largest in 2008. By 2050 it is expected to be the third largest. This rapid growth is due to China being able to manufacture goods much more cheaply than many developed nations, due in part to its lack of environmental regulations. Because of its cheap labor, many manufacturing jobs in the west have",351,193,0.5842696629213483,7.795129565556959,0.89629195315956,0.04608386289405409,0.8685714285714285,0.8677922077922084,0.7988181539352872,59.333333333333336,60.674157303370784,59.32002001412762

This paper examines the tradeoff b etween inflation rate and the rate of unemployment using monthly inflationary data from the period January 2000 to December 2010, for India. Using the Johansen cointegration test, the long-run relationship between the two variables was found to be statistically insignificant at 5 percent level of significance. In short- run, a positive and significant relationship was observed between both the variables, which implies that a trade-off does exist between these two macroeconomic variables in India during the post reform period.",355,187,0.6153846153846154,6.656402354702749,0.8980491215925486,0.049294833841178436,0.88,0.8731182795698931,0.8031650642287755,58.46339173967459,58.27350427350427,57.6551724137931

This article explores the impact of capital inflow on the economic variables of a country by studying the capital flows and the macro economic parameters of an economy. The paper also tries to explore the determinants of these capital flow.
Capital flows are those which occur when one country borrows or invests its money in another country. Foreign capital investment in one's economy is called capital influx. If the economy of one particular country experiences capital outflow, it is said to be capital deflows. It means there is a capital movement of money from a high yielding economy to another economy with lower yielding potential. In other words, a flow of funds from one capital account to the other capital accounts. Capital inflations and outflows are the most important factor which affects a nation' s economic condition. These infl and def of foreign capital are influenced by many external factors, like interest rates, exchange rate, inflation rate etc. A change in these external economic variable may also",363,193,0.472636815920398,6.700783350656684,0.8586866059087646,0.0613553473382992,0.825,0.8253107344632777,0.759747676434745,46.03439597315436,41.985074626865675,39.60891511998136

Indian merchants in Natal, and in some parts of the Transvaal, are called duka walahs, from their special trade in Indian goods, such as cloths, beads, bangles, jewellery, etc. The Natal traders were mostly settled on the Indian frontier, where their wares were eagerly sought after, since the native population was in constant want of these things as the result of a system of barter.

AbstractThis paper studies the link between the liberalisation of India's economy and stock prices by examining the returns to the acquirer and target in takeovers, using a unique sample of 1200 acquisitions over a twenty year period. We find that, in the short term, there is a negative association between liberalization of economic activity and acquirers' and targets' returns on the day of the takeover announcement. However, this negative relationship is not sustained over time. Our findings suggest that the initial negative impact of liberalizing reforms on acquire 2006-02.

This paper investigates the causal relationship between per capita energy use (PCEU) and GDP, with the objective of analyzing the impact of energy on GDP growth. The study is motivated by the fact that India has the highest growth of per-capita energy consumtion, and is among the fastest growing economies with a per capital energy usage that was 0.2 percent of global energy demand in 2011. A long-run relationship is estimated with co-integration technique. An error correction model - ECM is then employed to estimate short-term dynamics of the two variables, which also confirms a long –run causal link between the variables. It is therefore concluded that there is no short run relationship among energy, GDP and per –.",368,195,0.55625,7.036067793874643,0.8844300773027487,0.05243358964424053,0.8933333333333332,0.8926470588235295,0.7928411549744009,71.30434782608697,66.7375,60.472623138602515

This dissertation examines the problem that American Indian reservations experience, the collective nature of the challenge, and the role of American government institutions to address this challenge. American Indians experience a lower level of living than the non-Indian population. The reasons for this lower standard of life are not simple and can be attributed to a combination of factors such as low human capital, a lack of access to land and credit, limited economic diversification, as well as the legacy of Indian policy and culture. This work uses the theory of public choice to develop a model that explains how American reservations can experience low standard living and why this is the current situation.

The services sector, which is the backbone of the country, is growing at a pace of about 7% in terms of GDP.
It’s a good thing that services are on such a roll, but what about the other sectors?In fact, they are still struggling to recover from the financial crash.This means that they will be unable to grow as quickly as the manufacturing and construction sectors.As such, the growth in services will likely slow down, leading to a slump in the economy, especially as demand for labour is falling.However, despite all this, it is still possible for these sectors to expand in a sustainable way, provided that the government can provide the right environment and incentives.For one thing, there is a huge demand in India for skilled, educated and trained labour, and this is reflected in its labour-force participation rate, one of India’S highest.In 2015-",374,185,0.5212765957446809,7.147384583396834,0.8755883310110633,0.05470669902232967,0.8228571428571428,0.8507317073170737,0.7667356762053688,48.80769230769231,50.90425531914894,50.91627622303828

In a study conducted in the 1990s, Kharas (1999) showed that oil prices are a very important determinant of inflation. 1.1 Introduction. Inflationary Effect of Oil Price Shocks: The oil shock of1973 and the oil shocks of1980 and 1988 had a significant impact on the economy both in terms of short term and long term impact. In 1974, the price of a barrel of crude oil was around $6. This price increase was due to oil exporting countries raising their prices to the United States to help pay for its war in Vietnam. Oil shocks have an inflationary effect as well as an exchange rate shock. The impact of price increases is not only a function of the magnitude of these increases...

The planning function can be said to be a major contributor to economic growth. As such, it can contribute to the overall development of the nation and also to social justice. But the question is how? The planning process has three important stages. The first stage is preparation of a development plan. This is followed by the implementation of that plan and finally, by evaluation of its progress and making amendments to it. It is a continuous process. For the success of this process, the first step is very important for which, of course, a planning body is needed. That planning … The Planning Commission of India is India's apex body that is responsible for the formulation and implementation in consultation and co-ordination with State Governments and other concerned authorities of policies and programmes that are aimed at the economic development.

Abstract:
This paper assesses the impact of the economic liberalization and structural adjustments programmes in India, with special reference to agriculture. It is argued that in spite of many setbacks, there has been significant progress. The reforms, although incomplete, have been a success in terms of increasing output and employment. A major constraint to the success of economic reform, however, has not been lack of progress, but rather the political resistance of those who benefit from the current system of patronage. This resistance is now weakening, which is a positive sign for future growth and development prospects in the country.

Defining the difference between the current accounts and the balance of payments is the first step in understanding the connection between them. The current balance refers to the sum of the transactions that occur in a particular period of time, whereas an accounts balance is a summary of all transactions of a country during a specific time period. When there is more money leaving a nation than coming in, that is called a current deficits. It occurs when there are more imports than exports. A current surplus, on the contrary, refers that exports of any good are greater in amount than the imports of that good. Current surfeit is when the country imports less than it exports and there exists a positive balance. These differences in the accounts lead to differences between countries in international trade. Countries that have large current balances or deficits have to spend more in order to",405,189,0.4387755102040816,6.142857142857143,0.8439277249242053,0.06808675393034802,0.8228571428571428,0.8176744186046513,0.7359428031639763,36.734820322180916,39.045918367346935,37.261384808700555

Indian agriculture has been the backbone of Indian economy from time immemorial. Agriculture accounts for over 60% of the countrys total employment. About 80% population of India is engaged in agriculture or related activities.
Agriculture has contributed over three fourth of GDP and 55-60 percent to the total exports of goods and services in India. In terms of its contribution to GDP, agriculture is the second largest contributor (13.3%).
The share of agriculture in GDP has declined from 30% during the first five-year plan to 15.6% in the 11th plan period 2002-2007. There has also been a decline in agricultural production during this period. Agricultural production has fallen by 2% from the level of 1999-00 to a 10 year low level in 2012.

It is the first study of its kind to provide an overview of reform in the broader context of political, economic and social change that has occurred in both rural and urban areas. The book argues that the changes in economic policy have not been accompanied by a significant change to the overall structure of production in either the agricultural or non-agricultural sectors, and that this is a consequence of India’s political system and the institutional and cultural barriers to reform.",409,183,0.5338345864661654,6.156480783621252,0.8716514435425036,0.060431978383882576,0.8560000000000001,0.8554128440366976,0.7426418327007528,51.48976746052446,49.48872180451128,47.80867709815078

AbstractWe use cointegration approach, using data for 12 Indian regions from 1980-2010 to analyse the relationship among the variables. We find that energy and economic development has significant effect on the level of environmental pollution, while growth has insignificant effect. Energy consumption also has a negative effect and a long run relationship on environment degradation. It is further observed that per capita energy use has an important impact on energy related pollution and environment. A reduction in energy per person leads to an increased environment related problem. This suggests that it is possible to reduce environmental impact by improving energy efficiency in order to achieve sustainable growth.

Abstract
In the past decade, India’s computer industry has experienced an explosive growth as a result of globalization. This has brought with it an influx of foreign direct investment. The industry is also growing as it becomes increasingly self-sufficient in the development of its own software products, and as more and more software companies set up operations in India. However, the Indian computer services industry still faces a number of challenges, including a lack of a formal education system and skilled labour, which is a critical issue that has led to the industry’ s inability to reach its full potential.
There is an emerging need to look at the political-economy of this industry and its impact on the society as well as on other industries. In a developing economy, such as India, where the economy and society are intertwined with each other, there is little point in looking at only one aspect of it, as the",425,181,0.518324607329843,7.163388592394974,0.8748820702283122,0.05485142460789772,0.8628571428571429,0.870179640718563,0.7796113691281839,59.8220611916264,57.58638743455497,63.54826254826256

We analyze the link between employment and skills in India. We use data from 2004-05, 2011-12 Input-Output tables for India and 1987-88, and a detailed survey on skills, to estimate employment-skill link. The estimated link is consistent across skill levels and regions, with the exception of the lowest (least skilled) level. In terms of sectoral employment, we find that employment in the manufacturing sector is more skill sensitive than employment across other sectors. Further, the estimated employment–skill link suggests that skills are less important in manufacturing than in other services. Our results also indicate an increase in job opportunities in services, but these do not compensate for employment loss in.",430,192,0.5217391304347826,6.620127412408445,0.87196697617212,0.05801682190626633,0.8466666666666667,0.83970802919708,0.757715090995232,48.64169787765293,48.59627329192546,41.1167993768392

The Return of The Colonial In Indian Economic History: The Last Phase Of Colonialism In India,1949-97 by S.P Singh
In this book S Singh provides the first full length study of economic aspects of Indian decolonization. He examines the role of foreign capital and trade in India's last years of independence and assesses the impact of decolonialization on the Indian economy. The author concludes that, despite the many problems and difficulties, the economy had shown a high rate of growth in real terms from 1950 to the beginning of 1960s, with the rate falling off after that in order to reach a level close to 3% in 1993.

GST is not a perfect tax but is an improvement and it should not be discarded so easily. GST is a tax on goods and services. A negative tax is the opposite to an income tax, where the government collects less revenue by allowing for deductions and exemptions. However, in 1972, the then PM of India, Mrs Indira Gandhi introduced a uniform national tax that brought together the state taxes into one national levy. The GST will also ensure the tax collection is uniform across all States and that the same rate is applied to each commodity. It will be the world’s largest tax reform since World War 2. [6] As a matter of fact, GST can be called as an indirect tax since no physical goods are being taxed, unlike in GST. As per the new structure, a 28 percent GST would be levied on services such as telecom, banking and insurance, while the 18 percent tax would remain on the sale of goods.",433,196,0.5538461538461539,7.734040639625875,0.8879445513171129,0.04893177078062445,0.8571428571428571,0.8591812865497078,0.7767713634239337,59.96904024767802,60.40512820512821,62.67608625941959

Indian economy,shortage of skilled workers: a paradox of the indian economy,"shortage of skilled workers: a paradox of the indian economy
Shortage Of Skilled Workers
It is said that India has got a ‘skills paradox’. India’s economy depends very much of a highly skilled workforce but at the same time has a shortage of highly educated and skilled manpower. According to the latest report released by ManpowerGroup, India needs nearly 10 million skilled people. However, the government is unable to meet the demands of this skilled labour market. In fact, according to another report, nearly one million new jobs are to be created by 2022. This is a great challenge before the Indian government because there is no way to overcome this gap. So, we can say that in India, there exists a skills paradox.

(a) the significance
The tertiary industry sector has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years. It has been the principal factor in making the Indian economy, a ‘manufacturing based’ one. As per the latest estimates of Central Statistical Office, 55.8% of the gross domestic product [GDP] and the employment in the economy is accounted for by this sector. The sector is also the biggest consumer of energy in India; it accounts for 45% – 49% share of total energy consumption. Thus, the sector occupies a significant place in our economy.
Tertiary industry is that part of manufacturing sector which has an important role in creating and expanding the manufacturing base of an economy and has a strong multiplier effect. Tertiary sector includes services like transport, storage, hotels and restaurants, communication, entertainment, education, health care, and finance.

In the 1950s, Professor R.V. Mohan of Delhi University was asked to write an article on the Indian economy for the Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1962. At the time, India was still recovering from the economic effects of World War II. The country had just started its Five-Year Plans and was looking for some model to follow.
Mohan’s article was entitled “India and the Five Year Plan”. Mohn wrote that India’’ economic development was being led by Mahalanabi. This Mahalabnabi is now better known as professor Jagdish Bhagwati. Professor Jagadish’ Bhagati is currently a professor of Economics at Columbia University, New York.

About the project
This research project aims at investigating the linkage between financial inclusion in India and the growth rate of the Indian economy for the period 1995-16. Using a cointegrated VAR model, results from this study indicate that financial deepening in the economy has a significant positive impact on real GDP, which has improved over time.
The results also indicate the existence of a long term relationship between real financial depth and real output in both the short term and long run. Further results indicate financial development to have had a positive effect in reducing the volatility of Indian output and to a small extent in curbing the variability of inflation. Financial depth has also had some influence in increasing the rate at which the real per capita income increased. This study also finds evidence of financial develoment in contributing positively to the reduction of unemployment.

The main purpose of the present research is to examine the nature, structure, and performance of India’s economy. In the context of a growth model that is well established at the theoretical level in the economics literature, we examine empirically the extent of unemployment generated by sustained economic growth and whether the growth process is capable of creating sufficient employment or not. This is done using the Okun’a law which is a measure of employment elasticity of growth. The paper is organized in five sections. Section one introduces the basic concepts of national income accounting. It describes the major sectors of Indian economy, the methods of estimating national product and the national accounts.
In section two, a theoretical analysis of Okuns’ law is presented. We discuss the various interpretations of this law and its relevance to the study of economic development and policy.

The global competition in FDI has been intense in recent times. It is also possible that the FPI limit for some companies could be raised from the existing 24% to a higher level, if the company has to raise capital for R&D, manufacturing of high-tech products, or other such purposes.

This paper provides an empirical assessment of the growth-promoting effects of government expenditures and policies in India for the period 1971 to 2002 (part I of an ongoing study). The authors find that the effects are highly concentrated: while there exist several policies which have had a positive effect on growth during the past three decades, others have clearly worked in the opposite direction. A large number of policies have been tried and discarded. The main policy conclusions are that, although the government's fiscal deficit did play an important role in promoting economic activity, its impact was limited. On the other hand, a well-targeted, pro-poor expenditure program can have a very significant impact, particularly when it complements private capital flows. This finding is especially important, since there is currently a tendency in many developing countries, especially in South Asia, to advocate a ""privatization"" of social and economic policy, as a means of",448,190,0.576530612244898,8.071428571428571,0.8956584166743993,0.04551916543244451,0.897142857142857,0.8860465116279072,0.8141410964190995,72.21052631578948,72.71428571428571,79.99390838206628

A study by NASSCOM and McKinsey & Company in 2009 on “Unlocking the software

shows that $ 100 billion worth of business could be generated through export of
software in the next 10 years with minimal investments by government in

Government of India has set a target for software exports of 50 billion dollars
by 2012. Software exports have grown from 5 billion to over 20 billion in a

The history and economy of this region can be traced back to the period of pre-colonial India and the early period.
However, in recent years, with rapid developments and increasing globalization, this trade has also become more complicated. A number of new trade routes and trade agreements are being developed, which have resulted in significant changes in trade and economic patterns. One such trade agreement is the Indo-Pacific trade pact. It is a regional trade deal that seeks to integrate the economies of South Asia, Southeast Asia and Northeast Asia.

These are the main reasons why a country like China is growing so rapidly - the government can afford to invest huge amounts in its infrastructure and can borrow cheaply because it has a large number of savers. A country can only grow when it invests in physical capital. It has been observed that during the period of the 1980s, the growth of capital formation in developing countries has slowed down.

The main purpose of this research is to examine the relationship between stock markets and economic performance of Indian economy. In this paper we examine if the changes in stock index have an impact on real GDP (GDP growth). The study uses quarterly data over the period 1994-99 for 12 countries. The result is that there is a negative relationship, meaning that an increase in the stock price increases the real gross domestic product. There are two possible interpretations of these results. One is the fact that stock prices have a leading role in real economic activity. Second, there might be a lag in economic activities. These results suggest that Indian stock exchange may be used as a proxy for Indian real & Sridhar K. ""Does Stock Market Development Cause Economic Growth?

This paper presents the evidence about the nexus between the economic development, energy use and environmental pollution through nonlinear dynamic model. It is an attempt to examine the energy-income-environmental-growth nexuses through a long-run dynamic nonlinear model to assess the relationship between energy consumption and income growth, environmental growth and pollution in India. The results show that there are asymmetry in the long run relationship among energy, income, and environment in terms of the impact of income and energy on the environment and the reverse. Energy consumption has a positive impact on environmental and a negative impact: 1-15

However, the government’ s focus has always been on improving connectivity and infrastructure. This is the reason why, even in the midst of a pandemic, work has been undertaken on a large-scale and has not been hampered in any way. It is only a matter of time before the country is back on its feet once more. But the pandemic has also exposed some weaknesses, including the lack of digital infrastructure and a robust IT backbone.

AbstractThis paper analyzes the impact of government infrastructure on the location choice of manufacturing firms, the role of transport and infrastructure in the transmission of external spillovers of pollution and the relationship between the development of infrastructure and regional industrialization. We use the Census of Manufacturing Industries in India to study the determinants of location and capital structure, as well as the effects of regional differences in infrastructure quality on industrial location. The results confirm that there is a relationship of causation between infrastructure investment and industrial growth. However, there does not seem to be any direct relationship in terms of a positive impact on manufacturing employment. Furthermore, it seems to imply that the quality of roads is the most significant determinant of industrial development. Finally, we also show that infrastructure has a strong impact in reducing the level of environmental pollution generated. This implies that investment in roads may be a more efficient way of improving the environment rather than investment to improve the efficiency of production: 111",4,189,0.49238578680203043,6.910963848827236,0.8658971361674433,0.058446213896509155,0.8628571428571429,0.8554913294797675,0.7487508059612265,46.37069606159881,50.619289340101524,47.236503623188405

Abstract
This paper examines the development finance institutions (DFI) in general and infrastructure development financial intermediation specifically with emphasis on the Brazilian National Development Bank ‘BNDE’ in particular. It examines DFIs role in the infrastructure value chain from the perspective of infrastructure funding in Brazil and India.
The paper argues that DFEs can play key role as catalysts of economic growth in developing countries through infrastructure financing. This can be done by providing financial guarantees or by directly funding the construction of projects. DFAs provide financial guarantee to private and public investors for financing infrastructure projects in a country where there is lack of institutional financing or a weak credit rating system. In addition, the paper shows that infrastructure investment can create employment and increase productivity. The paper also suggests ways of promoting infrastructure in Nigeria in order for the country to benefit from such projects as is the case with China and South Korea. These countries are the most successful",6,186,0.5707070707070707,8.030560316061326,0.8939389390273413,0.04618046262136322,0.8742857142857143,0.9002298850574697,0.8148091141386851,73.2493609828496,72.38888888888889,71.92263202519379

The Indian market is poised for massive private sector investments in the coming years. The government has set up a ""National Council on Infrastructure"" which is considering the issues related to privatisation, concession, and the role of the government in infrastructure. In a series of meetings and consultations with the private and public sector, the Council is expected to come up with policy recommendations by the end of 1999.
India's infrastructure sector will undergo a radical change with an influx of private funds in coming months. However, it faces a major hurdle in that it has not yet created a legal framework in which private entities can participate in this market. A key challenge is that the Indian infrastructure industry is not ready for private participation and private investors are not clear in their mind the exact role they would like to play in an infrastructure project.

Abstract
The present work examines the importance of quality infrastructures for national and inclusive growth. It is argued that the quality of an infrastructure system can be measured by the degree of efficiency, reliability, and safety with which a system delivers services. The study finds that quality infrastructural services have an important role to play in the development of a country. In this context, the study also explores the various dimensions of infrastructual services, such as connectivity, energy, water, sanitation etc. A large-scale empirical exercise has been undertaken, wherein the data for 150 countries have been collected from the World Economic Forum.",14,193,0.5681818181818182,7.53778361444409,0.8906652047288874,0.04869034890706825,0.8228571428571428,0.8318421052631577,0.790115307360891,55.063063063063055,55.73295454545455,45.36179152512069

By Dr. S.R.S. Nair*
Rural Infrastructure Development
The concept of infrastructure was given a new lease of life in the early 2000, in response to the globalisation and market liberalisation, which is taking place in India and the world in general. Infrastructure is defined in its broadest form as “physical infrastructure” that provides the essential services for people to sustain life, including housing, sanitation, water, transportation, education and health. (World Bank 1998).
In rural areas, infrastructure is a vital component of development as it is an essential prerequisite for development activities. For example roads, power, communication and drinking water facilities are some of the infrastructure which are essential for economic development.
However, these essential infrastructure facilities need to be provided at affordable prices and at a sustainable scale to all. There are three main reasons for the failure of rural infrastructure development",17,189,0.5363128491620112,7.175376890418584,0.879893719554962,0.05331296750982329,0.8457142857142858,0.8472258064516128,0.7666991252309924,56.62864901561439,51.26815642458101,50.69514631566577

Abstract
In uncertain situations, organizations often face the difficulty of identifying and developing competencies, which will help the organization to respond to the new situation and adapt to changes. The aim of this study was to identify and analyze the competencies that the employees in the infrastructure industry in India require in order to face uncertainty. This study adopts a qualitative approach. A purposive sample consisting of 15 managers/leaders from 4 different companies in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India was taken. An in-depth interview was carried out with them.

Indian infrastructure,Syndication of VCPE investments: Evidence from the Indian infrastructure sector,"Syndication of VCPE investments: Evidence from the Indian infrastructure sector
We analyse syndication transactions in the Infrastructure Debt segment, one of the largest segments of Indian corporate debt market. The Infrastructure debt syndications are typically characterised by a large number of lenders. We show that syndicators are likely to syndicate their loans to a smaller set of banks. This is in part because the larger syndicated loans tend to be allocated to banks based on their relative performance – in terms of profitability and size. In the absence of such performance-based allocation, syndicator banks are more willing to share risk.
The analysis shows that there is a strong relationship between syndicability and the relative size of each bank. Smaller syndicating banks tend not to use the infrastructure syndicates for their larger loans, whereas the syndicing of smaller loans is more widespread. Our analysis also shows a positive link between the size and number (and hence, the number) of participating banks to the risk of synd: 101-",20,189,0.4810810810810811,6.543410136634889,0.8598334136858944,0.06182442404256616,0.8514285714285714,0.8663354037267081,0.7634393657082209,49.46132075471698,51.77297297297297,49.11543887147336

In the era of information and technology where the world is getting smarter day by day, it is a great vision to make our transport system smarter and more technologically advanced. This would not only make the journey of the people safe and easier but will also give them access to a wide array of services and facilities. It will provide them with better and faster transportation facilities to reach their desired destination.
A Smart Road is also known as smart highway is an advanced version of traditional roads. These roads use the latest advanced technology for the transportation of vehicles, which are based on the principle of communication, connectivity and control. A smart road is designed to meet the requirements of a large number of cars travelling to various locations at the same time. Some of its features include,

As the global economy is expected to contract for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, the infrastructure gap in the developing world continues to widen. The global infrastructure deficit stands at $90 trillion by 2030, according to the OECD, of which over 40% is in developing countries. While a large part of the shortfall is accounted for by a lack of funding, poor governance also plays a significant role. At the same time, infrastructure projects are increasingly seen as vehicles for development, and the importance of public-private-partnerships, especially in emerging markets, has grown substantially. In this environment of limited resources and greater expectations of infrastructure development in low-income economies, a new approach to governance is emerging.

Development and maintenance of road networks in rural parts of India are important factors for development. The road sector in the country is undergoing a major transformation, including through the National Highways Development Project (NHDP). In addition, many states in different parts are trying to develop rural roads. In the past, the focus has largely been on the construction and expansion of roads in urban parts, while the rural areas have lagged behind in this. However, this has now changed.
Rural roads are an important link between urban areas and the rest of the countryside, but they are not developed as well as the urban roads, and in many parts there is no access to a road at all. As a result, a large proportion of transport is carried out by the informal sector, for example by using bicycles, rickshaws, bullock carts and trucks, which has a great impact on transport costs, safety and pollution.",25,187,0.5,6.8190908484929285,0.8673592074321842,0.058444607203385804,0.8228571428571428,0.8417283950617287,0.7448474073826216,43.85600995179598,47.87096774193548,45.084969696969694

Abstract
Financial health of highway projects is of great importance to both the investors (financial institutions, equity investors, etc) and the public authorities responsible for these projects. The financial health assessment of the projects can be conducted by using a number of methods, some of them are: traditional debt to equity ratio, debt coverage ratio, interest coverage, return on equity, and profitability ratio etc. However, all these methods have their own shortcomings. Therefore, in this paper, a comprehensive model is developed based on the stochastic simulation technique to assess the financial risks of a highway project. An example model of an investment based highway PPP project is used to analyse the effectiveness of this model by simulating the project for a period of fifteen years. Simulation results suggest that the developed model can help to predict and understand the various parameters that affect the overall performance of financial aspects of any highway based",31,185,0.4896907216494845,6.8206025068685125,0.8644645991019357,0.059242634151779355,0.8285714285714285,0.8343529411764701,0.7688722756023693,55.18696207451829,45.7680412371134,41.17540494458653

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of information infrastructure on the performance (both output and quality) of 1,400 manufacturing firms in India. The paper finds that the presence of Internet, Intranet, and LAN/WAN at the firm-level is positively related to firms’ productivity. These findings support the argument that firms can improve their performance by making the best use of ICT infrastructure. This finding also has important policy implications for policymakers concerned with improving the use and application of infrastructure and ICT.",43,198,0.6239316239316239,6.748852387406954,0.9009455555156244,0.047894363034057474,0.88,0.8735483870967748,0.7805712394831911,59.560222517097074,61.64957264957265,67.99494485294117
Indian infrastructure,Productivity and technical efficiency in Indian states' manufacturing: the role of infrastructure,"Productivity and technical efficiency in Indian states' manufacturing: the role of infrastructure, size and location
This paper examines the technical, physical and social infrastructure and productivity levels in the manufacturing sector in 28 Indian States in three different industrial classifications: large, medium and small. A non-parametric approach of data envelopment analysis is used to derive the production frontiers and measure the productivity of manufacturing establishments. The data covers the period between 1997-98 and 2001-02. We also use panel regression analysis to examine the effect of these infrastructure indicators and size of the establishment on the level of production. Finally, we estimate the total factor productivity, its components and decompose it into its labour and physical components. Our findings show that there has been a marked improvement and convergence in all the States, as evidenced by the significant improvements in total and labour productivity. Productivity gains were also found to be higher in large and medium sized firms and in those located in urban areas.

The world is becoming more complex with each passing day. And, it is getting more competitive with every new business that enters the market. The only way forward, to stay ahead of the pack and remain relevant, is to become more “agile”.
Agility is the capacity to move quickly and nimbly, and adapt and change. It is a core capability for businesses to thrive in their respective markets, which is only possible if their supply chains remain efficient, agile and flexible. However, supply chain agility is not possible unless a firm understands and manages the flow of information and goods across its entire supply and production chain.

Description
The paper presents evidence on the impact of infrastructure on productivity of agriculture in rural areas in India. It finds that infrastructure investment in irrigation and roads is associated with a substantial increase in output for both irrigated and non-irrigated crops, whereas electricity and transport infrastructure is not strongly associated. The results also show that the effects of irrigation infrastructure are particularly strong during times of low irrigation coverage in the past, and that roads have a stronger impact on output during dry-season agriculture.",49,181,0.6194029850746269,7.170107932325289,0.9022019478548249,0.04597707278943496,0.8960000000000001,0.8600000000000004,0.8226497162562123,75.33823032759203,76.46268656716418,65.29097311139564

Abstract:
The purpose of this paper is to identify critical infrastructures, which are necessary for a country to function, and to determine their interdependencies in the Indian context. A methodology is proposed for determining the criticality of infrastructure, based on the availability of information in different sources. The paper proposes a framework to rank infrastructure based upon its critical level and importance in order to provide a basis for prioritizing infrastructure protection strategies.
Introduction:The need to secure the nation’s critical information infrastructure is now a national security imperative. Critical infrastructures are an integral and essential part of the national and global information and communication (IC) infrastructures. They are the life-support systems of our nation, without which our economy and social life can be crippled or stopped. These include power generation, telecommunications, transportation, health care, food and agriculture, law enforcement, financial institutions, etc. In the United States, critical national infrastructure was defined in 198",50,190,0.5257731958762887,7.323173217900929,0.8779607714621216,0.05334344621795545,0.84,0.8515294117647062,0.7681042535748825,50.65755329008341,50.38659793814433,47.33413528917126

AbstractA study on the linkages between urban infrastructure development, transportation infrastructure and economic growth in a developing economy like India, is presented. A theoretical model has been constructed and econometric analyses have been conducted to examine the relationship between the three variables. The study period is 1990s - 2011 for which data from the national statistical office and the Planning Commission are used. It is established that infrastructure growth – in particular transport infrastructure -- is an important driver for economic performance in the Indian economy. Infrastructure spending has a positive impact on economic output. However, the impact of infrastructure spending on GDP growth rate in urban areas is negative in contrast to the positive effects in rural areas. In order to improve the economic efficiency of urban transport investments, there is a need to increase the share of road investments. This can be achieved by reducing non-tax revenues and increasing the efficiency): 7(201",51,183,0.5347593582887701,7.312724241271306,0.8803430636386086,0.05266957697099866,0.8628571428571428,0.8611042944785273,0.7848958476219998,62.333333333333336,59.855614973262036,57.568474264705884

Indian infrastructure,"Human capital, infrastructure, and the productivity of Indian rice farmers","Human capital, infrastructure, and the productivity of Indian rice farmers: evidence from a field experiment
Abstract
We study how human capital and infrastructure investments affect the rice productivity in a developing country using a “natural experiment” in which rice growers have been provided different levels of infrastructure development. The experiment took place in rural India and was a randomized control (randomized by farm). The infrastructure provided was the installation of irrigation wells. We find that the irrigation infrastructure investment has a positive impact on productivity, which is statistically significant at a p-value of 5% with respect to the non-infrastructure group. This finding is robust to controlling for potential unobservable selection, heterogeneity, endogeneity, unmeasured confounding, reverse causality, omitted variable bias and a range of other econometric approaches. A similar finding has also been reported by the World Bank.

India has a vast coastline with about 7,500 km of beaches and 3,000 km long riverine system. This coast is extremely vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea-level rise.
As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates, coastal populations could be affected by sea level rise of at least 0.2 meters by 2040 and as high as 60.5 meters in 2100, while sea surface temperatures may rise by up to 1.1°C by the end of the century. These rising sea levels are predicted to inundate about one third of India’s landmass. In addition to sea water inundation, the coastal zone has high salinity and tidal fluctuations, which will affect the saliency and availability of groundwater, and the stability of soil and vegetation on land. As the sea rises, these effects",57,184,0.5963855421686747,7.683890204492695,0.8988910068605385,0.04554237412319962,0.8933333333333332,0.8954929577464793,0.8121213399567803,77.62435233160622,75.12650602409639,67.49272629310344

This research paper analyses the relationship between the level of infrastructure development and agricultural productivity and its impact on agricultural investment by households. A theoretical framework is constructed by incorporating the concept of investment complementarity and the role of public infrastructure investment and credit. The results indicate that the availability of better infrastructure significantly increases the agricultural production by 2.4 times. Furthermore, agricultural credit also has a positive influence on productivity. These results suggest that investment on infrastructure is an important determinant of productivity in the Indian.

The development of infrastructure is important for the economic growth of any region. Infrastructure is the backbone of development as it provides a conducive environment for investment and production. It is one the main factors in the production and distribution chain. For the growth, and economic development, investment in infrastructure and other sectors is very important. The infrastructure sector is an important sector for growth and it has to be given importance in order to achieve sustainable growth in economy.
Infrastructure in India:
Indian Economy has grown very fast in last 3-4 decades. This fast growth has created the need for more infrastructure. According to the estimates, India needs to invest US$ 1 trillion in next 15 years. There are various reasons for this huge requirement of investment. First it is because the country needs more energy and this energy will be generated through infrastructure development. Second is that the infrastructure should be able to cater to rising demand in services like transport, health, education etc. Third, it needs a large investment",60,200,0.4827586206896552,6.878251582167245,0.8629380258842233,0.0593985739796671,0.84,0.8181005586592178,0.7529586852938698,43.45948777648428,49.26600985221675,44.32102272727273
Indian infrastructure,Review of infrastructure development and its financing in India,"Review of infrastructure development and its financing in India - II
Review on infrastructure sector in the country – II :
The Indian infrastructure and development sector has grown exponentially over the years as a result of various factors. Some of the important factors are: the government’s focus on the development of this sector and making it a priority for the economic development. The other factor is the increasing need to make India a global manufacturing hub by the corporate giants, who would then invest in manufacturing sector which, in turn, would result in more demand for energy and other utilities, which in a way would help in making India more self-dependent, thereby, reducing dependency on imported products.

Abstract
The paper argues that while infrastructure has long been viewed as a key determinant of economic performance, its role in the contemporary world is more complex. The recent turn to financial markets to finance infrastructure projects has resulted in a proliferation of new financial instruments such as Public Private Partnerships, Public-Private Partnership Bonds, Social Investment Bonds and Special Purpose Entities. These new financing mechanisms and financial intermediaries such the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank have been used to attract public funds and mobilize private investment through the use of innovative financial structures. However, these new mechanisms have not been accompanied with the political reforms which would allow for the development of a public infrastructure market. This paper explores the implications of this turn, focusing specifically on three countries: India, Kenya and Colombia. It draws on case studies to explore the ways in which the financial turn has affected the politics of infrastructure and public debt. While financial",62,192,0.5621890547263682,7.97040545920216,0.8914041151072508,0.04715008283505544,0.8999999999999999,0.9050847457627099,0.8213068736215713,76.16800702922961,69.1542288557214,71.53102771645818

AbstractWe investigate the impact of physical and human infrastructure, along with other factors, on the output and productivity of manufacturing units. We find that both the physical infrastructure and the human capital are important drivers of firm performance. The findings of this study also suggest that there is some positive correlation between human and physical capital. It is observed that the efficiency of a firm is positively affected by human (managerial) capital and negatively affected: 1013-1015

Delays in project approvals and clearances, lack of land, land compensation, and other issues have been cited as reasons why some of the “game- changer” projects announced by government in the past have failed to take off.
In a letter to Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, 16 infrastructure companies, including BHEL, JSW Steel, Adani Group, Tata Power and Tata Steel have expressed concerns that delays due to land acquisition, clear environmental and forest clearance and lack in coordination among various ministries have stalled the execution of several projects worth thousands of crores of rupees. The letter was submitted by the Association of National Contractors and Consultants (NCC) to the Commerce and Industry Minister. Some of these projects have already been approved by Union Cabinet or have come to light in recent times.

The present study aims to explore the role played by public investments on infrastructure in promoting regional growth in India. To accomplish this purpose, this study uses data on regional disparities in per capita income for the period 1974-74 to 2011-12 at the state level for 25 Indian - states. Based on this data, the empirical findings of this paper demonstrate that, on the average, a 20 percent increase in public investment in infrastructure – per unit of GDP -- at state-level in one year raises the per capital incomes of states by 1.2-0.9 percentage points in the following years. This result is robust to several sensitivity tests. In fact, in a regression analysis where the level of per capita income in 1980 is used as a control variable, public capital investments are shown to increase per-capita regional income by almost four times over the long-term period. These results suggest",66,200,0.5077720207253886,7.054194357337207,0.8712212412459451,0.0563445765487987,0.8742857142857143,0.8788165680473372,0.7802234623844926,63.17957914873266,60.93782383419689,57.663559814169574

The dairy industry in India is facing a number of challenges such as lack of skilled workforce and access to technology, which is impeding dairy production.
Dairy farmers are facing difficulties in getting quality inputs and are unable to take advantage of the increasing demand for milk and dairy products. In addition, the government has been focusing on infrastructure and resource development in the dairy value chain, but this investment has not been able to benefit the small-scale dairy farmers, who constitute about 85 percent of India’s dairy farmer population. To address these issues, a new project funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was launched to assess the resource, infrastructure, and skill gaps in Indian’ s dairy supply chain and provide recommendations to enhance the productivity and efficiency of dairy in smallholder and medium-sized dairy farms, especially in rural areas. The project was recently completed with the support of experts from Australia, Japan and ADB.

Abstract
The present research paper aims at studying infrastructure as an important factor affecting Regional Development. Infrastructure is defined here as the network of physical facilities, such as transport, communication systems, energy, industrial utilities, etc., which are essential for the functioning of a country or a region. This paper examines whether infrastructure can play a vital role in the process of regional growth and development in India. The paper uses a two stage regression model, first stage estimates the growth in per capita expenditure on infrastructure (GCPINFRA) for 1996-97 and 2006 -07, second stage estimate the impact of GCPINA on growth of per capital expenditure – GCEPIN. In the second step, the study uses the Ordinary Least Squares method to analyse the effect of growth infrastructure on the per capita expenditure. It was found that there is a positive and significant relationship between the infrastructure development and growth expenditure per person in Indian states and union territories.",69,197,0.5520833333333334,7.6498910667625415,0.8870077411620069,0.049486356604007846,0.8742857142857143,0.868809523809523,0.7857978094882887,64.0,56.130208333333336,52.58888888888889

In the context of rising water stress in many countries, the role of infrastructure for water management and its financing is becoming more important. However, there are still many challenges to overcome. This paper discusses the policy dimensions for the financing and development of (urban) water infrastructures. It is shown that the two countries China, which is currently undergoing a rapid transition from state- to market-led water sector development, and the emerging economy of India, face similar challenges. The paper first reviews the existing literature in the water policy domain. Second, it discusses how water policies have evolved in China over the past decade and what policy instruments have been used. Then, India is presented as an emerging market for urban water utilities and water supply companies.

Abstract
Delhi and Mumbai, the two largest cities in the Indian sub-continent, have recently undertaken ambitious programs of building rail-based urban infrastructure. While Delhi has a legacy of urban railway development, Mumbai’s rail system is being built from scratch, and the city is in many ways a “laboratory” for Indian rail development. In this article, I use the concept of'metro' as an interpretative lens and an urban transport infrastructure as a site of contestation to examine what the railways mean for contemporary urban development in each city. The article traces the development of metro systems in these cities from their initial planning and building through to their current status. It shows how these metros are used by the cities’ residents, their changing meanings and uses, how the political uses of public transport change and shift as the systems develop, as well as how they are represented in contemporary",71,196,0.49230769230769234,6.874702790778556,0.8656075428747179,0.058685775515559466,0.8685714285714285,0.857543859649123,0.7897446944196628,53.05089486955731,54.728205128205126,54.17609511889863
Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure inequality is a characteristic of urbanization,"Infrastructure inequality is a characteristic of urbanization. The most important indicators of the degree of inequality and its impact on the development of society are the level of development and the structure of infrastructure. In this study, the authors analyze the situation with the implementation of regional policy of Ukraine for the period of 2014-2020 on infrastructure development in the country and identify a few priority areas for increasing the effectiveness of public investment in this sphere.
The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of investments in transport infrastructure and regional roads on regional development using a dynamic panel data model. We find that investments into regional transport have a significant impact, while investments from the state budget have only a weak effect. Investments into the construction of roads have the highest effect on both the growth of per capita GDP and employment. This suggests that road investments have an important multiplier effect, but this effect is smaller than the effect of railway investments.",72,193,0.4888888888888889,6.559132733999383,0.8621941108004147,0.061103874980851985,0.8114285714285714,0.8187179487179489,0.721685892542908,39.36019114621358,40.11666666666667,41.56004207060545

Abstract
Rural India faces a wide range of health issues that are not adequately addressed. A large population of rural India is affected, with a disproportionate share of burden on women and children, and the poor. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the public healthcare system in the country is inadequate and uneven. In this thesis, I use the data of the NFHS-5 (National family Health Survey) to analyze the variations and trends across states & district in public health infrastructure. The analysis includes the availability and coverage of public hospitals, public primary healthcare centres / subcentres, dispensaries, health camps, community health centres, maternity homes, child health clinics, blood banks, eye clinics [with cataract removal facility], and health personnel. These health facilities play an important role in delivering health care to the most vulnerable populations.

We study the dynamic interactions between a production system – in this case, the production systems of India’s 29 states -- and the supporting infrastructure system. Our approach is based on using the state level panel data of annual time series data from the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) for the period 1 January 1991 - 31 December 2017 of which 22 years are available for analysis. We use a set of production functions based mainly on the theory of technical change to analyse the long term trends in the productivity of these systems. For this, we use the Hodrick-Prescott filter to decompose the annual growth rate of per capita GDP into the components of aggregate productivity and its components in terms of labour and capital.

Indian infrastructure,Quality Measurements and Relevant Indian Infrastructure,"Quality Measurements and Relevant Indian Infrastructure: A Critical Appraisal
AbstractThe 1997-1998 financial year, the Ministry of Finance has initiated an effort to introduce performance measurement in the public infrastructure sectors. The paper examines the current state of performance monitoring and management of public sector infrastructure services in India, including water supply, sewerage and waste disposal, power distribution, urban transport and roads, ports and airports. Based on these, it suggests how the experience gained during the past 2 years can be utilized in formulating a more realistic and relevant approach to monitoring the quality of services. This includes the formulation of a system that will help in measuring the level of satisfaction of users, and in assessing the impact of infrastructural services on various indicators of development.): 5 (September 2006)

Indian infrastructure,Health infrastructure & immunization coverage in rural India,"Health infrastructure & immunization coverage in rural India: evidence from NFHS-4.
This paper investigates the health infrastructure and immunization service delivery in 17 states of India in the year 2015-16. We use a unique, comprehensive, and nationally representative survey (National Family Health Survey-four, NFCS-IV) to analyze the coverage of various immunization services, access to public hospitals with emergency services and the quality of public health facilities in these rural regions. In the analysis, we also control for the state of health and demographic characteristics of people to capture the heterogeneity of the region within India and to isolate the impact of these facilities from the other determinants. The key findings are that the states with low human capital and poor demographic outcomes have low coverage and quality in terms of immunization programs. Also the access, quality and cost of care in public sector hospitals is better in states which have high human development. Thus health service infrastructure is a critical determinant of coverage, accessibility and health outcomes",79,191,0.49473684210526314,6.819476751034109,0.8658803008691518,0.058856604362476014,0.8514285714285713,0.8599999999999998,0.765468730135106,57.36429514126503,53.863157894736844,51.78863310250172

AbstractIn the present paper I try to examine the impact of infrastructural facilities on labour productivity for Indian manufacturing industries. The paper uses data from the Annual Survey of Industries and the National Sample Survey Organisation for the years 1999-2001. I examine two dimensions of the productivity of an input, that is, labour and capital, and find that the infrastructurals are very important inputs for manufacturing units. A unit which has better infrastructuring has higher labour as well as capital productivity. This paper also highlights the need for infrastructuration at the level of a particular unit, in order to achieve higher productivity, by looking at different types of input use, for example, electricity, telephone, computer, etc in manufacturing plants.: 2003-04

This paper examines the status of infrastructure for urban areas in five developing economies: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Thailand. In doing so, it seeks to provide a critical overview of the state of urban infrastructure, particularly with respect to road systems. It finds that there are important differences between countries in their infrastructure performance and that a country’s performance in the infrastructure sector is not a function of its economic size. The findings are used to draw attention to key policy implications for both urban and infrastructure development.

Indian infrastructure,Role of Japanese official development assistance in enhancing infrastructure development in India,"Role of Japanese official development assistance in enhancing infrastructure development in India
Abstract: Japan’s Official Development Assistance (ODA) has played an important role in providing technical support for building infrastructure in developing countries. In the past decade, Japan has been providing a lot of assistance to developing Asia to build infrastructure. The paper examines the role of Japan in the infrastructure sector of India from the perspective of technical cooperation and capacity building. It examines whether the Japanese assistance has helped India in building a strong institutional framework for planning, financing, and operating infrastructure projects. Further, the study also examines what role Japanese aid has had in helping India to overcome the problems in implementing PPP model of infrastructure finance.

Indian infrastructure,Rural infrastructure and agricultural output linkages: A study of 256 Indian districts,"Rural infrastructure and agricultural output linkages: A study of 256 Indian districts
The objective of the paper is to estimate the impact of rural infrastructure on agricultural production. A system of equations is estimated by using the farm household survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) during 1985-86 and 1999-00. The system uses two measures of infrastructural access: physical infrastructure measured by distance to main market and secondary market, and social infrastructure as distance from a hospital or a school. It also uses agricultural and non-agricultural inputs and outputs to the agricultural sector. Results indicate a positive and significant long-run relationship between agricultural inputs, outputs and physical and especially social infrastructur, while non farm inputs are found to have a negative impact.

Indian infrastructure,Financing infrastructure,"Financing infrastructure projects in India will become easier as the government will now allow 100 percent foreign direct investment (FDI) in road construction, a senior official said.
“The Cabinet has given its nod to increase the sector’s FDI limit to 74 percent from the existing 49 percent, as announced in the Budget. It has also approved 25 percent FII investment in construction of roads, 20 percent in highways and 15 per cent in other roads,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari told reporters here. The Cabinet also agreed that the limit would be increased to the extent of any shortfall in FPI investment, he said, adding the decision will give a fillip to infrastructure development and will be a major boost to economic growth. “There has been a tremendous increase in demand for infrastructure.

Indian infrastructure,The impact of regional infrastructure investment in India,"The impact of regional infrastructure investment in India: Evidence from the power sector
This study examines the impact that regional power infrastructure investments have had on growth and other outcomes in Indian states. It focuses on the investments in grid and non-grid infrastructure, as well as on their impact on electricity consumption, agricultural growth, and poverty. The results show that infrastructure spending has a positive effect on per household electricity demand. Infrastructure investments also have a strong impact in terms of their multiplier effect, both in the electricity sector, which is the focus of the analysis, but also on agricultural productivity and rural poverty reduction. These results are consistent with the notion that electricity generation, in turn, leads to the creation of productive uses of labour and thus increases economic activity.
The study concludes that investment on energy infrastructure can improve the living standards of people in rural areas, while generating employment in urban areas. This has been achieved by a significant increase in agricultural output and a decline in poverty levels. Overall, the benefits of these investments outweigh the costs, even if one considers",85,200,0.4951923076923077,7.141765026399825,0.8683271049354254,0.05680297560406814,0.865,0.8645652173913032,0.7678993403248087,49.73687276358493,57.31730769230769,55.22851369555456
Indian infrastructure,Municipal wastewater management in India,"Municipal wastewater management in India is a challenge to both the government and industry. India’s wastewater treatment capacity stands at an abysmal 8.5 percent. In an effort to meet the rising demands of wastewater and sewage management, India has adopted several technologies.
The Government of India launched its National Wastewater Management Programme (NWMP) in 1999, aimed at treating wastewater from all sectors. The NWMP was later renamed the National Urban Waste Water Management Mission in April 2006. However, even the NWMM has not yet been completely successful in treating all wastewater. As a result, a lot of untreated wastewater ends up being released into the river systems of the country. Some of this water also ends in the sea, polluting it. This is one of several factors that has led to the increasing incidence of water-borne diseases. According to a government report, waterborne illnesses kill 2.7 million Indians every year.

AbstractThis paper examines the relationship between economic development and growth of urban poverty using a panel data for Visakhaapatriam, an industrially developed coastal city in Andhra Pradesh. The study employs the panel probit model to analyse the determinants of poverty. We have found that the urban poor in the city are not able to cope with the economic changes taking place in Visakaatami. There are some important lessons which could be drawn for the planners of the developing countries in Asia, Africa and South Pacific. It is important for planners to take the following aspects into account: (i) to ensure employment opportunities to the rural population in order to prevent migration to industrial cities, 1999 with number 1069.

Abstract
Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to identify the investment patterns of PE (private equity) and VC [venture capital] – two important players of infrastructure development, in India. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 20 PE/VC funds was randomly drawn out of which 14 were taken for analysis. The sample comprises of all funds which are operating in infrastructure. A detailed survey was conducted with fund managers and other key persons to collect data and information from them. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS 22 software. Findings: It was found that PE and venture capital investors are investing heavily in transportation and energy, water and waste sectors, but have very little exposure towards the infrastructure sectors. Research limitations/implications: Since the study covers the period 2008 and 2016, the data on investment trends might not be representative of current scenario, especially with respect to the",100,187,0.5882352941176471,8.043996665398437,0.8985629452708187,0.044649703763382356,0.8685714285714285,0.8711656441717781,0.811769664331297,77.44142843675614,72.98930481283422,73.39569475240208

The Indian government's efforts to increase educational opportunities for its poor rural population by providing infrastructure to primary schools have not always met with success. The government has been unable to provide infrastructure for all eligible schools. We show that the lack of infrastructure at schools in India has an adverse effect on enrolment, especially for girls. In particular, the likelihood of a girl attending school is negatively affected when the number of students in a school exceeds 25, while the probability of attending for boys is higher for larger classes. Our results are robust to different measures of class size and school infrastructure. Moreover, we document a positive correlation between the enrol.

Abstract
This dissertation empirically investigates the causal effects of infrastructural development on poverty in India. Using a unique panel data set of 1,000 Indian states, over the period 1993 to 2010, I investigate the effect of various types of infrastructure and their combination with the level of poverty on household consumption and expenditure. I find that infrastructurally developed states have lower poverty rates than the infrastructually underdeveloped states. This suggests that poverty can be reduced by developing infrastructure. Infrastructure, particularly roads, has a significant positive effect on income generation and hence has an impact on the poverty level. The results also indicate that the impact of road infrastructure is stronger than that of irrigation infrastructure in reducing poverty. However, the results show that irrigation and power infrastructures do not have any significant impact. In addition, while there are significant gender differences in the effects,",104,194,0.5260416666666666,7.289047148519026,0.8778173237005129,0.053511413546105786,0.8685714285714285,0.86,0.781177912304403,55.553847010975545,59.135416666666664,56.844166666666666

Abstract
India’s cities, the largest cities being in the metropolitan regions, are home to nearly 30% of its population. The recent rapid growth of urban infrastructure has been instrumental for the economic progress of these regions. In this paper, we empirically assess the impact of infrastructure spending on population density for 27 major cities of the country. A panel data approach was adopted for this study and the results reveal significant positive association between the level of spending and density of population in cities. We also find a positive relationship between density and other parameters like population, per capita income, literacy, and health expenditure. However, there exists an insignificant association at the national level. This study contributes to the understanding of spatial structure of Indian urban areas and provides policy implications for further infrastructure growth in order to promote sustainable development.

Abstract
This study is based on the PPP model in India, and particularly on how this model has been applied in the Bangalore region. The main reason why PPP has become a popular method for infrastructure financing, is its flexibility and its ability to be customised and adjusted to the needs of each infrastructure sector. PPP is not a financing option in itself. It is rather the use of different financial instruments to provide a long-term loan in order to finance large infrastructure projects. In this case, public and private investors collaborate in a partnership to build, own, operate and maintain (BOO) infrastructure assets. This thesis is focusing on Green Field Bangalore Airport PPP Project – a PPP project, which was awarded to Bangalore international Airport Company Limited (“BIAC”) in 2008, by the Government of India.",109,183,0.5572916666666666,7.722059850411245,0.8887937133189766,0.04870416801911237,0.8742857142857143,0.8626190476190471,0.8005348650432196,61.78393351800554,58.104166666666664,50.66152597402598

Abstract
Infrastructure projects are being considered as one of the key drivers of Indian development and the private sector has been given a major role in infrastructure development in the country by means of Public Private Partnerships (PPP). However, the recent experience from India shows that PPP projects have been fraught with several issues and problems and in most cases the projects were not delivered on time, within budget and to specification. The present paper is an attempt to critically analyse some of these issues, and identify the reasons for them. In addition, it seeks to analyse the current legislative/legislative framework available in respect of BOD based infrastructure PPP in order to identify some gaps in this legal/institutional framework which are likely to cause problems during implementation of infrastructure project and also to suggest some measures/remedies to overcome those problems.

Indian infrastructure,Disasters and exemplified vulnerabilities in a cramped Public Health Infrastructure in India,"Disasters and exemplified vulnerabilities in a cramped Public Health Infrastructure in India
In India, public healthcare delivery has largely remained a government monopoly with private hospitals and clinics remaining a minority. In the last two decades, there has been an increase in private investment in healthcare services in the country. The private healthcare sector accounts for nearly 70% of India’s total public-private healthcare expenditure. However, in rural India where nearly two-thirds of the population resides, the private sector has failed to reach even the most rudimentary services and facilities. 1, 2.
As the public health sector is not meeting the health needs of a significant population of Indians, private providers are playing a vital role by providing services to the urban population. But they fail miserably in providing even basic services. A recent study has shown that 90 – 98% private doctors in Mumbai do not prescribe essential drugs. They fail to provide basic facilities like clean drinking water,",119,180,0.5409836065573771,7.318290582450271,0.8820677731580617,0.05212586799212966,0.8857142857142858,0.8694339622641508,0.7932404243141401,51.17963855918232,61.39344262295082,51.187937234390326

Abstract
Infrastructure planning has become an urgent task for the Indian cities. The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the current status of drinking water provision to households, and its implications for urban development and to explore possible policy options to improve it. To this end, the paper develops a mathematical framework to estimate the optimal capacity of a water distribution network for each city based on household densities, household size, water use, access to piped network and other factors. A simulation exercise with two scenarios shows that a network of 10 km radius with a pumping capacity to cover the entire city can be sufficient to meet the drinking needs of the city, if the household sizes of all cities can shrink from the average of their current sizes to 2.5",126,185,0.5913978494623656,8.065591326174431,0.899484927089366,0.04428927059734041,0.8285714285714285,0.8419753086419753,0.8015291217108171,59.97120418848168,60.04838709677419,52.16434652554072

Abstract
Infrastructure is the backbone of the Indian economy as it provides a wide platform for growth of various economic sectors. There is a strong consensus that the infrastructure development in the country has been lagging behind in comparison to the global scenario. It is observed that there has not been much investment in infrastructure, in spite of high growth rate witnessed in recent years. In this context a detailed analysis of Indian infrastructure sector has become necessary. This paper is an attempt to study the political factors behind India’s infrastructural development. The analysis reveals that political factor is one of major factors influencing the growth in infrastructurals in Indian scenario; however, the extent of political influence varies with infrastructure type and its sub-type. Infrastructure sector is found more sensitive to political changes in power and political parties have been using infrastructure for gaining political mileage.

Abstract
The present study was undertaken to identify and explore the gaps in health infrastructure in our country – “India”. The study revealed that there is a wide variation in the availability of various facilities among different states in India. The availability in various states are: Primary health centre (PHC) is available in all states, 50% of the total states have sub-centre available, and 33% states has a dispensary available. Among tertiary health care facilities, hospitals are available at a rate of 80% in some states. In terms of doctors, the study shows a significant gap between the number needed and doctors available for a state. For all the states combined it shows that the required doctors are 8.7 times as much as that currently available - 1.3 lakhs in 2011 as compared to 16,100 in actual available number of physicians [2010-11].

The public expenditure of India is divided into four categories: Revenue expenditure, Capital expenditure and Transfers and subsidies, Interest expenditure including debt amortization, and Contingency. It accounts for nearly 70 percent of the GDP. The government spends a major part of its revenues on Interest payment and Debt servicing. This is because of a very large public debt, which is about 60 percent - 65 percent. Of the 5 percent, 3.6 percent is the share of Debt service.
Interest Payment and debt servicing have grown by 4 percent and 8 percent respectively every year. Debt and Interest payments constitute an average of 15 percent share in the total budgetary allocation of all Ministries. 20 percent budget is earmarked for Interest Payment. In 1993, Debt Service and interest payments together accounted for less than 2 percent expenditure. As the economy has grown and the government has increased the amount spent on interest payment",129,192,0.5243243243243243,7.131581834309935,0.8763216784048902,0.054551810101402566,0.8342857142857143,0.8479503105590063,0.7657102255809294,52.69237478730885,54.94054054054054,44.327463445645265

The public-private partnership (PPP) model, a form of contractual arrangement for the delivery of infrastructure services through the private sector is increasingly used to finance infrastructure in developing countries. Despite its popularity, there is limited empirical evidence on the performance of PPPs in terms of their ability to deliver high-quality infrastructure and services and achieve development goals. A review of existing studies indicates that the PPP model has not always delivered the promised outcomes of highquality infrastructures, reduced costs, enhanced efficiency, and increased service availability. This study aims to identify the factors that may be constraining the ability of the public and private sectors to achieve these objectives through PPP in the context of India. The study examines the nature and causes of disputes in PPP agreements, their impact on PPP outcomes, the role of dispute settlement procedures in reducing the impact of these disputes and its effect on outcomes. Finally, this study identifies the main factors constrapping disputes resolution mechanisms in Indian public infrastructure projects",131,192,0.49746192893401014,6.982210898815145,0.8678384771972052,0.05760011687942235,0.8685714285714285,0.8721387283236991,0.771683708753173,64.22913018096907,61.3502538071066,59.61217008797654

The Government's push towards infrastructure development is well known by now. The focus has been not only on infrastructure sectors such as highways, railways, ports and urban development, but also on sectors like airports, power, telecom and oil & gas. In 2007-08, the overall outlay on the physical infrastructure was Rs 3.2 lakh crore, with public sector share amounting to 50 per cent.
Given the critical nature of infrastructure, its development has also been given top priority by several countries in the world. As a result, in a relatively long period, countries have made significant progress in this regard. There are many factors to these achievements, including a large public expenditure, high levels of investment from both public and private sectors and the availability of adequate technical manpower. However, a common feature of all infrastructure-led development models is the need to have a supportive framework, and a policy and administrative system that",132,194,0.5927835051546392,8.256518824103988,0.9007327048469622,0.04338981558339204,0.8971428571428571,0.8856470588235281,0.8060488567823548,73.86096783980582,74.65979381443299,76.7290932502033

The second five-year plan of the Indian government (1992-97) called for “massive” infrastructure development, including construction of 100 new airports and 10,000 more kilometres of highways, and the laying of new pipelines for transporting petroleum products and natural gases.
Despite the government’s lofty plans, the country’ s infrastructure is in poor condition, particularly with respect to power, roads and irrigation. The World Bank has warned that India’slarge infrastructure deficit is a threat to the economic and social development ofthe country. In its most recent review of India in December 1998, it said, “…the current infrastructure investment level is not sufficient to sustain growth at even the relatively low levels that have been achieved in recent years.” It added that there was ""a need for substantial investment in the energy, telecommunications, transport",135,188,0.5932203389830508,7.892283294029704,0.8991162525438291,0.04487764555111658,0.8914285714285713,0.8886274509803916,0.8143043060054744,68.56191170427194,73.92090395480226,76.34960952308742

AbstractThe World Banks and the Asias Development Banks (ADB) 2005 Asian Urban Development Report [ADR] argues that the Asian urban crisis is rooted in the poor governance of urban services. It is the governments failure to invest in urban service provision that is at the heart of the problem - governments in Asia are not investing the necessary amounts in infrastructure, especially in cities. As such, it advocates increased investments in city infrastructure to support rapid and sustainable urban growth. This chapter explores how these institutions shape the urban agenda and support the reengineering of infrastructure and services in Asian cities through investments and policy.

Abstract
Smart city mission is an ambitious plan to transform Indian cities by using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and other digital technologies to improve city services. As of 2015, more than 40 Indian urban cities had been selected as smart city, and the list includes several Indian IT hubs. This paper presents an overview of some of the smart initiatives undertaken at different levels of city governance. We present an empirical analysis of a few selected smart projects in two smart Indian city-states: Kochi in Kerala and Bangalore in Karnataka. The analysis reveals that while the state government in both the cities is driving the process with its top down approaches, the city administration has become the primary implementer.",140,192,0.6162790697674418,8.082424227628048,0.905962913630742,0.04206481313147294,0.8666666666666667,0.8521621621621622,0.8189805053786452,76.13761467889908,69.51162790697674,56.64916344916345

Abstract
The paper explores the distribution and accessibility of infrastructural and service-based amenities across the urban districts of India using a unique database of 2,200 urban local self governments. We find that the share of urban areas served by the government with the basic and infrastructure services increases with an increasing urban size. The urban population living more than one kilometer away from public transport, public health, education, and water supply facilities is significantly higher in the larger cities. Further, we find an increase, rather than decrease, in inequality in service delivery across districts. Our results provide empirical support for the argument that local governments should be allowed to expand and provide more services to the population of their jurisdiction in a more decentralized and devolved environment, thereby reducing inequality.",143,195,0.5548780487804879,7.105906165931576,0.8845054219275618,0.05214569784422606,0.8466666666666667,0.8505714285714278,0.7942596552299949,57.54385964912281,58.853658536585364,53.14596332009832

Abstract
In spite of the fact that the development and growth of a region depend on various factors such as geographical location, natural resources, availability of human resources and infrastructure, the region with better infrastructure tends to attract more investments leading to rapid economic and industrial growth. Hence, it has been observed that there is a positive and significant correlation between infrastructure development in a country and economic development, with the former being the driving force behind economic progress. The present study aims at identifying and explaining the impact of infrastructure on poverty, in Indian states. It uses a time series data for the period 2000–2014, collected from the official statistics of government sources and other reliable secondary sources. We employ both ordinary and structural causality tests to test the hypothesised relationship. Our results indicate that economic infrastructure has a significant impact on regional poverty in India, while the causation from poverty to infrastructure is also significant",146,185,0.5538461538461539,7.734040639625875,0.8879445513171129,0.04893177078062445,0.8857142857142858,0.8757894736842105,0.795348410754306,65.0,64.37948717948719,64.83052412837682

AbstractThe study assesses and compares the physical and financial infrastructure of government versus non-government aided primary (1- 7) and upper primary( 8-12) schools under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan - a central government school education reform programme initiated in 2000. A sample of 1,000 schools is covered from five states. Data is collected by means of a specially designed school questionnaire and by using an asset index for each school. This paper assess the impact of public school expansion on access to education for poor children in the five selected States. The study finds that private aided schools have much better physical facilities, including more teachers and more textbooks. They also charge higher tuition fees and the quality of education appears to be higher. It is also found that the cost structure of private schools makes them vulnerable to fluctuations in their financial inflows. Finally, it is argued here that, despite the higher quality and lower costs of the private sector",148,198,0.5482233502538071,7.694681398694242,0.886229543194741,0.04958471626561498,0.8914285714285715,0.8781502890173408,0.8169518178765889,63.175518462316646,62.16243654822335,67.15102836111711

We investigate the effect of the implementation of biometric identity smart cards on labor market participation, welfare, and program performance. We find that participation in the public employment guarantee and rural health insurance schemes increases after the introduction of smartcard technology. Labor market participants also receive benefits from increased labor force participation: the smart card is associated with higher wages and longer working hours. The impact on welfare is ambiguous. Our results also confirm that smartcarts help program participants to avoid the leakages that characterize public schemes. These results suggest that the Indian government can improve the effectiveness of existing programs by replacing the existing payment infrastructure with the new smart)

Indian infrastructure,The impact of infrastructure provisioning on inequality: Evidence from India,"The impact of infrastructure provisioning on inequality: Evidence from India
This study investigates how the impact on income inequality of public provision of basic infrastructure (schools, roads, and irrigation) may vary across states in India and between rich and poor households. Using a panel data set, the study analyses the effect of these public interventions on the distribution of income among rural households in a sample of Indian states and among households of different wealth groups over the period 1973–2000. The results show that, although the overall distribution has become more unequal, provision and investment in basic public infrastructure have reduced inequality among rich households, but not among poor ones. Public infrastructure investments have been more beneficial to poor people in states with high levels of per capita income in the pre-reforms era. In contrast, there is no impact at all on poor families in high-performing states.

The paper analyses the Aadhar mega infrastructure project that the Government of India launched in 2008, in order to develop a national database of citizens that could be used for a range of purposes from providing identity documents to accessing social assistance programmes. The paper looks at the technical specifications of the project, the governance structure of its creation, and finally the ways in which the Indian government used these technological infrastructures and their social implications. It examines the implications for the everyday lives of people who have been involved in the construction of this infrastructure and its uses. In doing so, it highlights the extent to which this mega-project can be seen as an extension of a broader eGovernance agenda that has been promoted by the government since 1999.

Indian infrastructure,Sustaining India's irrigation infrastructure,"Sustaining India's irrigation infrastructure
The government needs to invest more in irrigation and improve the efficiency of its use.
In India, the use of irrigation has increased from 60% in 1980 to 80-90% currently. This is due to better technology (e.g. water pumps, drip irrigation, etc) as well as government interventions – irrigation subsidies and free electricity to farmers. As farmers continue to migrate to cities and the country’s population grows, this increase is bound to continue. The government’ water resources department estimates India’ irrigation potential at a whopping 600,000 km and its irrigation area at 160 million hectares [1]. India also has the largest irrigation canal system in the world. 70% of this is in arid and semi-arid regions of India. India needs a “new green revolution” to meet its food requirement and to maintain the water table.

AbstractThe paper attempts to estimate the long-run relationship between public investment and GDP using panel data for India. Using annual data from 1971 to 2008, the analysis indicates that the impact of the investment in infrastructure is not very different from investment spending in other sectors. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that a 1 percent increase in the ratio between the capital and the GDP is associated with a decline in real GDP of 0.7 percent. However, it may also be argued that an increase of capital spending of one unit increases GDP by about two units for every unit spent as an input in capital-intensive manufacturing industries. These results suggest the existence of a negative capital income): 9 (2009)

Abstract
Background: Slums of India are the most unplanned areas of the country. It is difficult in such areas to get immunization for children under the universal immunization programme. A study of immunizing facilities and immunization status of children of slum dwellers of Kolkata has been undertaken to determine the availability and accessibility of such facilities. Materials and methods: The study population included 3000 mothers (50% males and 50 % females) of age 0-5 years from 12 slams of 6 wards of North, South and Central Kolkata. All the mothers of these children were interviewed to collect data. Immunization status was also ascertained through the immunisation cards of all the children. Results: Out of a total population of approximately one lakh slummers, only 25% of them had access to health facilities available under universal immunizations programme, 10-25 %. The immunization coverage was low.

This study investigates the relationship between transport investment and economic performance using a new data set on the investment, performance, and geography of rail and roads in the British Raj. The data are based on annual reports of railway companies, government surveys, official censuses, local gazetteers, land ownership registers, censorial records, court documents, railway timetables, passenger and freight tariffs and receipts, maps, correspondence, photographs, newspaper advertisements, architectural drawings, engineering drawings and reports, etc. Using panel data regressions of 1870-1945 and spatial econometrics for 1910, this paper finds strong positive associations between investment in transport infrastructure and GDP per capita growth across regions of all scales. This relationship is strongest in areas where the population was least mobile, where transport costs, especially in terms of time, were highest. It is not clear whether or not these associations are spurious.

Abstract
In the recent years, the health sector has been witnessing a significant growth, especially in the public health services. In India, health infrastructure in general is inadequate and needs an improvement. A large number of people in rural and urban areas lack proper health facilities. This article is an effort to analyze the status of health infrastructural facilities and their impact on the economic growth of the country. Maharashtra, considered to be as one of “BIMARU” states, has emerged as a leading industrial state in terms of growth and development of its economy. The study examines the link between health infrastructures and the state’s economic developments.

A major challenge for governments of developing countries is to expand the capacity and quality of their cities' infrastructure. This requires large capital investments in transport and other infrastructure services.
In India, the need for urban development has intensified in recent years, in particular in large metropolitan areas, as the rapid growth of its economy has resulted in rising demand for housing, transportation infrastructure, water supply and sanitation, and basic social services.

Abstract
A bicycle-sharing is a system which facilitates the short-term usage of bicycles by multiple people and is an emerging mode of transport. The PBSS are a combination of bicycle, docking station and a management system for a bike-rental service. There are different types of docking stations, which include fixed docking, free floating, and smart docking systems. PBRS can play a crucial role in improving air quality, reducing traffic congestion, providing a viable alternative to private automobile ownership, encouraging exercise, supporting local and national tourism and improving the quality of life in cities by providing an additional transportation option. This paper discusses the existing infrastructure of PBST in the global cities. Then the PB systems are analyzed based on the parameters of cost, efficiency. And finally, the conclusion is drawn that the current PB infrastructure is very less in India when compared to the other countries.

Transport is a key enabler of economic development. It plays an instrumental role in the overall development of economy through efficient mobility of both goods and services. In this regard, the role of transport infrastructure is of paramount importance in any developing nation. The present study investigates the long-run relationship among the transport, industrial and energy variables. Using cointegration approach, a three-variable system is tested. Co-integration, vector error correction model and Granger causation test have been employed in order to investigate the causal relationship between the variables in short-term and long term. We find strong causal linkage between energy, transport and industrial variables for India. Moreover, we found a unidirectional causatory relationship from energy to industrial output and from industrial to transport output. This finding supports the hypothesis of Koop et al.

It is found that the growth in all infrastructure measures has been positive during the entire period considered. The average growth rate in 1998/99 to 2004/05 was 2.1 per cent. There has not been a consistent pattern among the regions of the country. All the measures are significantly related to the human development indicators such as literacy and infant mortality rates, and there are significant differences in the levels of human resources development for different regions.

AbstractThe Indian economy is witnessing a rapid transformation. The transformation of the industrial sector from a labor-intensive one to a capital and technology intensive sector is underway. With this shift, the role of ICT has become important for the growth of industrial efficiency and productivity, and in reducing inefficiencies that arise from the fragmentation of physical infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a two-sector model and examine the effect of infrastructure and ICT on productivity in both the services and manufacturing sectors. Using the data of manufacturing and services sectors for years 1998-2000, for a panel of 30 industrial clusters and a control group of non-industrial clusters, our results show that the productivity growth in manufacturing is positively associated with the development of road and power infrastructure in the manufacturing clusters whereas, in case of services sector, both infrastructure development and use of technology increases the level of productivity. We find that ICT infrastructure",170,183,0.453125,6.278684177437181,0.8494364336324869,0.0659411752049039,0.8285714285714285,0.8300000000000005,0.7297367170401157,44.98963553176258,41.942708333333336,40.52269008869371

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure and economic development: some empirical evidence,"Infrastructure and economic development: some empirical evidence from the EU countries
This paper provides an empirical assessment of the impact of investment in infrastructure on economic growth in the countries of Europe. The study is based on the theoretical arguments on which the European Union’s Structural Funds are based. It uses a set of econometric models to test the effect of capital accumulation on GDP growth. Empirical evidence for this purpose is extracted from 18 European countries for the period 1970-1997, with the aim of investigating the relationship between growth and investment. An empirical investigation of this relationship is carried out by means of a system of panel cointegration and vector error correlation models with structural breaks. This is a challenging task because the empirical literature on structural change has been largely neglected. Results reveal the existence of an inverse relationship in all countries studied between total infrastructure capital stock and GDP. These empirical results are robust, even after controlling for various macro-economic variables, and can be explained by a combination of two mechanisms: direct and indirect ones.

Solid Waste Management
The Indian government does not have a comprehensive policy for solid and hazardous waste. It does have several programs in place to help improve its situation, such as the Integrated Solid Waste Treatment Project (ISWTP). This program focuses on improving waste collection, recycling, composting, and the management of landfills. India is also working to improve waste education. For example, in 2008, India opened India' s first waste-to-energy plant in the city of Hyderabad.[1]
Infrastructure
There are a large number of informal waste workers, including garbage pickers, ragpickers and rummagers.[2] There are also several waste processing and treatment facilities in various states across India.[3",173,198,0.5376344086021505,7.332355751067665,0.8812463507183071,0.052325610031986755,0.8342857142857143,0.851111111111111,0.7872878232483401,48.401635202792704,55.193548387096776,54.88891352549889

The study examines the extent to which access has been improved through microcredit in selected districts. The study focuses on the provision of access by private companies and households to the water sector. It examines whether the poor have been helped and whether access is sustainable. Access to safe water has increased in all districts except two. Water quality has improved and the number of users has grown in most cases. Private companies have played an important role in providing access for some groups, especially the urban poor. However, in other places, the state, NGOs and community organizations have provided a larger proportion of the infrastructure. This shows that there has not been a clear shift towards the private sector in the sector as a whole. Households have benefited from microcredits in terms of increased access, improved sanitation levels and improved quality of water. There are a number factors that explain why the results of micro credits do not translate into access.",174,188,0.4897959183673469,6.857142857142857,0.8647686695258835,0.05899486194580842,0.8457142857142858,0.8602325581395346,0.7587013399571313,49.847239774950616,54.076530612244895,50.70062359435698

Abstract. This paper examines district-wise variations, and district specific factors, in terms of childhood vaccine coverage and immunization rates. The paper focuses on district level data covering 2001 and 2011. We use a probit model to study the effects of district and community level characteristics on the coverage of vaccines. A set of explanatory factors such as community and individual socio economic status (SES), health care availability, health awareness, literacy, caste, distance, sex of child, number of years since last birth are incorporated into the model.
This study is unique in two ways. First, it provides detailed district – level estimates of immunization coverage rates by combining survey data at a disaggregate level.

Abstract
Infrastructure provision is one of the most important determinants of poverty reduction. This study investigates the impact on rural-urban inequality of two different types of infrastructures in rural India during the last two decades. Our main focus is on electricity, irrigation, roads and transport. In rural areas, we find a positive and significant relationship between the number of electrification projects and inequality. A negative and insignificant link with the rural–urban distribution of irrigation projects was found. On the contrary, road and rail projects were negatively related to inequality at the village level. The main explanation for this is that roads are more likely to benefit the better-connected rural households in more developed states, whereas railways benefit all rural residents, including those who live in less developed areas.",178,181,0.5502958579881657,7.153846153846154,0.8835651043104904,0.05226248509333423,0.86,0.8560000000000005,0.7872120011823069,60.207514383905476,61.32544378698225,55.754924147179615

Abstract
In a country like India with huge diversity of language, culture, and religion, it is essential to develop an integrated digital infrastructure to bring out the best in a nation. In this paper, we explore the role of digital communication infrastructure in promoting the development of the nation as a whole, which in our case is India. Our focus is not on the infrastructure that the government must develop, but on how the private sector and the community can work together to build the digital nation that India wants.

Abstract
Background: In India, cancer is the second most common cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for 6.0% of the global disease burden. Medical oncology plays a major role in the management of cancer patients.
Methods: Data were collected from the Medical Oncology clinics of three different hospitals in South India. Patient data were extracted from electronic medical records. These data included the type of malignancy, age, treatment type, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, clinical staging and response to therapy. The patients’ treatment outcomes were also recorded. Data on the availability of chemotherapy drugs, supportive care facilities and the treatment infrastructure was collected through a structured questionnaire. We assessed the quality and efficiency of clinical services and identified areas of need and gaps in service provision by the medical oncology clinics in these hospitals.

Abstract
In this paper, we investigate the profitability determinants in infrastructure Public Private Partnerships (‘PPP’) projects in India. We use data from a survey covering 120 such projects. Based on the survey data and using a two-step least squares technique, the paper identifies and tests the determinants which are most likely to explain the variation in the return on investment. The paper finds that profitability of projects is negatively related to the share of debt in project capitalisation. Further, projects with higher capital investment have higher profitability than those with lower capital investments. This suggests that a project’s capital intensity determines its profitability. It is also found that the project profitability is higher when the projects are implemented with the participation of the State government or when it is a ‘build and transfer’ project as in comparison with 'build, own and operate’ projects or PPPs involving only a long term lease. Moreover, project size and project duration have significant negative relationship with profitability as they are the drivers",184,199,0.5048076923076923,7.2804400754561325,0.871930144696589,0.05524864371553868,0.8349999999999999,0.8260869565217399,0.7856080357579959,46.13678618857902,48.18269230769231,41.15597147950089

This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of different bicycle friendliness features of the Indian bicycle infrastructure - on the bicyclist's choice to use the bicycle instead of other transport modes, on their level of bicycletrism and on health status, among the population in 2 cities of North India
The study shows that bicycle facilities are effective in increasing the number of people who use a bicycle to reach their destination and that such facilities also lead to a significant increase in the level and extent of cycling.
It also suggests that there is an association between bicycle-related health outcomes like the rate of cardiovascular diseases, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and type II diabetes. The study also shows an increase of 7-9% in health of non-obese adults and a 12% increase with obese",185,183,0.5480225988700564,7.29096647162744,0.8838057658406683,0.05168844127198378,0.8799999999999999,0.8747712418300648,0.7980520435841902,57.26358295691011,61.75141242937853,55.21848739495799

Indian infrastructure,Towards a comprehensive understanding of public private partnerships for infrastructure development,"Towards a comprehensive understanding of public private partnerships for infrastructure development in Sub-Saharan Africa
Public Private Partnership (P3s) are widely recognized as a key mechanism for financing and delivering infrastructure projects in low- and middle income countries. However, they have not had the desired effect in Africa. To date, only a small number of P3 projects have been successful. This is despite several countries, such as Ethiopia and Ghana, developing a robust legal and administrative framework to facilitate P2s. Despite this progress, many governments in sub-Sahara Africa are still reluctant to develop their own PPs.
This paper aims to provide a holistic view of PPPs by looking at PPS in the subSaharan region, from conception to implementation, with the aim of identifying the barriers to successful implementation. It provides a conceptual overview of the PPP framework, the role of private investors and financing institutions, and outlines the main legal, contractual, financial, operational, political and regulatory issues.

The Indian government has initiated the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model to address its infrastructure development needs. This paper analyses how governance mechanisms have been used to structure PPPs to facilitate their success and the relationship between the institutional and structural mechanisms and project performance. It examines the PPP arrangements in 13 large-scale road projects across India from 2000 to 2010. The study found that there was no direct relationship with the governance arrangements and their influence on project success; rather, the success of PPP projects depended on the quality of the contracts, project design, and government commitment and oversight. In addition, it found a relationship that is not expected with governance structure and contract structure, namely, that PPP infrastructure contracts are generally more complex and more expensive than non-PPPs. As such, government intervention and control over PPP contracts and projects are required and are the key to success in PPP): 4 ()

Cholesterol is responsible for production and secretion of toxins that enter small intestine causing profuse watery diarrhoea, vomiting, and dehydration. There are many oral vaccines available for choleras but are not widely available.
Objective: To conduct an intervention study to evaluate the safety of a newly licensed, affordable oral Vaxchora® choleri vaccine with oral rehydration therapy, in the Indian context, among the population at risk. The study also assessed the acceptability and impact of the intervention. This research was conducted in a rural area in Bhubaneswar District of Odish, the capital of Orissa, a state in eastern",191,196,0.6329787234042553,8.678966994124726,0.9126661819295196,0.03840270722577898,0.8742857142857143,0.8631707317073173,0.8248238620571885,71.27272727272728,70.87234042553192,69.85527759490893

COVID -19 : “The disease and its consequences have exposed many gaps in the public healthcare system”
India has been one of the first few countries to be hit by COVID- 2019. It is also the third worst-hit country behind USA and Brazil. The number of people infected by the coronavirus in India is the highest in Asia after China and Japan. India’s response to the COVID outbreak has come under criticism for lack of preparation and infrastructure, as the country’ s healthcare is already under-funded and lacks the ability to deal with an epidemic.
In India most of our hospitals are run by private trusts and not by government or non-profit organizations. As a general rule, the private hospitals tend to provide higher-quality service than the government ones. But in a country like India which is grappling with poverty, inequality and the lack or poor quality of health services,",192,184,0.5531914893617021,7.5849795578905175,0.886936383924207,0.04971669671584159,0.937142857142857,0.9039024390243898,0.8053207368700391,73.26264822023377,70.34042553191489,64.77319902319903

AbstractThis paper provides a new measure of infrastructure development for the rural economy and examines its impact on the level and volatility of rural real GDP. We find that rural infrastructure investments are a significant source of aggregate real output growth and are more responsive than urban public infrastructure to the demand for goods and services that are typically consumed by rural households. Further, rural public investments have a stronger impact in stimulating rural income growth in comparison to public urban investments. Our results also show that investment in public rural physical infrastructure leads to a decrease in rural unemployment and the volatility and uncertainty of real rural incomes is lower with rural investment: 2

Abstract
This paper examines perceptions of local communities about development projects in the vicinity of Arunta (Tibet), the headquarters of Changsa in Tawang District, Arunchal state. It also investigates if these perceptions differ depending on whether communities are members of the dominant Aruna tribe, the indigenous Gaddi tribe or the Bodo tribe. We argue that the nature of perceptions differs for communities that are differentially located on the same land. Using 24 in-depth interviews of people from all three communities, as well as 11 focus group discussions, we found that communities differed in their attitudes depending whether or not members were from the Arna tribe; Arunas are more likely to be supportive of infrastructure. This is because the project has direct benefits for the community. In contrast, Gadis and Bodos are less supportive and more opposed to the development. However, Bodes are also likely beneficiaries of this infrastructure as a",198,190,0.5440414507772021,7.558065382861293,0.8843310518200896,0.050608640493957066,0.8914285714285713,0.8828402366863901,0.7945221388026065,70.22224549643904,62.23834196891192,60.405087719298244

AbstractThis paper investigates the effect of pay, promotions and transfers on motivation to work in irrigation departments in the two countries. For this purpose, a comparative approach is adopted in which data from the South Asia and East Asia Survey of Public Service Motivation (2007–08), which includes a survey of 1,700 civil servants in Korea and India, are used. The findings show that the level of public service motivation varies between the agencies. In contrast to the public sector, the motivation of Indian irrigation staff appears to depend much more on their own initiative, and is therefore less affected by the motivational level in their department, which in turn is affected negatively by promotions. Korean irrigation department staff are more likely to be motivated by their pay and to have been transferred to another agency than Indian staff in a similar category. This suggests that in Korean public organisations, there is less of a tendency to promote staff within their agency, whereas in Indian organisations the",199,191,0.49748743718592964,7.017923929582525,0.8681003649499361,0.057376278807718124,0.8742857142857143,0.8751999999999989,0.773527339010567,53.65319721518057,61.06030150753769,56.424019607843135

This paper aims to re-examine the nexus between growth in gross domestic product and infrastructure investment by revisiting the methodology of estimation used in the seminal studies of Soligo et al. (2000), and Chari et. al 2014. The study uses a two-step methodology which includes first estimating the growth function using the Hodrick-Prescott – filter and second estimating a vector error corrected model using a co-integration technique. We also include additional infrastructure measures in addition to the traditional ones of road density and road per 1000 km of roads. In order to test the robustness of the results, we also employ alternative growth functions - the ARDL approach and the Granger causality approach.

Abstract
In India, the urban sector suffers from several challenges, including low tax collection, poor governance and low service delivery. In spite of the importance of municipal reforms for the improvement of urban service provision, it remains a neglected area of research. I address this gap through a study of ‘Municipal Financial Accountability Act’, 1970, one of India’s most important laws for urban financing. The study examines how the provisions of this law are implemented at different levels of government, particularly the financial accountability provisions. Using field research, I explore the role of elected local government officials in implementing the law at the local level and assess the impact of these provisions on the delivery of service at both the state and local governance levels. Based on this research I argue that while the legal provisions for municipal financial reporting and accountability are important for ensuring fiscal transparency and",204,190,0.5077720207253886,7.054194357337207,0.8712212412459451,0.0563445765487987,0.8571428571428571,0.8404733727810654,0.7799763153966212,48.793609168609166,50.6839378238342,48.58778394312468

The ‘connect the unconnected‘ mission launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has received a lot of support from the public. This has resulted in the creation of a large network of connectivity, and has led several state governments to announce their own initiatives to connect the “unconnected” in their respective states. However, as the country continues to make progress, it is time for us to take stock of our efforts, to see how far we’ve progressed and to identify the key issues that will need urgent attention if the mission is to move in a direction that leads to its ultimate goal.

Infrastructure projects have a high tendency of time delay due to various reasons. In this study, we analyze the time overrun and its various dimensions in 25 mega infrastructural projects. Our analysis is based on a data of 3,200 mega projects undertaken over a period of more than 50 years since 1961. The findings suggest that there is a wide range of delay in infrastructure delivery across various mega-projects and the projects with higher delay also tend to cost more and vice-versa. We found that the cost over-run is directly proportional to the delay. Further, the analysis suggests that project size, project complexity as well as project location and climate are important factors for project cost and time-overrun.

AbstractThis paper investigates the long-run relationship among infrastructure investment, FDI inflows and GDP growth in the Indian economy. We use AR(p) and ARIMA models to analyse the time series properties of GDP, investment in road, rail and air transport, and FDIR (foreign direct inflow). We find evidence against the null hypothesis of long run cointegration of these variables. The result implies that infrastructure development, in turn, enhances economic development and foreign investment. However, the effect of foreign influsions on domestic investment is insignificant. Moreover, we test the significance of the causal relationship between investment-GDP and between FIRD and growth and find significant long term relation between the two, implying that foreign FIPs have a significant and positive impact on economic: 1257-1261

eScholarship, 2016.
The Government of India, in 2006, introduced the concept of m-Government as part of its Digital India program to make public sector services more citizen-centric and accessible. This has been a key driver for the adoption of mobile services for government and has resulted in the development of an ICT-based platform, which provides a host of services to citizens. These services include payment of utility bills, filing of income tax, passport and other applications to government authorities, etc. The adoption has increased from 2.6 million in FY2013 to 8.5 million citizens in June 16. However, there is a wide gap between mGovernment adoption, and its usage and benefits to the citizens, especially in rural areas of the country.

Abstract
The financing of infrastructure is one of the main challenges facing governments, businesses and civil society. The traditional public funding model for infrastructure projects is being questioned by the global recession. A number of countries have started to use innovative financing methods such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), tolling and congestion charging, or user fees – such methods could be used to help finance infrastructure more cost effectively and reduce the fiscal pressure on public finances. At the same time, new financial products, such those developed by international financial institutions, are being used by governments to finance projects. These new tools are often based on market instruments and private participation. This paper reviews current approaches to the financing and funding of urban transport infrastructure, the role of PPPs for public transport, and recent trends in financing infrastructure through tolls, congestion pricing and user: 1-8

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure development and economic growth: Prospects and perspective,"Infrastructure development and economic growth: Prospects and perspective from India
In this paper we discuss how infrastructure development affects the growth of an economy using an augmented Solow (1987) productivity growth model. We consider the effects of three important dimensions of infrastructure - physical, human-related and institutional – as well as the interactions and feedbacks among them. The model is then applied to India, where the recent growth performance is very poor, with the GDP per capita growth rate declining in the 2000s. Results suggest that in order to achieve the average growth rates experienced by the Asian Tiger Economies during the past three decades, India would need to spend an additional 5.5 % of its GDP on infrastructural development.

Abstract
Sanitation infrastructure is one of the key elements of human development. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether poor households’ choices affect sanitation levels and whether sanitation affects health. Using longitudinal data for a sample of 2000 households in three states of India, the paper first estimates the determinants of household access to sanitation. Household characteristics are then used to calculate the sanitation index. Next, household sanitation level is used as an exogenous determinant of a number of health outcomes. A set of econometric techniques are used and the results indicate that poor sanitation is associated with",220,195,0.5217391304347826,7.0772138954350625,0.8752453344814665,0.055083752984934106,0.8342857142857143,0.8242500000000005,0.7775943798363091,56.11080835603997,53.34782608695652,50.16587060356058

The study analyses the role of decentralised governance for the financing and management of public infrastructure, especially for water supply, solid waste management, and urban transport. While some literature argues in favour of devolution of power to the local governments, the study shows the importance of a balance between local and state-level responsibilities as well. Furthermore, it highlights the crucial role that local self-governments play to improve service delivery and financial sustainability of their infrastructure and services.

The infrastructure-led growth models of countries such as Korea, Taiwan
and China have attracted the attention of many scholars and policymakers across the world.
This paper examines how infrastructure investment, measured both as economic and social investment and measured by public and private infrastructure, affects growth. In the context of a panel of 29 Indian States between 19962010,
we find that economic infrastructure has had a significant negative effect on
growth. Social infrastructure on the other hand has a positive but significant
effect on growth of Indian regions. The positive effect of social infrastructure
is more visible in regions with higher levels of literacy and lower level of
health infrastructure. This suggests that social investments are likely to be
more effective in generating growth than public infrastructure in India.",223,181,0.5209580838323353,6.732262123046991,0.8725895892683286,0.057321935741939105,0.82,0.8444755244755249,0.7680347720998508,48.94497794566631,51.25149700598802,41.33397637795275

This paper analyzes the impact of road transport infrastructures on the economic performance of the country, using a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The impact has been estimated through the simulation of alternative scenarios of future road infrastructure. We use the model to explore the impacts of increasing road investments on growth, employment, productivity, and energy consumption. Our findings suggest that improving road quality is crucial, especially for improving transport efficiency. This implies that investments in roads need to be made with more consideration paid to the quality-adjusted costs and benefits of investments. Moreover, the positive link between infrastructure investments and GDP indicates the importance of investing in new transport systems. ()

Abstract
Privacy is a key concern when designing information technology. However, most existing research on privacy tends to focus on the concerns of privileged users, who have a high degree of agency over their data. We argue that privacy is an important concern for those users with less agency — the poor or disadvantaged. The paper describes an ethnographic study of identity cards that we conducted in an urban poor settlement, where we observed the interactions between government officials, beneficiaries, and the card. In the course of our study we encountered a complex and nuanced relationship between the benefits of the identity card and its potential to erode privacy. Our paper is informed by these observations.

Infrastructure projects are complex projects which are characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. In this paper, a review of the existing risk management models available in the literature for infrastructure sector is carried out and their relevance, in practice, is highlighted by the authors. This review is based on a case study conducted to study a water supply infrastructure project and to assess the risk associated there with. The authors have tried to identify the most appropriate risk assessment techniques and tools available for risk identification and evaluation, risk allocation and monitoring of risk for the project in question, which were then used in risk mitigation measures.
The paper highlights the need of developing a risk profile of a project as early as possible during the planning phase to help project management and the stakeholders in better planning. Further the author's have attempted to develop a suitable risk monitoring plan for their project, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques in conjunction with an appropriate information",227,186,0.47643979057591623,6.584528908161037,0.85883942797595,0.06188448360769614,0.8342857142857143,0.8390419161676659,0.7488132867187173,48.17930809231443,49.70157068062827,44.4960384435068

Indian infrastructure,Nonlinearity between infrastructure inequality and growth: Evidence from India,"Nonlinearity between infrastructure inequality and growth: Evidence from India
AbstractIndia is the 11th most unequal developed economy, and it is also an under-performing economy in terms of growth. The authors find that there are three sources of this underperformance. First is underinvestment in infrastructure. They show that the infrastructure investment gap, which is estimated as a ratio of infrastructure to GDP, explains about one-fourth of the growth gap between India and the average growth of advanced economies from 1960 to 2012. Second is an infrastructure quality gap which, they say, may explain as much as 25% of India's growth performance. Third, infrastructure is a significant impediment to the country'S potential for growth as measured by the output per capita. Overall, the authors' findings suggest that addressing India""s infrastructure gap should be a priority for policy makers to promote faster: 1

The 21st century is seeing a resurgence of infrastructure as a tool for economic development, especially in the context of South-South Cooperation. India’s recent initiatives, in both bilateral and multilateral arenas, are part of these efforts. In this regard, it is important to understand how these initiatives are evolving, and their relevance to the South Asian Region and beyond, as the region grapples with a range of cross-border infrastructure needs.
A recent study, funded by the Government of Germany, undertaken by India' s Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) provides an insightful overview of India s cross border infrastructure initiatives as well as those of China and Japan.

The study of the impacts of solar power projects on local societies and the environment is crucial to ensure a sustainable future for both. Yet, to date, research has largely failed to address the issue of power inequalities, which can be seen as the key driver behind the rapid development and expansion of renewable energy systems. In India, the state government has been implementing renewable projects across the country to meet the growing demand for electricity. Kerala is at the forefront of this development in the south, having installed more than 3,800 MW of grid solar in just over ten years. The expansion has led to a surge of new projects and a proliferation of land acquisition in order to access sufficient land for development.

Indian infrastructure,Do governance quality and ICT infrastructure influence the tax revenue mobilisation? An empirical analysis for India,"Do governance quality and ICT infrastructure influence the tax revenue mobilisation? An empirical analysis for India
AbstractThe main objective of this paper is to study the impact of governance qualities and information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure on the performance of tax collection in the country of India. It is argued that the quality of political institutions is the key determinant of the overall tax performance. In particular, it is believed that a better and more responsive governance structure and stronger accountability are the main preconditions for successful tax mobilizations. The empirical tests show that in general, higher tax revenues are achieved by better quality political environment. On the other hand, ICT infrastructures seem to play a very important role in tax administration and collection systems of various countries. A significant and positive relationship between these variables is revealed by the study. Thus, we conclude from our empirical findings that ICT can play the crucial role by increasing the collection of revenues. We believe that our results can help the Indian Government for the effective and efficient collection and utilisation of public taxes.

AbstractThis paper empirically estimates total factor technical productivity of manufacturing industries in India during 1982-2013 at the aggregate level as well as at disaggregated level. Total factor technological efficiency has been estimated by means of Malmquist index and DEA-based Malinvaud index to assess the efficiency gains in manufacturing industry and also to measure the technical change of industries. The estimates suggest that the rate of change in technical intensity of the Indian industry is 3.7 percent per annum, which implies that technical progress is being made at a relatively fast rate in Indian industries with the exception of textiles and food processing industries where technological improvement is slower. We also find evidence of efficiency gain in the manufacturing sector as the Malvintus Malindu index of aggregate technical efficiencies is rising steadily. This is further confirmed by DEA analysis, as aggregate total technical technical (2015)

Abstract
Anthropogenic interventions on coastlines can have profound consequences on coastal dynamic processes, such as erosion and deposition rates, and beach volume variability. However, these consequences are difficult for researchers and policy-makers to evaluate and manage due to the complex interplay of processes in dynamic coastal systems. We developed a coupled 2D–3 D modelling approach to investigate the influence of a coastal protection structure on a complex coastal setting. Our approach integrates 24 years of bathymetry data and 12 years (<10m resolution) of high-resolution (>1m) topography data collected along the ~20 km long Goplpur coastline, India. The results suggest that the structure acts as a barrier, trapping waves and sediment along its northern flank during storm events, thereby increasing shoreline erosion in the area. At the same time, the southern end of the coast, without the protection wall, shows a high erosion",239,190,0.6082474226804123,8.47190627168931,0.9056213133335266,0.041253000831217905,0.9028571428571428,0.880235294117647,0.8406592188541796,87.36168521462639,84.80927835051547,79.75533063427801

This paper studies the effects of patronage networks on electoral outcomes in two cases: India, where a “winner takes all” electoral system allows the creation of a winner-take-all patronage structure that is highly conducive for the perpetration of electoral crimes; and in Indonesia which uses a multi-seat district system that makes such networks less effective. In India the electoral winner, the Indian National Congress (INC), and its allies, have a strong presence in a large number of districts. We use an original data set from the 2004 and 2014 elections which includes information on the location and composition of voters and of candidates. By comparing the spatial structure of the distribution of violence and votes, we show that the pattern of vote allocation to the INC in these states is not uniform and differs between elections, but also that it is more concentrated around the districts with higher INC support.

Indian infrastructure,Economic growth in South Asia: Role of infrastructure,"Economic growth in South Asia: Role of infrastructure
Infrastructure in developing economies has been found to have a strong positive relationship with growth. This paper examines the impact of the quality of transport infrastructure, and electricity generation capacity on the growth of per capita income in 12 South Asian countries using annual time series data. The paper first estimates the effects of different components of capital stocks on economic growth and then examines how much of these effects can be explained by infrastructure. A structural model is used to identify the relative importance of each component of growth-infrastructure and the other factors such as labour, land, human capital and capital. It is found that the infrastructure stock explains a significant portion of economic performance: on average 22 percent of annual real GDP growth over the last three decades can attributed to infrastructure and 14 percent to the stock of physical capital in the economy. These findings indicate that developing Asian economies can improve their growth performance through better infrastructure development.

Abstract
In 2007, an Indian state government embarked on an ambitious plan to build a hospital data information system, which was to include patient records and diagnostic and therapeutic information for use across all health care settings in the state. This infrastructure would also include an electronic health record that would track each patient as he/she travels across multiple facilities. In this paper, I describe the development of this infrastructure through the lens of the Infrastrucuring concept (Crawford and Dourish, 2011), drawing on the results obtained through a 5 month ethnographic field study in this hospital and through in-depth interviews with informants. My goal is to understand the social, economic and cultural forces that drive health system reform and the ways in which the infrastructure that is created by these reforms affects and is affected by them. I find the process of building this health infrastructure to be both complex and multi-dimensional.",249,194,0.5591397849462365,7.625649981110372,0.8887516347671056,0.04901860794243279,0.8685714285714285,0.8804938271604943,0.8167223626829763,62.438162544169614,68.52150537634408,72.60320838107711

Abstract:The infrastructure development in rural India is an issue of great concern. The rural population is still facing a number of problems that include poor roads, lack of water supply, inadequate drainage systems and poor health services. In the present paper, we try to identify the impact of rural infrastructure on the level of poverty in villages. We estimate the relationship between the infrastructure and the income of families in 50 selected villages of Uttar Pradesh. Our findings suggest that rural households in these villages spend more time on income generating activities due to better road connectivity and improved health facilities.

The Ganga Queen (GQ), India’s national highway connecting the capital of West Bengal - Kolkata and the eastern state of Jharkhand was built as a flagship project by the government as part of its ambitious National Highways Project to connect the country' s far east, and its southernmost tip in 2020. However, in the aftermath of the project' completion, the road network was unable to meet the expectations of users and has failed to achieve the level of traffic it is capable of supporting. To address the issue, this paper uses a large-scale survey of over 1000 households on the GQL and a road-network travel cost model to assess the role of road infrastructure in household travel decisions. A number of factors are found to be important determinants of household' choice of travel mode, which are also found in a previous survey.

This study examines the role that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has played in India’s industrial growth as well as in infrastructure investment. We argue that F.D.I. plays a key role in the growth process in that it is responsible for the transfer of technology, capital and management expertise. However, the extent of impact of capital inflows from FDR in investment decisions of the domestic firms, as measured by the capital-output ratio, is very limited. This is particularly true in case of infrastructure investments.

The study focuses on the role of physical infrastructure in development, using secondary data on 24 states of India. It examines the extent to which infrastructure investment is an important determinant of growth at state level. The analysis shows that states which invest more in physical infrastructures are likely to see higher rates of economic growth, but that the impact of infrastructure on economic development is not uniform across states, with some states being more responsive than others to infrastructure-induced growth. Further, the analysis reveals that infrastructure investments are more likely in states whose growth rates have been higher, indicating a ""catalytic"" effect. In the absence of a strong catalytic effect, investments in infrastructure are not sufficient to induce growth and that a higher level of investment would be required. ()

Abstract/Description
This paper examines the role of the government and other actors in the provision of sanitation facilities in urban informal areas in Greater Mumbai, India. In doing so it highlights the multiple layers of governance through which this provision takes place. It focuses upon the ways in which the ‘state-in-itself’, the slum-dwellers’ (self-organised)'state in-between' and ""slums as the site of politics' all intersect to produce and sustain the current state of affairs in terms of access to and use of water and sanitation,",257,196,0.5393258426966292,7.19550421436027,0.8808450116004082,0.05294788896176746,0.7885714285714285,0.8085714285714288,0.7553915940149574,44.5,45.29213483146067,46.281109445277366

Introduction
There is a growing concern for the poor access of health care services to the people living under extremely poor conditions. The poor people are not able to access primary health facilities due to poor infrastructure, lack of human resources, inadequate supplies and poor referral mechanism. A poor health infrastructure can be defined as the “lack of adequate physical resources and human resource to provide adequate health services in a given population” [1]. The health system should be able not only to ensure health of all but also to promote healthy life – long and productive population. Health care facilities should not be restricted to hospital based services and should reach the community through primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. In this context health is defined in terms of physical, mental and social dimensions.Health should promote social justice. It is important to note that the health status of a community is not determined solely by the physical health",258,198,0.49765258215962443,7.263000324171836,0.869834911057302,0.05590372323759398,0.865,0.8620105820105812,0.7838244947510132,55.017692158070474,52.23943661971831,49.81969127251138

Abstract
This paper provides an assessment of the feasibility of applying the IPDP for developing nations. We examine the main features and advantages of using the International Public Development Partnership (IPDP) approach by looking at four different aspects of project development - the institutional environment, the technical and legal framework, financing issues and the role of international development agencies. Our analysis focuses on four projects located in four developing states: the Greater Phnom Penh Water Supply Project in Cambodia, a wastewater treatment project in Mexico, water supply project for the city of Târgovişte in Romania, and rural water project located at Tepic, Mexico. This paper is based on the findings of interviews with key informants, documents, studies carried out in the field of developing country public projects and published literature.",261,197,0.5974842767295597,7.533990064322369,0.8983947437013895,0.04615489644103853,0.8466666666666667,0.8654814814814817,0.7871482124455041,67.69965644820296,61.9811320754717,66.62256955634332

Abstract
Rainbow metaphors are used frequently in the literature to describe the structure and dynamics of spatial information management systems. In India, the implementation of a national spatial database, called the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), is currently taking place. The implementation process has been characterized by many of the features that characterize the use of rainbow metaphors. We describe in this paper how we observed the metaphor in use during the process of NSDI implementation. Our observations of this system are based on the work of other authors on NDSIs, and on an analysis of documents that describe and describe implementation plans. As a result of our observations, we discuss a number of characteristics and processes that appear in NSSDI implementation that we describe as the rainbow characteristics of implementation, based primarily on work by Gatre and Gogte in their studies of national databases for water resources and rural development in Maharashtra, India.",262,182,0.47540983606557374,6.4312250573047836,0.8572646106792575,0.06308882873474597,0.8171428571428571,0.8296855345911949,0.7454185838022631,48.08745616930915,46.82513661202186,42.70299003322259
Indian infrastructure,The overseas citizen of India and emigrant infrastructure: Tracing the deterritorializations of diaspora strategies,"The overseas citizen of India and emigrant infrastructure: Tracing the deterritorializations of diaspora strategies
By : Ramesh C. Vankayala
The concept of ‘diasporas’ in the international relations literature has evolved from a narrow conception of migrants who have left their country of origin to become “a community of people whose common characteristic [is that] they are dispersed and live in foreign countries.” 1 However, with the proliferation of transnational migration flows, the notion of the diaspora has expanded to incorporate a variety of migrant groups with different experiences, including migrant workers, students, tourists, and others.
With the rise in global migration, a new category of citizen has emerged, that of an overseas (or em) citizen, or overseas person. In this essay, I trace how the concept – and its associated terminology — of overseas citizens and overseas persons has become a central feature of global governance and policy. I also highlight how overseas individuals are increasingly becoming the subjects",263,187,0.5513513513513514,7.499189145356839,0.8859497260830643,0.05030508826840047,0.84,0.8459627329192553,0.7867730601105819,58.468528368794324,54.26486486486486,50.455882352941174

This population will be concentrated in large cities, which are already facing severe congestion and pollution problems. As of 2015, the urban mass transit share in the total urban transport share is only 7.4%.
India has been facing a major urbanization challenge over last two centuries. It is projected to have a population of over a billion people, mostly living in urban centers by 2050; which is about one-third of the estimated global urbanized population.
According to UN estimates, by the year 2030, one in four people on Earth will live in a city. By 2025 it is estimated that over half of all Indians will reside in cities with a majority of them being in slums and other non-slum settlements.

Abstract - GIS technology was introduced in the Indian scenario as a part of the Government Information Infrastructure (GII). This is a network of computers that can communicate with each other. It is used by the users to get information stored in any one of these computer systems. The Indian Government is in process of establishing a GIS-GIS based infrastructure for the entire nation. This infrastructure is being designed for data collection and storage of data in computer. GIS infrastructure can help in decision making, planning in different areas such as agriculture, health, education etc.
In this paper, the authors present an overview of GIS related policy in our country. We have discussed issues related to GIS in infrastructure management.

AbstractThis paper explores the role of public investments and infrastructure quality on manufacturing sector productivity growth in Indian state level data, using a production function framework. A two stage econometric framework is proposed to identify the effect of various public investment programs and the level of infrastructure services on the rate of growth of manufacturing production at the state and district level. The results of the analysis reveal that public infrastructure investments (especially in the areas of water supply, electricity and roads) have a positive and significant association with total factor productivity at district 2004-06.

Abstract
This paper attempts to understand and compare two of India’s largest, and fastest growing, infrastructural programmes - namely (1) Bharat Net, which aims to provide broadband connectivity to every panchayat – and ‘Digital Villages’, which will ensure digital services to all villages, in South Asian and East Asian countries. While these programmes have been implemented on different timelines, with the former having a headstart, both share similarities as they aim to connect the unconnected and are also aimed at rural areas. This paper aims at identifying the similarities and differences between the two programmes with a special focus on issues related to technology and infrastructure, funding, institutional framework, project implementation, as well as their outcomes with regard to the rural population.

Abstract
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates $100 billion in transportation, power and telecommunication infrastructure is needed to protect the U,S from natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events. In recent years, these infrastructure programs have been delayed and exceeded cost estimates. This study seeks to answer why delays and overrides occur in these projects. It also seeks ways to minimize their impact on the nation's ability to maintain its infrastructure systems and enhance homeland security....

Abstract
This study aims to provide empirical evidence regarding the challenges faced by SMEs when they go international as well as factors that contribute to international success of SME’s. The data has been collected from 50 small and medium scale enterprises in the state of Andhra Pradesh in southern India. In this research work, we use exploratory research design and survey is conducted to get the required data. Data is analysed by means of descriptive statistics and by applying ANOVA test and t-test to check if there are any significant differences among all SMEs. This study shows that there is a significant difference when the size, number of employees, sales growth rate and the number and size of the subsidiaries abroad of small businesses are compared. Also, the study finds that small business enterprises are not very effective in using information to help them go global. We also find that SMEs that are using advanced information and communication technologies such as the Internet as an important tool for international marketing are",277,190,0.5555555555555556,7.817359599705716,0.8888507971533121,0.048395910434829596,0.8685714285714284,0.8657471264367815,0.8229174074701296,63.09031239312196,67.24242424242425,55.367162802950475

Solid Waste Management refers to the activities associated with collection, transportation, processing, and final disposal or reuse of solid waste. In the USA, the collection and recycling of municipal solid wastes (MSW) are the responsibility of local governments, which are authorized by their State and County governments.
In 2009, there were an estimated 1,300 MSW landfills, 400 transfer stations, over 1000 incinerators, nearly 6000 municipal waste treatment plants, more than 2,000 privately owned solid-waste land disposal sites (""landfills""). In addition, an additional 3,600 facilities that process solid material are classified as 'transfer stations' that transfer and process municipal, construction, demolition, industrial & commercial solid materials.

Abstract
Access to a safe supply of drinking water is critical to ensure health, hygiene and overall well-being of a human. In rural areas, water scarcity has resulted in increased reliance on unprotected sources of water supply, leading to the spread of various water-related diseases. This paper assesses the status of safe drinking-water sources and sanitation coverage in the selected areas using secondary sources. It also explores the spatial patterns of these facilities and the socio-demographic variables of the area. The study also examines the association of WASH infrastructure facilities with the health status, socio-economic status and environmental variables. Using a spatial analysis, the study finds that the overall coverage of potable water facilities in India has increased from 57.5% in 1990 to 85.3% today. However, there are still large pockets of India",281,193,0.5255102040816326,7.357142857142857,0.8781031272453109,0.053177685633767284,0.8799999999999999,0.8595348837209301,0.7885592686495435,67.18540619951796,61.44897959183673,48.83619167717528

The transport sector plays an important role in the economy and in people's everyday lives. India is the world' fourth largest country by area with a population of 1.2 billion (2011) which is expected to increase by 30% and 50 million new motor vehicles by the year 2030, according to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways of India. As such, there is a pressing need for sustainable infrastructure and transport systems to support and promote long term social and economic growth.
In the context of this growing need, this study will analyse and develop policy recommendations for a low-carbon transport strategy that will be applicable to India' s urban and regional transport sectors. This project will also assess the impact of climate change on the current infrastructure stock and future infrastructure investment needs.

Abstract
The infrastructure system in India, is a major contributor of GDP and is also a critical factor for the overall development of the country. The development and maintenance of an efficient infrastructure is of utmost importance and it has been a subject matter of research for quite long. A lot of technologies and tools have been developed to help the infrastructure managers in this regard. Remote sensing satellite technology provides a cost effective way to monitor the condition of infrastructure and also helps in the identification of possible threats in an early stage. In order to meet the ever growing demands of this field, the remote sensor systems need to evolve continuously. India's own remote satellite is the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS). IRS has a long history and in recent times has also been playing a significant role in monitoring the national infrastructure. This thesis deals with the design and development on an advanced remote observation system based on the IRS. It is intended to be an all round monitoring system for national level infrastructure in a",283,196,0.4854368932038835,6.967330142916177,0.8643538325768412,0.058623142343283585,0.825,0.8538461538461539,0.7571594416030187,56.000130490960586,52.88834951456311,54.397350993377486
Indian infrastructure,Longrun growth trends and convergence across Indian States,"Longrun growth trends and convergence across Indian States
This paper analyses the long-run dynamics of real growth across the Indian states. The analysis suggests that growth is determined by long run factors, such as capital, labour, physical capital and total factor productivity. In the analysis, the authors have used the standard longrun relationship of Solow (1957) with a Cobb-Douglas production function. A long term growth model has been developed to capture the effect of longterm investment and growth. Convergence between the states is also tested with standard statistical tests. This study has found some evidence of convergence between states but at a slow pace.

In India, the construction industry plays an important role in the economic development of the country. With the growth of industrial, residential, and commercial sectors, construction activity has increased significantly in recent years. This has resulted in increased demand for cement, which is used for the manufacture of concrete.
The cement production industry consumes a large amount of cement and consumes huge resources (such as land and water) and energy. In addition, this industry is responsible for a significant amount (<20%) of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide [
This paper reviews the current state of calcium consumption in Indian cement plants and the status of various industrial by-products available for calcium use in cement industry. The present status and future trends of these industries and their byproducts with potential as raw material in concrete production are examined. Finally, opportunities and strategies for sustainable production of high calcium cement using industrial residues are identified.

Abstract
Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained significant market momentum in the automotive industry, and several countries have announced ambitious targets for electric mobility by 2030. However, the adoption of EVs faces a significant challenge in terms of the absence of an EV ecosystem. This study evaluates the viability of EV charging stations and assesses the performance of 10 charging companies operating in three different regions. The study finds that 3 out of every 4 charging facilities do not break even. It suggests that companies have to focus on reducing operational and infrastructure capex costs to reduce their charging cost and improve profitability.
The study also found that charging facility capitals are highly concentrated and the market is dominated by a few companies, indicating a potential for consolidation in future.",292,181,0.6168831168831169,7.655318158241113,0.9040936556397998,0.04384248498616626,0.8666666666666667,0.8815384615384618,0.828287436110575,73.56489068915386,74.97402597402598,64.34468954248366

Abstract
In recent times, infrastructure sector has been a key driver of economic growth in India. It is also evident that transport infrastructure is the foundation stone of the nation's economic development. This study seeks to understand how infrastructure and development in the transport sector can co-exist. The study focuses on one of India' s major corridors — the Mumbai-Chennai-Bangalore National Highway 4 (NH4). The corridor has witnessed unprecedented growth over the last decade. However, its development has not been planned in a coherent manner. While the NH4 corridor is seen by some as the engine of growth for the country' 'it has also been responsible for creating large-scale congestion that impedes economic activity.

A survey of rural roads, bridges, irrigation and power projects was made in 1961; 70% of all rural households had access to irrigation, 30% were connected to electricity, while only 7.7% had road access. The rural development expenditure for this sample was calculated for the years 1956-1963. These results are analyzed in connection with income data collected for 1942-1951. An attempt to explain the relationship between the growth of agricultural exports in this region and infrastructure expenditure is made. Finally, some of these findings are applied to",296,187,0.5517241379310345,7.277741218357472,0.8847255799259921,0.05144917933063367,0.8333333333333334,0.8346666666666667,0.7690155878377632,44.07437636157221,47.40229885057471,45.24388111888112

Abstract
The urban poor face the most acute water poverty in India, with many lacking piped water. In response to this, they have developed a system based on self-supply of water through private wells and cisterns, often located in shared spaces. The study uses ethnography and participatory mapping to examine how the urban water system has been organised and governed through the private sector and by local government, in a poor neighbourhood. Drawing on the theoretical concepts of legal geographies, the study reveals how water infrastructure and the water service are divided between public and private sectors in informal settlements, and how this division is a result of the exclusion of public infrastructure in these communities.

Abstract
The infrastructure sector is the backbone of any developing country. With the advent of globalization, it is necessary for the infrastructure in the country to be upgraded, expanded and developed with more efficiency and effectiveness. Automation of infrastructure projects can be a very effective solution to meet this demand. However there are several challenges that face the implementation and adoption of automation in these projects. This paper discusses the key challenges in automation of these infrastructure sectors and suggests a framework for addressing them.

Abstract
Infrastructure provision has been considered essential for urban development and sustainable growth, while it is still an area of concern for Indian planners. There is a growing recognition of the need for better infrastructure in Indian cities. Inadequate infrastructure is often blamed for low quality of life, environmental damage and social disparities. However, it remains unclear which types of infrastructure are associated with better quality or value of land and housing in particular, and what factors can explain these relations. This paper examines the effect of different types and levels of accessibility and infrastructure on residential value in Rajokat. Accessibility measures used were travel time to key locations and the distance to railway stations. A total of 1000 residential properties were selected as the data was available for both accessibility measures. For analysis, data were collected using Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR). GWR models were used to investigate how the accessibility of each type of facility and level of access to the facility influences",302,197,0.5528846153846154,7.973815320737669,0.8889739159722811,0.047896052861516145,0.885,0.8778260869565218,0.7973234580513457,69.33333333333333,60.21153846153846,61.56295620437956

A new book on India’s infrastructure needs
India is going through an interesting phase in its history. It is now a middle class power that is rapidly becoming rich. However, the infrastructure that will help India reach the next level of development is still lacking. A new infrastructure for the country is required, which will have to take into account both its present state and the future requirements.
The book Infrastructure for Indias development by Prof Ashok Jhunjhuniya and Dr R.K. Chaudhuri (both at the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad) is an effort in that direction. The book is the result of the authors' research work over a period of seven years, and presents the findings in a comprehensive form. In fact, this is not the first time that these authors have collaborated to come up with their views. They had earlier jointly authored a book titled Globalisation and Development in the New Millennium in",304,193,0.5977653631284916,7.997555492445714,0.9008061110859574,0.04403034177107306,0.8742857142857142,0.8993548387096764,0.811585910281068,70.36580435093747,78.79329608938548,78.10445562342795

The paper presents a framework to measure country risks in infrastructure development. The proposed framework builds on the literature of risk assessment in investment projects and on risk management in financial markets. It combines the concepts of investment risk and financial risk. In this framework, infrastructure projects are analysed according to their characteristics and the financial market's view of them. This framework allows the construction of a country-by-country infrastructure risk matrix. Using such a matrix, a set of infrastructure sectors can be identified, which are likely to provide a high level of return to capital while maintaining a low level.

ABSTRACT
This paper uses the data from the 2011 Census to analyse the extent of urban and infrastructural development of class- I cities in West bengal in 2001 and 2021. The data was extracted from various variables of housing, education, health, water and sanitation, and public utilities. We have found that the average growth rate of population in these cities is 2.6 per cent in urban areas and only 1 per- cent per year in rural areas of these class -1 cities. It has also been observed that there is an increase in the percentage share of the working age population (15-64 years) in both the class I towns of 4 percent and rural 5% respectively. In terms of literacy rate in class–I towns, it has been increased from 85.7 per hundred to 91.2 per hundreds. However, in terms literacy of rural India, we can see",307,198,0.533678756476684,7.414102232711554,0.8806767683191469,0.052207499330942084,0.9028571428571428,0.8672189349112428,0.7965906317090398,56.42836072974067,56.24352331606217,53.60888610763455

Abstract
The paper studies the health infrastructure in the state of AP and its health outcomes, in particular the maternal and infant health. The study uses the latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data for the period 2006-7, and finds that maternal mortality ratio - the proportion of mothers dying during pregnancy or childbirth – is high at 300 per 100,000 live births, but the infant mortality rate, at around 55 per1000 has declined substantially since 1995 to around half of that level. These figures are higher than the national averages by a factor of 2 to 3. However there is a large regional variation in these figures, with the highest levels in AP, which is comparable to the levels observed in India.

A report prepared for a seminar held by the Indian Finance Ministry in January, “The Infrastructure Gap and Role of Finance,” concludes that India’s infrastructure (road, water, rail) needs are so great and the country has such a large infrastructure gap ($2 trillion) that there is a case for using reserves, including foreign reserves and foreign aid, to fill the gap.
India’a foreign currency reserves stand at over US$300 billion. India has been accumulating the reserves for over two decades. The reserves are used to meet any unforeseen shortfall in the trade balance. They have been deployed to purchase gold, which is the only other asset considered a safe and stable asset by India. Foreign exchange holdings have increased from $15 billion in 2002 to 300-plus billion today, while the foreign debt has increased only marginally.

Indian infrastructure,Gig Platforms as Faux Infrastructure: A Case Study of Women Beauty Workers in India,"Gig Platforms as Faux Infrastructure: A Case Study of Women Beauty Workers in India
The gig economy is growing at a dizzying pace in the Global South. In response, many companies have adopted a business strategy that relies on the use of platforms to connect with a workforce — often in low-wage countries. These platforms are often touted as a means of providing workers with flexibility and economic opportunities, while also providing flexibility for employers to access workers inexpensively.
Despite the many promises and hype around gig work, we have yet to see a significant amount of research on this topic that is conducted from the perspective of women’s work and its intersections with gender, class, caste, race, and ability. The research that does exist has focused on gig economies in high-income countries where gig workers are mostly white, cisgender, able-bodied, native-English-speakers who are able to work from their own home.

Abstract
Road infrastructure is a key determinant to the socio-economic development of a region. It provides a platform to connect people and businesses and enables trade to flourish. This study aims to analyse the economic benefits to rural and regional development from the improvement of infrastructure by assessing the impact of different categories of roads. The study focuses on the road infrastructures of rural areas. In the Indian context there was the need to assess the benefits accruing to agricultural growth in rural India. Hence the study also focused on agriculture in general and the role of agriculture to improve the quality of life of the rural people as well as on its role in the economy. For these reasons a study is carried out to examine the relationship between infrastructure and economic growth of two states, Karnataka and India, and to evaluate their performance in infrastructure. To this end, an attempt was done in this study to measure the performance of these two countries in terms of various",319,187,0.4433497536945813,6.316761657092368,0.8469104506921046,0.06634444731109579,0.7949999999999999,0.8073743016759779,0.7190514497212795,39.459550561797755,37.50738916256157,37.33629515163222

Indian infrastructure,The challenge to governance in India,"The challenge to governance in India has emerged from three major sources.
The first is the failure of the political class to deliver. The second is that there has been an erosion of civil society institutions. And, the third is a decline in the quality of our democratic institutions and processes. This challenge is evident in our politics and governance. But, it also reflects the growing alienation in society. There is an increasing feeling of despair, cynicism and disillusionment among large segments of society with regard to the future of democracy and the polity in general. In this context I would like to recall the words of Jawaharlal Nehru. It was during his 10 years as Prime Minister of India and he was addressing the Constituent Assembly on August 15, 1948. These are his words: “I am sure that the Indian people are as eager as I am for the full development of their democratic system",321,182,0.5581395348837209,7.319931375965024,0.8867125962014413,0.05067589453190428,0.8733333333333334,0.8481081081081083,0.7586259864190196,55.45724258289704,54.325581395348834,51.00727611940299

The paper discusses the role of infrastructure development in the process of economic growth. The paper argues that India has been a victim of poor infrastructure for decades and the government is now investing heavily to improve its infrastructure. This investment has led to improved connectivity between the different states of the country and has also led the states to compete with each other to attract investments. In the long run, the paper predicts that infrastructure will be the major growth factor in regional economic development.

The Infrakrol formation is a thick to thin-bedded carbonate platform sequence, exposed on the northern slopes of the Lessar Himal, and comprises two formations with an estimated thickness of >400m: (1) the K1 formation, composed of thick (>10–15m) carbonate units, which overlies a thin (<5m), siliciclastic unit [D1] ; 2) an ~ 200 m thick succession, the C2 formation. In both cases, thick platform sequences, with a siliclstic base, were deposited in an extensional basin setting during the mid-Proteroziic (~400 Ma). The Infrax1r formation comprises a sequence of platform-derived dolomitic and siliceous carbonates that are interspersed by mudstone-shale sequences.

Indian infrastructure,The ecological impact of transportation infrastructure,"The ecological impact of transportation infrastructure has long been a concern with planners and policy makers alike. While a growing number of studies document the environmental impacts of infrastructure on land and ecosystems, little is known about the ecological effects of highway transportation on marine ecosystems. This study investigated the impacts on benthic macrofaunal communities of a marine embankment built along State Road A-1-A (SR 1) in Miami-Dade County, Florida.

Abstract
Background: Diabetic retinpathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in working age group among Indian population. DR management is a complex and time consuming procedure requiring multiple visits to an eye specialist and frequent follow-up. It also involves a number of tests for DR and cataract which can cause stress and delay in treatment among patients. This study aimed at evaluating the eye care infrastructures and resource utilisation for management of DR in Indian states.
Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 12 Indian eye hospitals in 10 states of India. The data pertaining to DR was collected by conducting a face to face interview and a structured questionnaire on “Eye Care Infrastructure and Human Resources for Managing Diabetics Retinopathy ” with the help of the study guide and the interview script. Data entry, analysis and interpretation was done using SPSS version 20 software.

Indian infrastructure,Urban Infrastructure Finance from Private Operators: What have we learned from recent experience?,"Urban Infrastructure Finance from Private Operators: What have we learned from recent experience?
The private sector has begun to provide financing for urban infrastructure, with a wide array of financial products for infrastructure development. This has led to the emergence of ‘private infrastructure finance,’ a term that embraces a whole range of different approaches to infrastructure financing that do not fall easily under the 'debt' or “equity' labels, as they can involve a mix of debt, equity, and revenue sharing with public agencies and/or government guarantees. The World Bank Group has been working with its member countries and with other agencies to better understand this new sector of infrastructure.
This paper is the second in a two-part series on Urban Infrastructure Financing. It provides an overview of private infrastructure and its potential for sustainable urban development; describes recent experiences with private financing; and identifies lessons that can be learned for the future of this important and innovative sector.",339,188,0.5604395604395604,7.560743029943232,0.8887330649996186,0.04923160197146668,0.897142857142857,0.8999999999999985,0.8245417687483139,82.6970802919708,72.35164835164835,73.42826704545455

Abstract: The paper aims at examining the role of international adjudication in shaping infrastructures and infrastructure-building projects in the context of territorial disputes. In particular, the paper will explore how the adjudicating of infrastructure is connected to territorial claims, especially in transboundary disputes, but also in non-transboundayr disputes such as the case of Western Sahara. The case study will be the 2004 International Court of Justice “Advisory Opinion ” on Western Saharan Self-Determination, which adjudicated a border dispute between Morocco and Polisario Front.

Abstract
The infrastructure sector in Indian has been witnessing a major transformation with the advent of liberalization and globalization. The Government of India has undertaken several initiatives like the Public Private Partnership, the Infrastructure Investment Fund of the Reserve Bank of india and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund to promote infrastructure development in the country. This thesis discusses the various initiatives undertaken by the Government and the issues faced in public private partnership and infrastructure investment fund. In the first chapter, an overview of PPP projects undertaken in various sectors such as energy and transportation is given. PPP is a new concept in developing infrastructure and has the potential to improve the productivity and efficiency of investment in these sectors. However, some key issues are faced while implementing PPP in energy sector such lack of transparency in procurement process, lack in capacity and expertise among public and private partners, high cost of",341,184,0.5243243243243243,7.131581834309935,0.8763216784048902,0.054551810101402566,0.8342857142857143,0.8462111801242237,0.7675520998136479,63.13579359864777,53.33513513513513,47.409795275590554

Indian infrastructure,"Engineering modernity: Water, electricity and the infrastructure landscapes of Bangalore, India","Engineering modernity: Water, electricity and the infrastructure landscapes of Bangalore, India, 1880–1940
The paper argues that the water, electric and gas infrastructure that came to be associated with the modern city of 'Bangalore' (also known as ""Bengaluru"" and ""'Garden City') was in fact the result of a complex process of appropriation and contestation of public and private resources. In a period of rapid urban development, the state, local communities, and individuals all engaged in the appropriation of these resources in ways that are still felt by citizens today. The paper will focus on 1899, a year marked by two important milestones, when a waterworks was completed and a grid electricity network was built, both of which had a significant impact on the lives of many Bangaloreans at the time.

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the role of various land acquisition instruments used by the Government of India and their impact on infrastructure development in the country. Land acquisition has been the most contentious issue for the infrastructure projects, in particular the ones that are being developed in rural areas. The government has used both the legislative and institutional measures to ensure that the land is acquired for infrastructure. This paper examines the institutional and legislative arrangements for land acquisitions, especially the impact of the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 on land prices in India.

Abstract
The paper aims to assess housing affordability and the quality of basic public infrastructure provision in cities across the country. The data for this paper was collected from a sample of 50 cities from across 22 States and 6 Union Territories using a multi-stage sampling technique. Using these data, two indices for housing accessibility and infrastructure have been built at the city level. These indices provide a measure of the extent of access that people living in urban areas have to essential infrastructure as well as their living conditions and quality. In the present research, we employ the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression to find that housing is more accessible in large cities compared to smaller cities. This is particularly evident for people with lower socio- economic groups. Housing accessibility in larger cities",346,199,0.5828877005347594,7.970869422985724,0.896817142567765,0.045418156413439756,0.8914285714285715,0.8839263803680976,0.8261046615097699,61.82611737674039,73.57219251336899,66.07875574859479

The objective of this paper is to present a framework for a set of sustainability indicators to assess the social impact of infrastructure investment, with a specific focus on the transport sector and its relationship to urban development and sustainability in cities in developing countries [1]. The proposed indicators are designed to help decision makers assess how well urban transport investment is contributing to sustainable development.
In addition to the set-out indicators in the paper, a more comprehensive list of possible indicators is included in Annex I. For the purpose of the study, this document focuses on indicators related to:

The paper presents an overview of the public private partnerships in Indian' infrastructure sector. The paper discusses the issues of public-private partnerships as a tool of development in the infrastructure sectors with special reference to India. An assessment of PPP projects is made and the paper concludes that the PPPs are an effective tool for public sector financing. However, the implementation of these schemes is not free of hurdles and therefore, PPP implementation must continue to be a continuous and iterative process. It is concluded that India must learn from the experiences of other countries and develop an optimal PPP model for itself.

The procurement of public infrastructure projects by private parties in developing economies is a relatively new phenomenon. It is now widely believed by policy-makers and practitioners that this mode of procurement has the potential to bring about improvements in delivery and efficiency in the public sector in terms of cost and quality, while at the same time creating an opportunity for private capital for investment in infrastructure sectors in these developing countries, where capital flows are otherwise not easily available. This article explores the various aspects of this phenomenon in particular in relation to social infrastructures in India, and the role that private sector participation and PPP / PFI could potentially play in delivering social outcomes. The paper discusses the issues that need to be carefully considered in undertaking the procurement analysis, with particular reference to waste-to-energy projects, the first project of its type in (South) India.

The role of political instability is explored through a panel data of 32 Indian states for the period 1901-2004. We find that the infrastructure performance of the least-developed states increases when political parties change and the number of coalition governments falls, while it declines when the political system remains stable. The results suggest that coalition parties and stable government may increase the risk of corruption and lead to more political rents for politicians, which in turn may reduce public investment. These results are robust to a variety of specifications and empirical strategies. They also remain significant after controlling for economic factors and other institutional differences such as land use regulation, and after the inclusion of lagged and lag-squared infrastructure indicators in the analysis.",351,187,0.6274509803921569,7.761140001162656,0.907346092485804,0.042410523613177376,0.8933333333333334,0.8970542635658909,0.8203550202144622,83.332916227608,77.66666666666667,61.63205882352941

Abstract
Water is a common pool resource in many parts of India, where the institutional framework and capacity is weak. This paper investigates the role that games might have in strengthening institutional frameworks in this context, by designing experimental games to assess the impact of a range of institutional measures. We test the effects of different types of water governance on the performance of common infrastructures by conducting an experiment in 10 rural water and sanitation schemes. The experimental design allows us to estimate the effect of governance types on a variety of measures such as water availability, cost, quality and quantity of service. Our results suggest that, when water is managed by a self-help group, water supply and service quality are better, while cost and water quantity are worse. When water management is through a panchayat, service quantity, supply costs and quality of services",352,184,0.49206349206349204,6.764754597315764,0.864711608578401,0.05942923846716261,0.8628571428571429,0.8555151515151515,0.7760654486420713,45.613919667590025,51.75661375661376,50.865961945031714

AbstractThis paper attempts to assess the role of the infrastructure sectors in the Indian economy from 2002-03 onwards. We estimate the capital-input productivity (Kc) for the construction, power and the transport and telecommunications sectors. It is found that the overall capital stock in these sectors is rising at a fast pace, with the highest growth rates being observed in transportation and communication sectors of about 7-8 per cent per annum. However, the growth in Kc is declining steadily for all sectors since 1986-87 with an exception of construction sector for which it is still increasing. In the long run, a higher level of K c would be required, which may be achieved by the government through the implementation of appropriate policy.",353,183,0.6052631578947368,7.462185372015077,0.900058940153167,0.045805785712152845,0.8466666666666667,0.8843749999999998,0.7886551983895738,52.96857253361212,66.35526315789474,64.40643587006252

AbstractForeign Direct Investment (FDI) into infrastructural projects of developing countries has been growing over the last two decades. In India, infrastructure investments by the foreign investors have been increasing over 30 per cent per annum from 2000 to 2015. India is an agrarian country where agriculture sector is the backbone of economic growth and development. The government of India has taken various steps for developing the agricultural sector and for improving the agriculture productivity. This research work aims to examine foreign direct investments into agriculture and non-agriculture sectors and also investigates the effect of foreign investment inflows on agriculture production. Using time series data over a period of 20 years, the paper examines the impact of FDI on nonagricultural sectors on agricultural productivity in both short and long run and estimates the parameters in the system by using a dynamic system model to understand the long term and short term dynamics between the",354,182,0.5657142857142857,7.483696565582699,0.889701891488803,0.04917353433919526,0.8685714285714284,0.8701986754966888,0.8129942746728132,58.333333333333336,58.25142857142857,54.28486855308047

The fisheries of the Indian Ocean are an essential part of food security for many of its 1.25 billion people. As a result, there is much at stake in the sustainable use of marine fisheries.
In the face of a rising global need for seafood, fisheries can play an increasingly important part in feeding a growing population – but only with sustainable fishing practices. Fisheries management and conservation are key to ensuring the long-term availability of seafood for the people of coastal communities, who are often the poorest. However, in this rapidly developing world, fishing pressure and other threats are on the rise. The oceans are not a resource that can be taken for granted. They must be used sustainably and carefully, with due respect for marine ecosystems and the services they provide to people around the world.",355,195,0.5875706214689266,7.81711869122942,0.8972674940050391,0.04570005681661267,0.88,0.8875816993464051,0.7948093675450439,68.11711711711712,73.24293785310735,71.78857033639144

Abstract
Despite the increasing attention on public spaces and public utilities, the provision of public water and sanitation services remains a challenge across low-income cities worldwide. The study presents new data from a randomized field experiment on the effects of infrastructure on sanitation mobilization in the context of water provision in a low income urban area of Delhi. We find that the presence of pipED water, but not the availability of toilets, affects mobilization to build toilets.

AbstractThis paper investigates the determinants of Public Private Partnership (PPP) in the infrastructure sector using the panel data from the year 1993-2008 covering the entire period when PPP was initiated in Indias infrastructure development. The study is undertaken by using panel ordinary least square, fixed effect regression model. Empirical results suggest that the government's expenditure and the size of infrastructure are significant determinants in PPP. In addition, the study also reveals that in case of road projects, government spending, and size are positive while government borrowing and project location are negative. Further, it is found that government expenditure, project size and bank finance have significantly and positively impact on the PPP in roads sector.
The study concludes that there should be a greater emphasis on improving project management and financial management in order to promote PPPs. It also recommends that governments should focus on infrastructure investment in rural areas to reduce ruralurban migration. Moreover, banks should increase their",358,191,0.5526315789473685,7.617500626155123,0.8869714120143601,0.04960105732290608,0.8571428571428571,0.8756626506024089,0.7982422476646663,57.34330445273086,69.80526315789474,50.85950413223141

Abstract
The research examines the Chinese and India’s investment strategies in Africa, especially on Ethiopia and Kenya. This study focuses on Chinese investment projects in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, and its surrounding industrial area. The study also looks at the investment of the Indian in Kenya’ s port town Mombasa. In this study the author argues that the main motive behind China and to some extent India to invest heavily in infrastructure in African countries is for the development of a new “dept-traps” diplomacy and a ‘’new colonialism’’ in disguise. According to the study, both China as well as India are using Africa as their own backyard and playground to pursue their national interests as a major source of raw materials for its industries as part of ’’neo-",364,184,0.5668449197860963,7.751487695747585,0.8914819851162156,0.04776654084138547,0.8342857142857143,0.8507975460122703,0.8101945320363338,58.5045045045045,64.07486631016043,54.38887996143339

Abstract
This thesis is a research work that has examined different aspects of the role infrastructural development plays in addressing the challenges associated with human settlement development. The study sought to examine different factors that have contributed to poor development of human habitation in urban and rural areas. This has been done through an analysis of factors such as lack of access to land, inadequate infrastructure, high cost of land and housing, and poor access for water, drainage and waste facilities. It has also sought answers to questions such, as why some settlements have developed at faster rates than others, why there is still a large disparity in the provision of services across regions and urban areas and why infrastructure provision has remained a constant issue in rural and small urban settlements despite government interventions over the years. To address these questions, the research has employed a mix",366,190,0.5502645502645502,7.5648868615144025,0.8860387359019704,0.05006069677475549,0.88,0.8722424242424248,0.811415733161388,56.55168884339815,59.74074074074074,53.295120279197306

Infrastructure development in India has been a top priority of the government of late. In the Union Budget 2013-14, the finance minister had made a strong case for the need for a major push in infrastructure development.
The government has launched a series of initiatives - National Highways Development Programme (NHDP), Dedicated Freight Corridor (""DFC"") and Bharatmala (“National High-Speed Rail Network”) – to address issues such as lack of infrastructure and connectivity. The National Investment Fund for Highway Infrastructure ""National Highway Investment Grid"" is another ambitious initiative in this context.

The infrastructure sector is critical for India’s growth and economic stability
In India, infrastructure development is a long-term endeavour. However, it is important for growth of the country's economy and to create jobs. The infrastructure projects undertaken by public sector enterprises in the past have been plagued by a number of challenges, mainly with respect to financing. In addition, the projects are often delayed due to land issues, lack of environmental clearances and disputes with locals. Further, due delays in infrastructure project delivery, many projects become unviable. As a result, there is an urgent need to review and improve the financing models for infrastructure.
Key challenges and issues
There are a variety of issues associated with infrastructure financing in emerging economies. Some common issues are:
· Financing the entire lifecycle: Financing infrastructure assets requires long investment cycles. Financing is needed for land",378,183,0.4918918918918919,6.69045306105365,0.864090429400791,0.059946747260712856,0.8457142857142858,0.8752795031055903,0.7632094451424315,50.943264836787904,50.01081081081081,50.92333192269714

Excerpt
This paper analyses the relationship between regional disparity and infrastructure investment in India using panel data of district level data for the years 2004-2009. The paper uses panel unit root and cointegration analysis. Using panel co-integration test, this paper finds that infrastructure spending and regional disparities cointegrate. However, the test of panel Granger causality shows that regional inequalities in infrastructure are not causally related to regional inequality in economic development.

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure development in India,"Infrastructure development in India is at a critical juncture. The government has embarked on large-scale infrastructure projects. These are estimated to cost INR 1,800 trillion and include airports, ports, roads, power plants and transmission networks.
In a move to improve the country’s competitiveness in infrastructure, the government announced the creation of a National Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency (NIPFA). NIPTA will replace a number of agencies, which will provide a platform to help investors and businesses to navigate the complex process involved in getting infrastructure investments off the ground. NIFT will also work to create a single window for investment. India will have its first dedicated infrastructure development fund under the NIFPA, to be set up with a corpus of INR10 trillion.",381,199,0.6382978723404256,7.579367289598671,0.9092802580863151,0.042210559816583726,0.9039999999999999,0.8994871794871796,0.8038928462979726,75.91107896528251,71.38297872340425,73.4958041958042
Indian infrastructure,"Place-based public investment in regional infrastructure, the locational choice of firms and regional performance: the case of India","Place-based public investment in regional infrastructure, the locational choice of firms and regional performance: the case of India
This paper examines the impact of public investments in infrastructure on the location choices, firm performance as well as the economic performance of regions. The empirical analysis focuses on India, a developing country which has witnessed a surge in public infrastructure investment, particularly in the transport sector. This study examines three main aspects of infrastructure provision: (i) the level of the provision of transport infrastructure across the country, ‘place-making’ infrastructure that is, transport links that are not only of high quality but also connect different regions and cities;,and 3) infrastructure as a locative asset. These three aspects have important implications for the firm and the regional economic development. We use a panel data of 1,200 firms from the 2004-05 and 2010-11 surveys to analyse the effect of place-specific public capital investment and locator choice on firm location decisions and their economic outcomes. Our findings show that",382,187,0.5129533678756477,7.126175932412076,0.8731503632538151,0.05550052770335213,0.8457142857142858,0.8546745562130185,0.7856023153154241,59.0282133487033,53.27979274611399,45.546842650103514

Abstract
The purpose of this article is to explore the role of infrastructure in attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to Indian districts and its impact on growth. We employ District-Level Data [DLD] in 2011 to 13 from National Sample Surveys Office – Integrated Household Survey 3 & Census 2001. The results of panel data regression analysis reveal a positive impact of road and electricity in increasing the likelihood of FID while the rest of the infrastructure variables show a negative impact. Further, road, power and telephone are important determinants of economic growth, while electricity is the least important one as the share of electricity infrastructure investment to GDP has declined from 8.3 per cent in the 12th Plan to just 4.1 per.

The World Bank has been involved in irrigation system management reforms in various countries across the globe. This study examines how the design of system level institutions, such as irrigation agencies, and the governance of irrigation management in the two selected river basins in Uzbekistan and India affect system performance. The research is based on in-depth analysis of the irrigation systems of Uzbekistan (Chilgor and Tashkent canals) and on a case study of two major irrigation projects in Madhavnagar (‘Bhakra Nangal’) and Sriganganagar districts of Rajasthan, India. It was undertaken in order to identify governance and institutional reforms that could help the countries to improve the performance of their large irrigation infrastructures and make their management more responsive to changing water demands and water availability.

ABSTRACT
The present study examines the impact that different social and infrastructure components have on the level and growth of economic performance in the state of Punjab. Social factors include per capita income, literacy rate, and human development index. The infrastructure component includes per kilometer of roads, per square kilometer power supply, water supply and sanitation. We use Ordinary Less Square – Least Squares [OLS] technique. A time series analysis has been used for the data. Based on a sample size of 25 years, we find that social factors have a positive impact on per-capita income.

Abstract
The present study focuses on determining the capital structure determinants of the stock of 50 companies listed on BSE and NSE, in the financial year 2006 –2007 to 12th December 2106 by utilizing the panel data regression approach. This study is also focused on the impact of capital goods, financial services, infrastructure, and information technology on capital structures of different companies. The study also investigates that the companies which are in same sector and have same financial leverage, then the firms in infrastructure sector have lower capital than firms of other sectors. It is concluded that for the period 01.04.2003 to till date, the ratio of debt to equity is highest in capital good sectors, followed by Financial Services and Information technology sector, which is the lowest in all the sectors considered.

This paper provides evidence on the relationship between infrastructure and population growth in aglomerations (cities) in India. Using a panel of 36 Indian cities for 1981-2001, and a fixed effects panel approach, we find that increases in the number of roads per km2 lead to a significant increase in population per sq km in both rural and urban areas; the effect is stronger in rural areas. Increases in power and water supply per capita lead, on average, to population increases of about 0.2 and 1.5 per annum respectively. These findings are robust to various robustness checks.

Abstract
The paper presents an overview of the rural and agricultural infrastructure in Southern Africa. The rural areas have been described as the most neglected in the world with an estimated rural population of 70 % of Africa’s total. As a result, the development of infrastructure such as transport, communication, education, health facilities and water has remained at a snail’ s pace, leaving the majority with little or no access to these basic human needs. Rural Africa has the poorest road network compared to the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, with only 30 000 km out of an approximate distance of more than 10",388,180,0.6470588235294118,8.003675626198989,0.9134631858974718,0.039610543110036686,0.8733333333333332,0.8635658914728674,0.8083974605716256,67.4496345327352,75.98692810457516,56.79610169491525

AbstractThis paper examines the infrastructure production function and its determinants for India over the period 1950–2000. Using a vector error-correction method, we investigate the role of infrastructure in the growth of output in different regions of India, and the contribution of the different components of capital input to the output of different infrastructure sectors. Our findings reveal that the elasticity of growth in infrastructure to its output is higher for capital and less so for labor. We find that there is a strong positive relationship between growth rates of regional GDP and infrastructure. Further, the regional differences in infrastructural inputs for a given level of GDP indicate that infrastructure is not equally important for every sector in all the regions. This finding is particularly true for the power sector; in fact, infrastructure investment in this sector is much less important in certain states. In contrast, there seems to be a significant and positive role for infrastructure for manufacturing and agriculture. These two sectors are more capital intensive in nature, indicating",391,195,0.48223350253807107,6.768469748851416,0.861953679134069,0.06016489556129504,0.8514285714285714,0.8499421965317917,0.7528069036900229,42.78300942151017,49.53807106598985,42.592285508291276

The transition to a circular economic model in India is likely to cause some changes across the multiple sectors, including transportation, energy, waste management, and water and other natural resources. However, the impacts are likely differ across multiple stakeholder groups. The current study aims at estimating the impact on the transportation sector for different stakeholder categories. It uses a multi-stage random-walk algorithm with 10 categories of stakeholders to estimate the changes for each category.

The Indian economic reform program of liberalization and globalization in 1991 has had an impact across many sectors of the economy. This impact has also influenced the financial and digital sectors. The digital revolution brought by technology has impacted various sectors such as manufacturing, retailing, agriculture, health, education, banking, and finance, which in turn is affecting the way the Indian economy operates and how people do business.
A new economy has come into existence, where digital infrastructure is the key to economic development and social transformation, in which the internet, mobile telephony and e-commerce are playing a crucial role. It is also a fact that India as a country has the largest population of internet users in the whole Asia Pacific region – the figure is around 400 million.

Introduction
The COVID–19 outbreak, which emerged in late 2019, was initially declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020 and later declared as a pandemic on the 11 March [1]. The first case in Delhi was reported on March the second week, when there was no COVID – 19 positive case registered in the country (India). The government of India announced nationwide lockdown on April 25, 21, followed by gradual unlock from May 4,202. The Indian government has taken several steps to contain the outbreak. These included a lockdown / partial lockdowns of the national territory, social distance, quarantine of affected cases, isolation of positive cases in government facilities as well as in private sector hospitals, and use of telemedicine and virtual consultations.

Abstract
Introduction
In India, immunization programmes are carried out through the public sector, where vaccine storage facilities are often inadequate. Inadequate cold-chain storage conditions are associated with vaccine failure and the loss of efficacy of the vaccine. The vial monitor (VM) is an indicator of whether a vaccine is in cold conditions and is considered an objective indicator.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted between June–August 2014 in the tribal district, Pachmarhi, Madhya Pradesh, India. A total of 50 health facilities were selected, using multi-stage sampling, to study the relationship between VM and other variables such as the type of refrigerator, temperature of refrigerators, and presence/absence of power failure at the facility. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, t-test and binary logistic regression. P-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results were presented in figures.",396,190,0.5368421052631579,7.399857751122119,0.8814468448550337,0.05202543842186139,0.84,0.8486746987951799,0.7828882044547234,58.73062015503876,57.78947368421053,48.78339140534263

Abstract
The case of crowd disaster at Eelphinstone railway road, the busiest railway line in Mumbai is presented to study the role of infrastructure and the crowd movement through the station and on to the platform during the disaster. The study uses a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies and uses statistical and spatial analysis for the analysis of the data collected. Results show that during peak hours at the time of tragedy the railway lines at station are over crowded and this leads to an increase in crowd density on both sides of platform. This in turn results in congestion on the platforms and overcrowding on train coaches.",398,183,0.5197368421052632,6.40774613466512,0.869735622560344,0.05970381110699185,0.82,0.8134374999999997,0.7532001511110189,45.89129751806472,42.57236842105263,39.31227272727273

Indian infrastructure,Resetting PPP in infrastructure model in india post-COVID-19 pandemic,"Resetting PPP in infrastructure model in india post-COVID-19 pandemic
AbstractThis paper analyses the PPP infrastructure projects in the post COVID- 19 scenario. It focuses on the challenges that PPP projects are facing due to Covid-induced economic slowdown and lockdown. This analysis is based on primary data collected from the stakeholders and government officials who are involved with PPP models in India. The challenges in PPP project due COVID -2019 are identified on different parameters such as project funding, project implementation and operations and maintenance. Based on these challenges, the paper highlights the need of restructuring of PPP model to ensure that the projects can sustain and provide long term benefits for the society. In order to overcome the financial hurdles in project development, it is suggested that government should introduce PPP policy with a focus on financing and debt management. Government should also provide incentives for investment in infra.

This paper attempts to analyze the role of physical and human infrastructure on the output growth. A panel data analysis of 22 states over the period 1999 – 2013 has been carried out to test the impact of infrastructure investment on output. It is found that public and private physical investment and public infrastructure expenditure have a significant, but different impact on growth of output of a state. The study has also examined the contribution of public expenditure on infrastructure, public sector capital goods investment, and the public-private infrastructure ratio towards growth in output per capita at constant prices for the states in the sample.",402,185,0.5476190476190477,6.147008563985761,0.8754879442638205,0.05928099497758395,0.8640000000000001,0.8725490196078436,0.752685167431888,51.21588002790049,54.34920634920635,44.355675451338456
Indian infrastructure,Publicprivate partnership infrastructure development in India,"Publicprivate partnership infrastructure development in India: The case of water and sanitation sector
Water and Sanitation (WASH), in the Indian context, has been an area where public infrastructure has played an important role. The Government of India, since its Independence, had set up public sector companies for the development of this sector through various publicprivate partnerships. However, the performance of public private partnerships in this sub-sector was not satisfactory for various reasons, and hence, there was a need to explore private sector participation in WASH sector. In recent years, private participation has taken a different shape in water sector in terms of new models, which can be broadly categorized as PublicPrivate Partnership - Build & Operate and Public Private Partnership-Transfer. Both these models have different implications for government and private partners, but the success of PPP depends on a number of factors like availability of suitable project, availability/cost of finance, political will, regulatory and institutional issues in both government ",403,189,0.5645161290322581,7.698973538621048,0.8905828469581382,0.04821173341206364,0.84,0.857777777777778,0.7970932976470804,61.79054054054055,62.516129032258064,49.93015434721042

Abstract
This project seeks to examine the impact and implications of the construction and maintenance of a major road infrastructure – the NH- 200 - in India through the life of one village in northern Manpur. In this paper, I will explore what I refer to as 'the roads not taken' that are not only the roads that could have been built in the area, but also the ones whose construction or maintenance was prevented in order to preserve the existing ‘natural’ landscape, the natural resources within the villages or to allow for the preservation of “traditional” practices. I focus on these two types of roads as they have emerged over time and the different political and social forces that shaped their evolution. By examining the ways in which these roads and their impacts have become inscribed on local land and memory, my project is concerned with both",406,193,0.5634517766497462,7.9084225486579705,0.8914155961268053,0.04732447252224117,0.84,0.8386127167630056,0.8058671871749657,64.26286155932283,63.964467005076145,49.46846846846847

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure for sustainable development using renewable energy technologies in India,"Infrastructure for sustainable development using renewable energy technologies in India
Sustainable development is a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Sustainable development can be defined in many ways. Some of them are:
• Sustainable use of resources
- The concept of sustainable use means that the resources we use now can still exist in the future.
In other words, it is using resources in such a way that they are available for future use. It is the concept that we can use the natural resources, which can replenish themselves, in a sustainable way to satisfy our needs without damaging the environment in future generation. For example, using the forests and its products for food, shelter, clothing and firewood etc. The resources of our environment are called renewable because they can replace themselves. These include water (rain and snow), sunlight, trees & plants, soil and so on. Non-renewable resources are natural substances which are not renewed or cannot be regenerated",408,193,0.45226130653266333,6.379930845075023,0.8500945665007063,0.06520879260949221,0.8285714285714285,0.8326857142857136,0.7492289881533032,42.844424138829794,51.346733668341706,42.964015151515156

This article explores the role of infrastructure in the production of water supply and sanitation services and in particular the ways it is co-produced. We use an ethnographically grounded case-study to examine the interactions of three actors - the state, a local private water company, “local entrepreneurs”, the local community and the infrastructure [a dam/waterworks, distribution network, water treatment plant, tank and pumps] -, to produce water for a population of some 100,000 in one mid-sized Indian city.

Abstract
India was among the few countries to privatize its airports and deregulate its air transportation sector in the mid of nineties. This study analyzes the investment decisions and the capacity development of India's airport operators in post privatization era in order to ascertain the impact of privatizing and regulating the Indian air cargo industry. The study also examines the effects of macroeconomic factors on the airport investment in India over the period of 1995 -2010. Using co-integration and error correction modeling approaches, the study examines various determinants of airport capacity and investment by airport operator and identifies the factors responsible for the growth in airport investments in this period. Further, we also identify the sources and magnitude of the macro factors that affect the airline industry and in turn affect airport capacities and investments. We find that the privatized airports are more likely to invest in their infrastructure and increase capacity in response to economic growth.

The World bank, a global financial institution, is increasingly becoming a key player in shaping policy and infrastructure investment in emerging postcolonial urban centers. This paper examines the ways in which policy making in urban areas has been influenced by, and has influenced, the workings of this institution. The paper begins with an exploration of how policy makers in Delhi, India have attempted to negotiate and co-opt the Bank’s policies to serve their political agendas and economic priorities. It then turns to the way the institution itself has shaped the policy process in post colonial India, through its influence on the state. By tracing the influence of one institution in two countries, it demonstrates that the bank is only one actor in a process that involves a range of other actors in different national contexts. As such, this paper argues that understanding and analysing the complex and often contradictory ways that development finance institutions influence policy is essential if we are to understand the processes",417,190,0.49765258215962443,7.263000324171836,0.869834911057302,0.05590372323759398,0.86,0.8713227513227514,0.7743188187524735,54.49272071014092,58.774647887323944,54.83478563959568

The provisioning of basic infrastructure for rural communities is crucial for the economic and social well-being of the inhabitants and the functioning of an effective society in developing countries. While a number of studies have examined water infrastructure provision in urban and peri-urban India, the question of how rural residents perceive the importance of and their access to wastewater and water management facilities and services is still largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap.
For this purpose, a Participatory GIS approach was applied in a village of northwestern India to assess the residents’ perception of water and wastewater infrastructure and to analyse their use. The data gathered during the field survey was supplemented by semi-structured interviews with local stakeholders to explore the factors affecting access and infrastructure development. In addition, water supply and sanitation facilities were inspected in order to determine the quality of services.

Indian infrastructure,"Growth of slums, availability of infrastructure and demographic outcomes in slums: Evidence from India","Growth of slums, availability of infrastructure and demographic outcomes in slums: Evidence from India
AbstractWe analyze the impact of growth of urban slum population, the availability and quality of public infrastructure in urban areas on health of the slummers, and the health outcomes of their children. The health outcome of children is measured using child anthropometric data for the period 2012-2013. Using ‘difference in difference’ approach we show that slumming growth is associated with decline in child height of 1.2 cm (p=0.05). However, slumping is positively linked with children’s growth in the first 2 years as well as in later years. Slumping and growth are not mutually exclusive. Children born in a slummy household are more susceptible to diseases than their counterparts born into non slumpy households. They are susceptible due to their early exposure to poor quality environment and low level of care and nutrition as a child. We observe that poor infrastructure leads to higher probability of diarr",421,188,0.5388888888888889,7.22995312724932,0.8809453091679659,0.05278949242835764,0.8228571428571428,0.8256410256410257,0.7906070133822114,43.23667711598746,47.61666666666667,42.76426067115588

Abstract
India’s infrastructure projects have increasingly become the focus of community protests, with a number of cases being filed to halt projects on charges of environmental and human rights violation, corruption, illegalities, inadequate social impact studies, lack of consultation, etc. It is often argued that public participation in project planning and execution, through the use of participatory approaches, has contributed to such conflicts. However, there is a dearth of empirical and theoretical studies on the relationship between public engagement in the planning of a project and its legitimacy.

Abstract
Infrastructure development is a vital factor for the growth of the economy. The study aims to identify factors that affect the delivery of infrastructure development projects. In addition, the research aims at identifying the factors affecting the duration of such projects, in order to help government and policy makers in the development of an effective policy. A structured questionnaire was developed and sent to 50 experts. Experts were also asked to provide inputs on the questionnaire in three stages. After the first stage, 40 responses were received. This was followed by a second stage where 20 experts were interviewed for validation. 10 of these responses have been excluded for analysis. Delphi technique was used to obtain the remaining 60 responses. It was found that lack of coordination is the single most important factor affecting delay in project implementation. Other factors identified as important were poor project appraisal, poor planning, lack in human resources, inadequate project management, financial crisis, and lack or insufficient monitoring/ evaluation.",426,200,0.5221674876847291,7.439741507242123,0.877707190819863,0.05299805814216374,0.8099999999999999,0.816983240223464,0.7698705367573857,44.03053188182147,46.2807881773399,44.777936229340355

In January 2015, China launched its Asian Investment Infrastructure Bank (AIIB). The new financial institution aimed to help fund development projects throughout the Asia-Pacific region. However, it has been met with opposition in the United States, who view the AII B as a challenge to its hegemony. Despite the US’s concerns, the Bank is gaining momentum with the help of countries from Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.
The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the background to the establishment of A II B, a summary of its governance, funding and financing mechanisms, and an assessment of how the bank’ potential impacts on the region’ financial architecture and on development in Asia. In this regard, there is much to be learned from the history and current operations of similar multilateral and bilateral institutions to gain a better understanding of where the new bank might go.

Abstract
Colonialism in the subcontinent of India was accompanied by a large-scale expansion of modern public and civil infrastructure, as well as an extensive public building programme, including the establishment of an Indian Public Works Department. In the context of British rule, public infrastructure was a key element of political power, and the building of colonial infrastructure became a major instrument of imperial policy. However, little has been written about public architecture and infrastructure from a historiographical perspective. The present chapter will therefore examine, from an analytical perspective, both the nature of public buildings in Colonial India and their role as symbols of power and colonial rule. It will be argued that, although the buildings were often impressive in terms of architectural design, they were, in reality, an inadequate symbol of a modernised state and a civil society. They represented the colonial power's control over the local population rather than its political and",432,186,0.5263157894736842,7.2547625011001164,0.8776727765405299,0.05368163693008349,0.8514285714285714,0.8609638554216865,0.7600403486753383,55.494858820285764,56.01052631578948,51.64218409586057

AbstractThis paper studies the determinants of infrastructure development, using data on the growth of the economy and the stock of non-traded infrastructure in India. We find that non tradeable infrastructure has a negative impact on economic growth and that the impact has been increasing over the post-1990 period, suggesting that policy makers have not fully taken advantage of economies of scale in infrastructure creation. The results also suggest that, over this period of time, the government sector has not been particularly effective at building infrastructure and it has had a limited impact in promoting economic: 1-13

Abstract
In this paper, we assess the impact of the social structure of cities, measured by the number of people living in urban clusters, on the spread of COVID 19. The analysis covers 29 states and 2 Union Territories in India. We employ the Bayesian spatial autoregressive model for the spatial transmission of coronavirus disease, as well as a time trend model to analyze the role of social structures and the government response in mitigating its impact.
We find strong evidence that the size and density of urban population are significant predictors of infections and deaths in cities and towns in 2020. In terms of mortality, the effect of density on infection is twice that of population density. Moreover, our estimates reveal that cities with large populations and a low density, like Chandigarh, Delhi NCR, and Mumbai, had a higher infection and death rate compared to cities like Lucknow,",438,184,0.5567567567567567,7.572710607566219,0.8878185977217553,0.049480769750628796,0.8342857142857143,0.8315527950310561,0.7798312478708316,55.39972899728997,57.054054054054056,51.68011855905152

Multihazards, such as earthquakes, floods, and cyclones, cause a significant loss of life and property, leading to massive economic and social disruption. In India, 90 % of the deaths, injuries, damage to properties and disruption to the livelihoods of communities, are caused by these hazards. To address this problem, the Disaster Mitigation & Preparedness Centre and Earth Observatory of India (EOI) at IIT Kanport, in collaboration with the Ministry of Earth Sciences / National Disaster Management Authority - NDMA, has undertaken an extensive research project to develop a framework to assess the vulnerability of a structure or infrastructure system to a particular hazard. The research work included a multi-step assessment process which started with an assessment of vulnerability at the national and local scale using the Vulnerability Index [",439,188,0.5869565217391305,7.961865632364445,0.8978310462008351,0.04511133423676465,0.8571428571428571,0.8544999999999989,0.7937471636727179,65.9165132674656,62.619565217391305,53.82801418439716

Description
The development of infrastructure and services is crucial to the economic growth, competitiveness and well-being of countries around the world, including India. India has made considerable investments in its infrastructure over the recent past, yet the sector’s performance has been poor, with significant inefficiencies, under-capitalization and underperformance. This book examines the challenges that infrastructure investment faces in the country and how it should be financed. The authors present a detailed study of the issues in infrastructure financing and the policy responses needed by the government. It also looks at the performance of various types of government financing, and presents an overview of institutional issues that need to be addressed.

Indian infrastructure,"Provisioning health care infrastructure in communities: Empirical evidences from West Bengal, India","Provisioning health care infrastructure in communities: Empirical evidences from West Bengal, India
AbstractThis article presents empirical evidances for assessing the extent of provisioning of health infrastructure and health service delivery in West Benga. The data are taken from a household survey in 1998. A multinomial logistic regression model has been adopted for the analysis. It is found that the demand for and utilization of primary care has increased with age, female gender, urban residence and higher education. Demand for hospital services has also increased over the period of the survey but has declined over time. Provisioning has improved over a period and has reached the rural communities as well. Female gender and urban residency have had a positive effect on the use of modern health facilities. However, the level of education and rural or urban resident status have not had any influence on health services utilization. Finally, this paper concludes that in the absence of adequate supply of infrastructure the need for health provision will be met through out-of-pocket expenditure or private health): ",450,188,0.533678756476684,7.414102232711554,0.8806767683191469,0.052207499330942084,0.8742857142857142,0.8594082840236683,0.7903451564604318,57.16269176216065,58.1139896373057,49.768489583333334

Urban planning in Brazil is a complex phenomenon in its historical development, in the sense that the materialization of the urban space is strongly related to the political-ideological and cultural contexts of a given moment. As a material manifestation of social relations, urban planning is an expression of power. This paper will analyze some of these relations in Brazilian urban history through the construction and management of infrastructures, and will focus on the relationship between urban development and the formation of urban identities, as well as on its impact on social, economic and ethnic relations of exclusion.",451,194,0.5739130434782609,6.1545317343860715,0.8829746408768199,0.05678918899779055,0.8200000000000001,0.8290109890109902,0.7492445243361117,53.321220930232556,49.08695652173913,47.84770114942529

Abstract
Rapid urbanization (URB) in the Asia Pacific is often seen as the key driver of economic, social and cultural change. In this thesis I explore the implications of this phenomenon in three Asian countries - India, China, and Bangladesh. I look at the challenges of infrastructure development, governance issues of land and environment, gender and class dynamics and their implications on urban growth. These issues have been explored in a historical perspective in each country. The focus is on the last two decades as a period of URB in these countries. India has undergone a rapid growth of urban population from 30% in 1991 to 37.7% 2011. This has brought along its own set of challenges, particularly for the poor. China has experienced the largest scale urban URM in any country in history with urbanisation reaching ",453,194,0.5642458100558659,7.549094436794552,0.8896813712303504,0.0489684090584754,0.8628571428571429,0.8616774193548382,0.7973138588552113,55.08588664178457,66.50279329608938,53.1541308411215

Abstract
In the last few decades, the road has been the backbone of infrastructure projects in India. However, there has not been a corresponding growth in road networks in urban areas and the existing roads have not seen much maintenance. The construction and maintenance of the roads in a country like India is one of its most significant development issues, but little attention has so far been paid to the impacts of roads on local communities living nearby. In India, many people are affected by road construction projects, and a growing literature shows that the environmental, economic and social impacts are not well managed. This paper examines the issue of environmental injustice from the perspective of those who are directly affected. It analyses the case of a proposed road development in Delhi, India that was to be built in an area with low economic status. A participatory action research project that used action-based research methods is presented in this paper.

Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of regional infrastructure, especially roads and electricity, on income levels in South Asian countries using time series data from 1985 to 2005. The econometric analysis is based on the system GMM model using panel data of 14 South American countries. It has been found that the level of income per capita in a region has positive correlation with the amount of road infrastructure and the number of kilowatts of electricity produced. However, the effects of these two types of infrastructural development on economic growth are different. Road infrastructurally developed regions show higher rates of growth in income but the effect of electrical infrastructure is limited.

The objective of the present study is to examine the impact of different kinds of public expenditure (health, education and transport) on reducing income inequalities in Indian States during the period 2002-07. We use a newly developed index of income equality to measure the extent of inequality and a panel data approach in order to capture the influence of various factors. The empirical results indicate that health and educational infrastructure have reduced the gap between rich and poor but transport has increased inequalities.

Abstract
In this talk, we will introduce a two-year research project, supported through the UVA DRI, that explores the digital infrastructure of digital humanists in the humanities in South Asia - the region comprising the Indian subcontinent and the surrounding countries – from social, technical, and institutional perspectives. We will argue that it is critical for digital historians to engage with and understand the material, institutional, socio-political and cultural dimensions of the technological infrastructures of their field, in order to build the kinds of communities, collaborations, tools and methods that are necessary to conduct research in an increasingly digital world. Our research is based on a ‘situational",463,187,0.5291005291005291,7.273929674533079,0.8785563616018374,0.053347540545389455,0.8285714285714285,0.8407272727272728,0.7841873809256463,57.94469309462916,58.46031746031746,54.7970625798212

Abstract: The Chinese National Metrology Institute (NCMI) has been working as the national measurement standards institute since its establishment 20 years ago. NCMI has also established a national network on metrological infrastructure with the support of other metrologists, universities, and other research institutes. In China, metrolo- logical institutes play an important role in maintaining and promoting the met- rical infrastructure. The National Institute of Metrological Science, the Chinese Met- rology Institute, is the main body for the maintenance of the state metr- ological standards. It also carries out the work on the establishment and operation of metror- eological laboratories and testing centres, as well as on training",465,187,0.5986842105263158,7.381074661449696,0.8978835160986257,0.046802843460270555,0.8533333333333332,0.8406250000000006,0.8032572047142625,61.07205486333818,50.68421052631579,46.85235556522685
Indian infrastructure,Globalisation and the changing face of port infrastructure: The Indian perspective,"Globalisation and the changing face of port infrastructure: The Indian perspective
Abstract
The paper examines the impact of economic liberalisation on port and port-related infrastructure in India, with specific reference to port capacity development and management, port governance and regulation, and private investment in infrastructure. While globalisation of Indian economy has opened up new vistas of growth, the country’s ports remain the weak link in international trade. Port capacity constraints, lack of proper regulatory framework, absence of a unified system for tariff setting and determination, non-availability of modern equipment and technology, poor infrastructure and services, high logistics cost, etc., pose a challenge to the efficient functioning of the ports. Globalisation has also led to a shift in the ownership of ports from the government sector to private and institutional investors. However, in spite of these changes, it may be concluded that the Indian ports have been unable to keep pace with the changes in global trade and remain in a state of relative ‘",466,182,0.5421052631578948,7.47240537613312,0.8833062178655614,0.051209477885474204,0.8285714285714285,0.8371084337349404,0.748140519148937,51.19008511665495,47.97894736842105,50.056308799114554

Abstract
A large body of empirical studies has established that the location, quality and accessibility of schools affect students’ learning outcomes. However, few studies explore the impact of public infrastructure on private school choice and school quality. Using a unique dataset with a detailed geographic information system for the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, this study estimates the effect of infrastructure development around private and public schools on the probability of students achieving the minimum level of primary schooling. In addition, it investigates how the infrastructure around schools may influence the quality of the private education offered. This paper shows that students living in low-infrastructure areas are 2.1 times more likely to drop out of school. Moreover, the presence of higher education infrastructure is negatively related to enrolment in private primary schools. The proximity to public primary, secondary and tertiary education facilities also influences schooling outcomes, especially in terms of dropout rates in public and private private schooling and enrolments in primary education.

Abstract:The Deccani vol canes (India), with their large size and diversity, represent a unique record of continental volcani a during the Cenozoic. Here we document a large fauna with a diversity of species that lived in the infa- and intertrappi ane zones of these vol ca ne s in a time range of ~ 70 m.y., which spans the late Cenomanian into the early Albian ages. The faunal record is composed of molluscs, crustaceans, fishes, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, insects, and birds. This fauna is a record from a deep and wide marine environment. Although some taxa may represent shallow marine forms, most tax- ons appear to be marine or at least marine-derived.

Abstract:
This paper analyses the relationship between health infrastructure and economic development in a panel setting. This study uses panel data for 16 countries, covering the period from 1970 to 2014, based on primary and secondary data from World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development. We employ two methods — panel co-integration and vector auto-regression (VAR) for cointegration analysis and impulse response function approach for impact evaluation. The paper provides strong evidence of the cointegrating relationship among health inputs and health output. It is further established that an increase in health input leads to an increasing health outcome. An increase of 1 percentage point in public health expenditure leads 0.8 percentage points and increase 2 per cent point of private health spending leads, respectively, to a decline in infant and adult mortality. Our findings suggest that government’s health policies should be directed in such a manner that it increases the efficiency of health",470,195,0.5978835978835979,8.21954053222238,0.9018725636949785,0.04310524170672786,0.8628571428571429,0.8601212121212118,0.8297895294031885,63.46203623813632,69.85714285714286,63.04661654135338

Abstract:
The paper investigates the effect of banking outreach in India on the financial inclusion of the rural poor. The rural households in this study are selected from a nationally representative sample of over 20,000 households that is representative of India's rural population. Banking outreach is defined as the number of branches per 1000 people residing in a district. It is found that a 10% increase in the banking coverage in districts leads to a higher probability of having a formal bank account for the households. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that banking services are complementary. However, the study also reveals a significant impact of branch density on formal savings. These savings are found to be positively correlated with branch densities as well as with banking penetration in rural India.",471,199,0.5345911949685535,6.740938478604225,0.8764520060458808,0.05612253808692386,0.84,0.8468148148148152,0.7705962012054696,55.57497110939907,51.39622641509434,48.66602010227473

In this paper empirical analysis of exit events from 100 Venture Capital funded portfolio companies in the infrastructure sector is done. The results are based on a survey conducted among the founders of the 50 portfolio exits and 25 of their investors. We find that in general the average venture capitalists get 2 to 3 times of his/her money back, though a few firms do extremely well. In terms of returns, we see that exits through trade sales or initial public offerings are more profitable than through buyouts. However in terms investment returns venture funds do poorly, since the portfolio firms are mostly in growth phase. There is a clear correlation between the size of venture capitalist’s commitment and the investment made by him. This indicates that the venture fund managers do not invest aggressively when they know that they have a limited amount of fund to deploy, and are therefore more conservative with the fund they are entrusted",472,181,0.6216216216216216,8.454968154078788,0.9089288713939454,0.040169488471084945,0.9142857142857143,0.918757763975154,0.8332780823105721,88.56669565982234,92.4972972972973,83.746408045977

Abstract
This paper aims to present an overview of the current status and future needs of adaptive education in India, particularly for disaster prone urban areas and the role of higher educational institutions in providing adaptive infrastructure. A review of current adaptive design and construction practices in higher eduction institutes was carried out to assess the state of adaptation in this area. These practices were then evaluated based on a set of indicators to identify gaps in adaptive capacity in Indian educational infrastructure design practice. The identified gaps were assessed for current practices, as well as for future adaptation requirements. This analysis was followed by a discussion of potential adaptive pathway opportunities in urban India and suggested measures for improving disaster resilience. It is concluded that adaptive educational practices are still nascent in many parts of India. Current and emerging practices require greater attention from educational stakeholders as part of an adaptive strategy for infrastructure for the disaster risk and climate change era to develop.

This paper presents some of the main findings and recommendations emerging from a recent research project on public employment and poverty reduction, which was conducted in India for UNDP, the United Nations Development Programme. In this paper the authors explore the extent to which the employment programmes and public investment programmes of India's successive governments - the Planning Commission and the Department for Public Works (DPW) – have contributed to the eradication of poverty and to improvements in the living conditions of rural people. The paper argues that there are many examples of success.
In the period 1993-94, when the DPW was given the additional task of providing employment for unskilled and semi-skilled people, it achieved a significant increase in rural employment, especially in small-scale construction works. But, despite the efforts of successive DPWs, employment through the public work programmes remained limited to a small fraction of all",478,184,0.5638297872340425,7.7308445493884115,0.890574005634885,0.04811715000370123,0.8628571428571429,0.8753658536585371,0.785297952395914,69.58077948427584,64.25,63.89099117728151

Abstract
The infra orbitalforamenis a rare foramina. In this study we evaluated the infraorbitalforamina of 100 south Indian dry skull specimens. The mean depth of theforamain (MFD) was 8.2mm [range: 5.3mm to 9.8mm]. The infra-orbita foraminal position was observed to be slightly superior in males 0.26mm and slightly inferior in females -0mm. This position offoramin was seen to have a statistical significant relation with the positionof the maxilla. Foramina position showed no significant association with skull length. However, the length of foramin in relation to the distance from the foramenta was significantly correlated in male 1.03mm/cm, but in female 2.5mm for each millimeter increase.

Infrastructure development in India is one of the fastest-growing sectors that contributes to the economy of India to a great extent. Since Independence, India has been witnessing a massive shift in the way the country has developed infrastructure. The government has taken initiatives for the growth of different sectors.
From roads to airports, there has seen a lot of improvement in infrastructure in recent years. However, the government can only do its best, and the rest of it is left on individuals to take care of. Infrastructure plays a very significant role in a country and is responsible for a smooth and easy way for people to commute. There has to be a proper flow of traffic, so the infrastructure of a particular city or country needs to support the movement of people. It would help if you considered the importance of infrastructure as well as the challenges India faces in this sector. Read on to know more about the current situation of this industry.

Indian infrastructure,Village transportation infrastructure and women's non-agricultural employment in India: The conditioning role of community gender context,"Village transportation infrastructure and women's non-agricultural employment in India: The conditioning role of community gender context
AbstractWomen in many developing communities face constraints that make it difficult for them to access nonagriculture employment. This paper investigates whether transportation and other infrastructural development conditions women’s employment choices and their nonfarm earnings. The paper is based on data collected from the 2006 India Demographic and Health Survey. Logistic regression is employed to analyze the effects of infrastructure on women. It is found that the distance to transportation facilities significantly influences the probability of women being engaged in non farm activities in both urban and rural areas. However, there is no evidence that transportation conditions affect non‐farm wage rates and this may suggest that women are able to find non agricultural jobs that have the characteristics that they want. These findings support the argument that infrastructure is important, and can facilitate women employment but cannot guarantee women a better earnings from non agriculture): 8 (2011)

Indian infrastructure,National development banks and sustainable infrastructure in South Asia,"National development banks and sustainable infrastructure in South Asia
The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are two leading international organizations providing financial assistance to the public sector for infrastructure investments. In this article, I analyze the role of these institutions in supporting infrastructure investment projects in four South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan. I show that the WB and ADB are major financiers of public infrastructure and have supported a wide range of investments in the countries under study, including roads, ports, energy, water and sanitation, transport and logistics, telecommunications, railways and airports (Table 1). This is despite the fact that these four countries have some of the lowest public investment in infrastructure per capita and per GDP.
A recent analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute estimated that by 2050, South Asians will be the largest population group with an annual household income of less than US$10,000, with 600 million people falling into that bracket.1 To meet the infrastructure needs of a growing economy and",486,196,0.5989583333333334,8.299410119600871,0.9025080941789133,0.04269778538000533,0.8742857142857143,0.8835714285714296,0.8048049108759211,73.63502066390939,73.51041666666667,56.184343640368766

Abstract
The Belt. The Indian Government is yet to formulate a comprehensive strategy in this regard. This paper argues that India and China can benefit from cooperation to address the challenges of development and to achieve sustainable development goals. It is proposed that there needs to be a new strategic paradigm to enhance the benefits of cooperation. India’s economic growth and poverty reduction can be achieved if the two major powers cooperate on infrastructure development, which can create jobs and improve economic prospects for their populations. A strategic dialogue among the three countries, including their development institutions and the financial institutions, would be in order. China and Japan have already started the process of economic cooperation; it is time for India too to develop its own strategy for cooperation with the Chinese government.

AbstractDigital transformation in the delivery of public sector services in cities is a complex process of change. Smart digital infrastructures are a prerequisite for cities to successfully develop their digital transformation. This research investigates the role of the determinants of diffusion of digital smart infrastructures that cities implement in their smart city strategies. The study aims to understand the factors that influence the diffusion process and to identify the most relevant ones. In particular, the study analyzes the impact of three factors in influencing diffusion: (1) government policies, ; 2) the ICT sector, and 3) citizens.

Policymakers in the developed world have a growing interest in using development assistance to support security in developing nations. The use of military assistance has historically been limited to a few situations such as post-conflict or fragile states, although a number of donors have begun to consider military aid for development purposes.
A recent report commissioned by the Swedish International Development Agency and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs examines the possible use and impact of a military component within a broader peacebuilding assistance strategy. It examines how military assets could be used to promote peace and security by assisting rural communities to manage the impacts of armed violence and insecurity. A number the key issues examined by this report are explored in further detail in this article.

Abstract
The objective of this paper is to examine the potential use of sovereign and sub sovereign bonds to finance infrastructure investment in sub Saharan Africa. In sub saharan Africa, the infrastructure deficit and the lack of access to credit are key constraints to business growth. This paper argues that the issuance of infrastructure specific subsovreign debt securities can help to overcome these barriers. It also examines the use by sub sovegiron countries of guarantees, sovereign, and other public instruments to facilitate debt issuance by private investors. The paper examines these issues in the light of the recent issuance and successful issuance, of a sovereign sub debt instrument by a developing country, Mauritius.",492,184,0.4779874213836478,6.027192051457895,0.8543726942776757,0.06615221947620104,0.8533333333333334,0.8536296296296291,0.7397766486512326,53.0,45.119496855345915,46.13207412687099

Rural Infrastructure in India: The Indian government had been working hard for the development and growth of rural infrastructure, to make the life comfortable for villagers. This article discusses how the government has been trying to improve the rural and agricultural sector infrastructure. The main emphasis has always been on rural roads, but it is the connectivity of villages to cities that has not been properly addressed. Rural roads are the main arteries of the country and are also the backbone of our rural economy. These rural road networks have been in a bad shape for decades now. It is important for us to understand how our government is trying its best to develop the infrastructure network to connect these rural areas to urban cities.

This paper analyzes the relationship between transport and bank branches in 36 districts of India from 2001 to 2011. We investigate whether there is a link between the two at the aggregate, state, or regional level. The data set contains 2,300 districts. At the regional scale, we use the district level distance to the state headquarters as a proxy for bank penetration. Transport infrastructure is proxied by distance of the center of district to state capital. Our empirical analysis shows that transport does not impact banking, but banking impacts transport. In contrast to earlier research, the effect of banking is more significant on rural than urban areas.",494,200,0.5869565217391305,6.895177899145864,0.8918658213012698,0.0505328452368708,0.8560000000000001,0.8677192982456142,0.7889560338360858,60.65860735009671,59.08695652173913,44.46781853914183
Indian infrastructure,Dispute Resolution: Weighing the Need For a Construction Law in India,"Dispute Resolution: Weighing the Need For a Construction Law in India
Disputes in construction projects are inevitable, and a large number of cases go for arbitration. The Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 (“the 1976 Act”) and the Arbitration and Conciliation Act (2015) “the Act” have been the two most important laws on arbitration in the country since India became a Republic.
In 2016, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry introduced the construction sector dispute resolution (""CSDR"") Scheme, under which, disputes arising out of a construction contract are to be referred to a single arbitrator. This arbitral process is meant to ensure speedy resolution of disputes in a cost effective manner with a minimum of interference by the Courts. In India, arbitration has been accepted as a preferred method of dispute redressal. While, in many cases, there is a need of an alternative means of adjudication and adjudications have resulted",495,182,0.5056818181818182,6.708627416855241,0.8681269246824193,0.05872737981298054,0.8228571428571428,0.8252631578947373,0.7527978265804981,50.49338132252568,45.52272727272727,44.12002348796242

The Infrastructure in India is not sufficient for the growth of the nation. Fearing this, the government has decided to attract the foreign investment. The main concern is to bring the FII in the infrastructure. But the scenario is that there is no such clear cut FID policy and the policy is very confusing for investors. It is important to have proper FIDA policy in place.

Abstract
Cyclones are one of the most important natural calamities in tropical and subtropical regions. The cyclone that struck the state of Tamilnadu in the year 1999 was called ‘Gaja’ cycloon. This paper presents an assessment of impact of cyclonic conditions on paddy fields and rural infrastructure in Thekkadi village, in Pudukottay District. Data collected include, paddies damaged, the extent of land damage, damage to crops in paddys, crop yields, farm income and damage in non-agricultural land. It also presents data regarding the impact on rural infrastructures such as roads, irrigation system, electricity and water supply facilities. Based on the survey it is found that in 30 out of 100 paddying families there was damage of atleast 10% paddi land, 7 out 60 paddiering families had damage exceeding 25 – 35 % of their paddie land and the total",498,198,0.5977653631284916,7.997555492445714,0.9008061110859574,0.04403034177107306,0.8857142857142858,0.8670967741935482,0.8051593082960505,61.3113514770877,68.46927374301676,51.627414673205884

This study aims to identify the main characteristics of foreign investments of firms from Indian origin and to analyze the determinants of their involvement in infrastructural activities. This study also aims at highlighting how foreign investment from India impacts the development of infrastructure in partner countries. Our analysis uses a panel of developing and developing economies. The main results of the study are twofold. At the macro-economic level, it appears that the level of development has a significant impact on infrastructure development. Furthermore, the presence of FDI from the developing world does not affect the infrastructure of partner developing states.
