The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has been a vocal advocate for action on climate change, particularly at the COP meetings and through the G7 and G20 forums.
However, the government’s approach to climate action has faced significant pushback from within, especially from the country’
s most populous state – Uttar Pradesh (UP), which is also the site of its largest coal-fired power plant. In 2017, UP’ s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, took over and has since pursued a number of anti-environment initiatives, including an order to stop all tree-felling in the state. He’ also pushed for a controversial new state-level forest policy that allows for increased felling to be carried out by local villagers, and he launched the UP Solar Mission.

Indian climate,Water resources and climate change: An Indian perspective,"Water resources and climate change: An Indian perspective
The Indian monsoon is one of the largest and most influential climate systems affecting the global climate. The Indian summer monsoons, which are driven primarily by the tropical Pacific Ocean, play a significant role in regional climate and weather systems and also affect large areas of other continents through moisture transport and the associated atmospheric teleconnections. However, the mon So, it is critical that climate scientists, hydrologists and policy-makers work together to better understand and manage the potential impacts of future climate variability and change on Indian water resources systems.
This paper will first present the state of knowledge on climate impacts on water supply for the Indian region and then present key climate scenarios and their potential implications for India’s water availability and demand. Finally, this paper discusses the challenges of water demand and supply under future changes in climate in the face of increasing populations and rapid urbanization.",2,180,0.56,7.408103670980854,0.8877362008454198,0.05004988623368693,0.8628571428571429,0.8736423841059604,0.7744668121216637,63.68655454644205,57.674285714285716,62.71826470588235

Abstract. The Indian subcontinent experiences extreme variability in temperature, precipitation, and wind fields. It is also the centre of origin of several climatic regimes of global significance. This variability is largely influenced by the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the South-Asian monsoon – the two major climate systems. However, the nature and intensity of these climatic systems are still not well understood in the context of IOD and monsoons. In the present study, we use the fractal properties of the IDFI and MDFD datasets, to quantify the dynamical complexity of climate. We find that the MDR has an intermediate range of spatial scale, while the IDDR is at a fine-scale. Furthermore, MDA has the highest range in its time scale.
Based on the time-space properties, it is evident that MDP and MPD are at the intermediate and fine ranges",3,198,0.5580110497237569,7.50727087709638,0.8877797734776209,0.049706024485297436,0.8514285714285714,0.8545222929936307,0.771325800564466,57.6107099879663,54.86740331491713,51.23661971830986

Abstract :
In India, the glass and glass products industry is a rapidly growing segment with an expected annual growth rate of more than 15% in the next few years. The glass industry in India has come up with some new technologies in manufacturing glass, such as insulating glass to reduce heat transfer, low iron and low E glass for solar control etc.
With a wide spectrum of glass options available, it is essential to select appropriate glass in order to achieve the desired performance for the application. In order for a particular glass option to perform optimally, its energy efficiency, thermal performance should be taken into consideration. Thermal performance of a building is one of the essential factors for achieving energy saving and sustainable building, and hence energy ratings is given by the government of India. This study aims to review the various energy rating systems for different kinds of glazing, glass types, thicknesses and spacings.

The Indian Ocean has a strong influence on global climate through a large-scale heat exchange with the atmosphere. Its circulation is driven by the monsoons, which are the dominant mode of tropical ocean-atmosphere interaction. The monsoon circulation can be strongly modulated by external forcing, for example in response to changes in the atmospheric circulation due to greenhouse warming. In a recent study we have shown that the circulation in model simulations of the twentieth century is modelled realistically, but that there are large deviations from a realistic circulation that occur on multiyear to centennial time scale, and can only be explained by a non-",6,194,0.6107784431137725,7.892996971848196,0.9036690904282911,0.04333927013280893,0.8666666666666667,0.8744055944055945,0.8258942432041301,71.52008608321377,77.73053892215569,62.630795574288726

The passive solar water distillation system, which has been designed by Dr. P.R.K. Prasad and his team, was used for distilling water under the different climatic condition of Rajasthan. The solar energy was utilized for the heat transfer through two types of solar collectors which are the parabolic solar dish collector of 3.5 m diameter and 0.7 m focal length and the flat plate collectors of area 7.4 m2 each.
Passive solar collector was installed in Rajasthan to test its performance under different weather conditions in a typical climate. In India, the temperature varies from 35°C to 45 °C. This temperature variation was studied with and without heat-storage system in which the water in the storage tank is pre-heated before storing it in it.

Indian climate,Changing climate discourse and politics in India. Climate change as challenge and opportunity for diplomacy and development,"Changing climate discourse and politics in India. Climate change as challenge and opportunity for diplomacy and development cooperation
This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of how climate change has become a key foreign policy and security priority for India in recent years, and of the opportunities and challenges this has posed for Indian diplomacy. We argue that while India’s response to climate has been driven in large measure by domestic considerations, the Indian Government’
s new position has opened up opportunities to promote international cooperation for tackling climate and related development goals and to build on new global momentum for addressing climate. But in doing so, a critical issue that must be considered is whether the country is prepared to assume the role of an effective leader for this new initiative. While there are important reasons for being optimistic about India's emerging diplomatic agenda on climate, there is also the concern that this agenda is still under development.
The Indian government has a long track record of engagement in the field of climate politics, beginning with the signing of The United Nations Framework",13,186,0.5495049504950495,7.80993274650624,0.8872066123601872,0.04892676627723248,0.9049999999999999,0.9058426966292125,0.8047405989342881,75.64212062594413,73.46534653465346,81.51120136589404

Abstract:
The impacts of climate change on agriculture in India are likely to be significant in the coming decades. The impacts will be felt both at the sector-level and at a farm- and household- level. They are expected to have significant implications for the production of food and agricultural goods, and will affect rural livelihoods. This study, commissioned by the Government of India’s National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) is designed to assess the impacts – both direct and indirect - of various climate scenarios on crop production in six Indian agroclimatic regions. It also assesses the extent to which adaptation actions in agriculture may reduce such impacts.

Abstract
The paper focuses on the political significance of the policy stories of Indian political actors in climate policy. I use a'storyline approach' and a discourse-analytical method to analyze how (1) the climate change discourse is articulated by Indian policy actors, 2) how these storyline-articulation processes are influenced by the 4-D ('dominant discourse') of climate and development, and 3) what the consequences of these story-lines can be for the opening up of new ‘political spaces’ within climate discourse and policy in India. Using a comparative analysis of interviews conducted with 18 policy-actors in the Indian context, the empirical analysis shows that climate – and especially climate-related development - policy is highly contested in terms of storyline articulation, which in turn has",15,184,0.5141242937853108,6.839978854825743,0.8714700577786099,0.057175921148478456,0.8742857142857143,0.8653594771241828,0.7734417020632358,55.716318443804035,51.152542372881356,50.658135775862064

Abstract
The performance of an Air Conditioning system is directly related to the efficiency of evaporator, condenser and the compressor. The heat rejection of the air-conditioner is done by a fan that drives the indoor air flow rate. It is observed that the heat load of any air conditioner system increases when the ambient temperature of a zone increases. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the theoretical energy efficiency for air cooler using evaporating and condensing heat pipes. This system has the ability to reject heat to any external zone and to absorb heat from any internal zone. A theoretical analysis for the performance and energy savings of heat-pipe based system in a single zone has been presented. In the proposed system, heat transfer is achieved by passing the evaporant (hot plate) to a condensor - which is the cool side of condencer. Heat from the hot side – condenc",20,184,0.4708994708994709,6.4737974103344404,0.8563244957904681,0.0631135141148179,0.8685714285714285,0.8509090909090907,0.7451217132138139,50.24883900928793,51.31216931216931,46.36659959758551

In present study, the genetic optimization algorithm – GA is applied on retrofits and building systems to maximize energy savings. GA based optimization method was applied for different retrofitting measures and combinations on a building with 10% heat gain reduction. It is found that 15.1% increase in energy reduction is achieved by integrating all the possible retrofit measures. This method can be used for other building types also, but in this study the method has been applied only on multi retrofitted building and the building in focus is an institutional building.",21,200,0.49714285714285716,6.576581830360554,0.8646840626509028,0.06032708068788636,0.9028571428571429,0.8850331125827814,0.7764800557193611,55.531183739124074,57.42857142857143,57.021437881594295

Abstract
Photovoltaic module degradation is a crucial concern for solar PV plant owners and manufacturers. The primary concern is that the degradation may be caused due to external factors such as weathering, UV radiation and mechanical damage. This study aims to determine if the multi crystalline silicon solar modules degrade due the external environment of western Himalayas by measuring their degradation over the first four years of operation. A laboratory set up was used to expose solar panels to different levels of heat, humidity and light. These factors are considered to be the main contributors to degradation under field condition. Solar PV modules were tested by monitoring and recording power output of the panel under varying temperature and humidity. After 4 years, the test",22,186,0.5721925133689839,7.824614938160297,0.8932769660729453,0.04697644132407527,0.8685714285714285,0.8652760736196308,0.816117615044371,53.067889224279014,65.475935828877,62.2967032967033

Cowpeas [ Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] grown during summer and winter seasons at two locations in North-west Himalayas were evaluated for physicochemical, functional and sensory properties. Cowpeaseeds were harvested from the plots at 50% seed development and 100% pod maturity stages for each season, dried at ambient temperature and ground in to 0.25mm size fraction using a hammer mill. Seed samples were analyzed for proximate composition, mineral content, protein, free amino acid and fat content and the results revealed that the seed protein content was high in both seasons. The seed fat and ash content were found high during the winter season. In general, the moisture content of both cow peaseed varieties was found very low.

We use panel data for the period of 1962 to 2010. The results indicate that climate-driven changes in temperature and rainfall have a negative impact, on average, while the impact of climate on food production is mixed. Climate change has not had a significant impact... on inflation. A significant reduction in food inflation and an increase in the real value of agricultural prices are found as the main impacts on the Indian economy from climate changes.

Indian climate,The impact of climate change on Indian agriculture,"The impact of climate change on Indian agriculture
The Indian agricultural sector contributes to a significant portion of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP), and also provides livelihood to over half of India’ s population.
It has been estimated that the average growth rate of agriculture in India is around 3% per annum. However, agriculture is extremely weather sensitive. The agricultural growth in the last three decades has largely been driven by increased input use and improved technology. This trend may, however, not continue in future as the Indian cropland is already approaching its optimum carrying capacity for arable lands – estimated at 160 million hectares in 2004. As a result, agricultural productivity is expected to remain flat or decline in coming decades. Climate change will only aggravate the situation further as extreme events, such as droughts or heavy floods, will become more frequent. In fact, recent studies have shown that 70% of Indian districts have been affected, to some extent, by floods in last two decades, and",32,198,0.6237113402061856,8.687293719274631,0.9103871821881921,0.03916983567214144,0.9257142857142856,0.9265882352941158,0.8378472231471805,97.02937613567535,99.8917525773196,111.76453634085213

Abstract. Roof area constitutes a major proportion in the built environment and the roof plays a vital role in protecting the building and also in regulating the internal thermal comfort of the buildings, thus affecting the indoor climate. In the present study, the effect of using cool roofs to reduce the heat transfer into and from the structure, was investigated using a calibrated simulation tool developed based on a simplified energy model. The study was carried out using the calibrated cooling simulation model and validated it with the actual data of a typical building of India. Results obtained from this validated model were found to be in excellent agreement with field data. This model can be used for assessing the energy efficiency of buildings with different climatic conditions and can serve as an important tool for decision making of selecting the suitable materials for the roofs in different parts",33,187,0.5276381909547738,7.443252652587526,0.8792163882985435,0.0525408139132116,0.857142857142857,0.839085714285713,0.7794998619041953,53.745466321243526,52.17085427135678,45.33103448275862

In the past few decades, the Indian subcontinent has witnessed a significant increase in mean annual temperatures and precipitation, with the latter being the major driving force behind the changes. The impact of these climate changes is evident from an increase of about 5% in the mean crop productivity of wheat, rice, and sorghum, 7.9% for sugarcane, but a decline of 1.3% and 12% respectively for cotton and jute, between the years 1986–87 and the year 2001–02 (BISP 2012).

Abstract
The main purpose of this research work is the design of radiant cooled and/or evaporatively cooled buildings for various climatic conditions. For this purpose, the performance of a radiant and evaporated cooled building has been studied in four different climatic regions of India. The climatic data of these locations has used to predict the thermal performance for four typical building envelope and climate conditions for the purpose. A two dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation has applied for each of the building types. In addition to this, a three dimensional 3D CFD model has developed for an office building in a hot and humid region and an experimental study has also been carried out in an evaporating cooled office room for verification of simulation model results. It is observed that the radiant system has better",42,184,0.5355191256830601,7.244368455354814,0.8801189491922892,0.05298724527211533,0.88,0.8784905660377356,0.7974651938169159,62.794117647058826,60.91803278688525,55.36416666666666
Indian climate,Climate change and Indian forests,"Climate change and Indian forests
The forests of India play a key role in combating climate change by capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, storing carbon and releasing oxygen.
India’s forests absorb approximately one-fourth of the country’ s greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) per year. Forests in India sequester 2.2 billion tonnes carbon per annum – an amount of carbon 50 times greater than anthropogenic emissions into the Indian atmosphere per day. In the past decade alone, Indian rainforests have sequestered over 200 Mt of greenhouse gases. This is an area of about the size of Belgium. The carbon stored in the forest is equivalent in weight and mass to that present in 5.6 lakh cars, and 8 per cent of total global greenhouse emissions from all man-made sources. Indian forestry and agriculture can therefore be considered the largest carbon sinks on Earth. A large majority of these sinks are found in tropical forests, but India’",43,192,0.5875706214689266,7.81711869122942,0.8972674940050391,0.04570005681661267,0.897142857142857,0.9121568627450977,0.8106880494407276,84.69845360824742,70.45197740112994,75.63235871271586

Abstract
Climate change is considered by most governments to be one of the most pressing issues facing the world. Climate change policy involves a number of complex issues, with the interaction and coordination of international and national governments as well as state governments, and with a range of other sectors and stakeholders. This paper examines the climate policy process in Australia and the USA (which have similar policy frameworks for climate change) and India - a developing country and one that is not party to the Paris Agreement. The research is exploratory in nature, using a qualitative method based on the analysis of documents and semi structured interviews. It examines how the processes involved in the development and implementation of climate policies in these contexts are different.

Abstract. Indian rainfall is a highly complex hydrological phenomenon, influenced by various natural and anthropogenic factors. The Indian summer monsoons are highly variable, and the variability is influenced primarily by large scale atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections over the tropics. These are the primary drivers of the Indian Monsoon. A number of climate model simulations have been made to study the influence of external forcing such as greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol radiative forcing on the hydrology of India. In this paper, we compare observed data and simulated rainfall over 1951–1996 for the 16 CM1 climate simulations from the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4). We have also performed statistical tests for these simulations. We find that, except for some of these CM simulations, all CM IP5 simulations do not reproduce",45,190,0.6091954022988506,8.035839261936376,0.9039327597093368,0.042876647484673444,0.8866666666666666,0.8653333333333318,0.8196100963085479,65.77035292822718,74.05747126436782,64.31788048552754
Indian climate,Impact of climate change in Indian horticulture-a review,"Impact of climate change in Indian horticulture-a review
AbstractThis review paper focuses on the effects of various kinds of climatic changes on horticultural crops and the possible strategies available to combat such changes. The climate of India is generally characterized by a wide variability in temperature and precipitation, resulting in wide range of agro-climatic conditions. In addition, the country is also experiencing a rise in temperatures and an increase in the frequency of extreme weather events. Climate changes, particularly the increase of temperature, have a strong effect on crop development, which in turn affects the crop growth parameters. Climatic changes can influence the productivity of crops by either increasing or decreasing their growth potential. This review also discusses various adaptation strategies such as changing cultivars, changing growing practices, shifting the cropping seasons and developing new crop varieties that can withstand the adverse impacts of changing climate.

Abstract
The Green revolution in the Indian subcontinent has often been viewed as an example of a technology-led agricultural productivity growth that has been beneficial to climate change. However, the evidence is mixed, with both positive and negative effects on Indian climate. This study examines the climate impact of the green revolution (1974–1989) using an integrated assessment model [the IMAGE model, IMAGES). We find that a 10% increase in agricultural area leads to 0.1%–0.4% decline in annual average temperature, and a decline of up to approximately 1.5% in precipitation, for the period from 2001 to the end of 2100 compared to a base scenario. The results are sensitive to assumptions about crop yields, fertilizer use, land use and land cover change, as well as climate response to changes in land",47,185,0.5697674418604651,7.472429946297629,0.8907182900969111,0.048884061419240975,0.8266666666666667,0.8589189189189197,0.8070010147172356,48.90856844305121,56.866279069767444,60.01533166458073

The precipitation of different rain drop sizes can impact climate in many ways. However, the current global precipitation datasets only contain a limited set of data for rain drops with diameters smaller than 0.2 mm – a major gap in data coverage. This study investigates the impact of precipitation with smaller drops on climate and assesses uncertainties in the global and regional precipitation estimates by using a global meteorological model [model meteorology 4] with 20 rain-drop size subdomains, and compares the results to observations and reanalyses. In the study, we focus on the Indian summer monsoon ([July",52,180,0.5933333333333334,7.266819570256762,0.8958218082686725,0.04787399944639076,0.9266666666666666,0.9060317460317457,0.8202539312022974,78.69584002198215,73.19333333333333,69.94047619047619

Indian climate,Possible impacts of Indian Ocean dipole mode events on global climate,"Possible impacts of Indian Ocean dipole mode events on global climate variability: A review
The Indian–Ocean Dipole is a natural phenomenon occurring in the Indian and Pacific oceans and its impacts on tropical climate and weather have been the subject of much scrutiny. This phenomenon is characterised by an alternation of warm and cool conditions in both the northern and southern oceans which can have significant impacts in other climatic regions of the planet. The dipoles are thought to have a strong link to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and are therefore often used as a proxy for the strength of tropical ENSO activity. It is important to understand the impact that IOD events have on climate as it is believed that these events can influence global surface temperatures for up to several years following the original events. In this review, we summarise the most recent research on the IMD and attempt to quantify the impacts that this event can cause on different atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.",54,183,0.5580110497237569,7.50727087709638,0.8877797734776209,0.049706024485297436,0.8971428571428571,0.8899363057324841,0.7972630225866107,64.39007526281452,66.32596685082873,68.13518299881937

Abstract
Australia is the world’s largest coal producer, with exports totalling more than one-fifth of world exports. In 2014, Australia was the largest exporter of coal globally and the third-largest exporter in 2002. Australia is also one of the highest emitters of carbon dioxide in the industrialised world (IPCC, 1993). Australia has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The Australian Government has a number of international obligations to limit its greenhouse gas emissions in order to help curb climate change. This includes a commitment to reduce greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below ‘business-as-usual’ levels by the year 2020. It is expected that the current Australian emissions profile will be in excess of 50 million tons of CO2-eq [1] by that date. However, there is some disagreement as to the best approach towards achieving that target. One approach has been to",55,196,0.6,8.270429251254134,0.902644695976084,0.04272304999680891,0.8514285714285714,0.8669879518072283,0.8228263652091744,66.14323695579927,71.30526315789474,61.305788590604024

The Indian climate is very diverse, from the tropical monsoonal forests of the Eastern Ghats to the snow-clad mountain ranges.
These forests are also highly sensitive to climate variability and climate extremes. In the future, forests will face increasing threats from changing climate, including:
- Droughts and fires
Drought is a natural phenomenon in the dryland areas of India and is exacerbated by climate. Increasingly severe droughts, and the associated heat waves, will threaten forests and forest resources. The forests may also be susceptible to fire, as climate and temperature extremes increase and cause an increase in fire intensity. This could threaten forest ecosystems, the wildlife and human livelihoods that rely on them. It could also increase the spread of invasive and non-native plants and animals.",56,183,0.5159235668789809,6.464503764187739,0.8691130383780303,0.05960516523529064,0.8533333333333334,0.8622556390977448,0.7392634918130532,49.77799479166667,50.37579617834395,47.05246422893482

Indian climate,Indian agriculture and climate sensitivity,"Indian agriculture and climate sensitivity : an empirical approach
The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of climate change on the agricultural sector of India by estimating the relationship between rainfall and its components. We use an error correction and cointegration methodology to identify the long-term equilibrium relationship for the variables and also to check the existence of a long run relationship. The empirical results indicate that rainfall is a leading indicator of agricultural activity in India. This implies that agricultural development in the country is highly dependent on rainfall variability. Our analysis also indicates that India’s agricultural economy is not very climate sensitive. In this case, climate is an input for production of food in agriculture rather than being a major factor for determining its productivity. Thus, the impacts of projected climate changes would have little direct effect on agricultural production.

Excerpt
Climate change and its impacts have been identified as two of the biggest risks facing agriculture in the 21st century. This study, funded by the European Science Foundation in partnership with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, aims to assess climate-related risks to agriculture through the lens of air quality and greenhouse gas fluxes. The study was conducted over a period of two years in collaboration with Indian partners. Results have shown that there is strong spatial variation in agricultural productivity, with productivity declining by 10-30% by mid-century for most crops in most locations, particularly for maize and wheat.

A team of researchers from the Tata Energy Research Institute, the Indian Institute of Technology (Madras) and the International Crops Research Center in the Dry Tropics of India conducted field investigations in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. They examined how farmers in all five regions have managed to adapt to the consequences of climate variability and change, with special emphasis on agricultural practices. Their findings indicate there are multiple cost-effectiveness opportunities available to farmers who wish to make the switch from water-intensive rice cultivation. These include growing more crops in drier regions, switching from conventional rice to drought-tolerant varieties, growing millets, using organic practices, shifting to low-cost solar irrigation,",62,180,0.6187845303867403,8.324894437968263,0.9076659740144446,0.040897773054742965,0.8742857142857142,0.8761783439490446,0.8202684877438028,65.11824398316016,72.42541436464089,76.2400654511454

The data set was constructed to capture farmers’ perceptions of temperature, rainfall patterns, crop performance, farm management, fertilizer use, pesticide use and knowledge about climate. In a first step, the data were used to construct a set of variables that captured farmers' knowledge and perceptions about changing temperature and precipitation. Then, these variables were combined to create measures of passive climate adaptation that we use as explanatory variables in a second step. Our results suggest that farmers are actively adjusting their agricultural practices to adapt to higher temperatures. However, they are passive when it comes to changing their knowledge. We argue that the reason for this may be that they do not have enough scientific and technical knowledge to be",63,184,0.4896907216494845,6.8206025068685125,0.8644645991019357,0.059242634151779355,0.8914285714285715,0.9042352941176457,0.7772143994746459,58.19115861367162,60.16494845360825,55.57847394540943

Abstract
The experimental investigation and analysis of solar energy thermal cooker (SET) was made by using a paraboloid dish solar collector and phase-change thermal energy storage [TCS] unit. The solar radiation was absorbed by the parabola dish & concentrated to a small area with the aid of lens. Solar radiation is absorbed 70% by parabasol dish with a 5% efficiency. Thermal energy from the absorbed solar was stored in the TCS and the energy was released to the cooker when necessary. A mathematical model was developed for SET and its simulation was performed using Matlab. In the present study SET with Tcs has a capacity of 1 kW to supply 50 kW/h energy. This energy is equivalent to 40% of the cooking energy consumed in daily life in urban and rural areas of India. It is found that the efficiency",65,183,0.5135135135135135,6.984538909891174,0.8723307460621644,0.056312123311349355,0.9142857142857143,0.8770186335403728,0.7795968931022295,55.53921568627451,58.513513513513516,50.156860902255644

Abstract
The Indian subcontinent is a very important region for the global climate system, as it is situated in a region of intense monsoonal precipitation and also plays a key role for global food security. India’s vulnerability to climate change is therefore high. In addition, the region is very vulnerable to the effects of climate changes. Climate change affects all sectors of the economy, but agriculture is the most affected and has to adapt in many different ways. This paper discusses the impacts of changing climatic conditions on Indian agricultural yields, crop production and the Indian farmer, with a brief review of past research and a detailed analysis of present and future projections. The analysis shows that the changes in temperature, precipitation, and evaporation are expected to have strong effects on crop yield, water management, pest management and irrigation scheduling. Furthermore, there is an urgent need for adaptation measures, such as improved crop varieties, diversification",67,181,0.5263157894736842,7.2547625011001164,0.8776727765405299,0.05368163693008349,0.8457142857142858,0.8556626506024091,0.7742365813618396,57.118089630356565,52.810526315789474,48.411742424242426

Abstract
This paper examines the coverage of climate issues in three Indian languages (English, Hindi, and Malayalam), focusing on climate science and political issues of the Kyoto Protocol. This study explores how the media in each of these languages presents the issue of global climate in a manner that reflects the cultural and ideological background of each nation. The analysis reveals significant differences between the way these issues are addressed and framed in these three languages. While English has the least amount of coverage, this is due in large part to the fact that this coverage is often in specialized magazines. In addition, there are significant discrepancies in how climate is framed and discussed in Hindi and English. Finally, a comparison of how issues such as climate are discussed across all three newspapers reveals that Malayali newspapers are more likely to discuss the political dimensions of this issue than the Hindi or English newspapers.

Indian climate,India and climate change: Evolving ideas and increasing policy engagement,"India and climate change: Evolving ideas and increasing policy engagement
This paper presents a study of India’s response to climate policy since it first entered discussions at the UN climate negotiations over a decade ago. The findings of this review suggest that India has become increasingly engaged in the climate regime, both by contributing to global climate efforts and by drawing on international climate knowledge to inform its domestic climate policies. India remains, however, a highly vulnerable country which will continue to face significant challenges in adapting to the effects of climate variability and change. In order to address these challenges, the paper argues for a stronger focus on developing and deploying climate-resilient agricultural policies and technologies, as well as on enhancing India's climate monitoring capacity, including through regional cooperation. Finally, this paper highlights that the country has yet to formulate climate adaptation strategies, which are needed to ensure that its development objectives are aligned with a changing climate.",71,186,0.5955056179775281,7.945035903356131,0.8999679451777178,0.04445039357970997,0.8914285714285713,0.8953246753246751,0.8055377151330881,85.17697594501718,76.30337078651685,74.96792668957617

© 2017, Springer Nature. River water is a vital resource for human survival. However, the impacts of climate change on river flows have received very scant attention. Here we review recent studies on the hydrological response in Indian subcontinent, and discuss the key drivers affecting the climate sensitivity and the magnitude of the changes in river flow in India. The studies reviewed show a wide range of hydrologic responses from climate extremes, such as floods, droughts, heatwaves, heavy rainfall, etc. We found that the change in hydrologeographic features in the river basin (e.g. change of basin extent, basin water storage capacity, change to hydromorphological features, land-use changes, changes to channel morphology and vegetation) and changes of key",72,189,0.5536723163841808,7.366131074427723,0.8857872580109284,0.05080698409457388,0.8228571428571428,0.8135947712418313,0.7673315072541589,46.37588967971531,39.847457627118644,39.53169548074007

A new study led by a scientist at the University of Exeter and published in Scientific Reports demonstrates how the Indian Ocean influences regional climate changes in the North Pacific, which are projected to intensify in coming decades due to human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.
The study, led Dr. Andrew King at University College London, is the first to examine in detail the relationship between the climate of the tropical Pacific and changes occurring in its eastern region. The study uses the state-of-the-art ocean and sea surface temperature models to understand the mechanisms by which changes over the eastern tropical Indian ocean influence regional changes. These mechanisms include: changes of ocean-atmosphere interaction and the influence of sea-air-ocean feedbacks in both the atmosphere and ocean. They have been able to simulate changes and future warming of up to 2 degrees Celsius in this region as a result of climate model changes alone, highlighting the potential magnitude of",73,190,0.5130890052356021,7.091031131865732,0.872949122219588,0.05569882475402382,0.8514285714285714,0.8534131736526943,0.7706116366379946,54.411129123552236,55.27748691099477,46.952719180587735

[1] This study investigates the intensifications of the tropical circulation that occur on time scales of a few years, by comparing two tropical cyclone seasons (1985 and 1991). It is found that these intensifiers – defined here as the ratio of maximum cycloon-monthly precipitation to minimum monthly precipitation — are associated with a shift in atmospheric circulation to the east and north, and are linked with an intensified subtropical anticyclone (<5°S). A similar circulation shift, with associated intensifier, is seen in a 1983–1984 climate season.",74,192,0.6551724137931034,7.056422850727971,0.9110447401184962,0.04308891745228247,0.91,0.91,0.8345839464657843,81.08254775799293,76.37068965517241,72.6260593220339

A recent study of the agricultural sector in India by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows that the sector is very vulnerable, and that climate-related hazards such as extreme drought, heavy rain and extreme heat events have led to crop damage, livestock deaths, water shortages for irrigation and increased water logging.
The study shows, for example, that more than 50 percent of India’s agricultural output depends on rainfed agriculture. The study notes that while climate projections are uncertain, it expects that crop yields and livestock productivity will decrease in the future in most parts of southern India, northern India and western India. And that in all these regions, the frequency and extent — and, in some cases, intensity – of extreme events will be expected to increase. This will lead to a decline in crop production. It will also cause water stress, which could reduce productivity and increase the risk of crop failure and crop loss.

Abstract
The Indian subcontinents is home to a great diversity of species, both flora and fauna, and has been called the “epicurean paradise” due to its rich biodiversity. This biodiversity has contributed to the development of sustainable practices that have been passed down the generations from generation to generation for over 5,000 years. The climate in this part of the world is highly variable, ranging from extreme heat in the summer months to extreme cold in winter months – this is what makes the subcontinent a place of great climatic diversity. Due to this climatic variation the agricultural practices of this region must adapt to these varying climates. One such practice that has adapted to changes in temperature and precipitation over the last 50 years is cultivation of mustard, Brassica jun",76,187,0.5459770114942529,7.201931413999582,0.882695886646897,0.05235507027708387,0.8266666666666667,0.8349333333333326,0.7906761850784323,58.0,54.14367816091954,48.0851088027902

The monosols of India are characterized by the fact that the soil temperature, at about 5 cm below the surface, fluctuates in a narrow range, and this range is much less than in other soils. The Indian rainfall is highly seasonal. A monomodal distribution is typical, with a maximum during the north-east mon-soon, a secondary maximum in the south-west moni-son and a small residual in between.

Abstract
Climate has been identified as a major threat to agricultural production, especially in developing countries. The Indian subcontinent is the most affected by global climate change, particularly, the increase in temperature, which is predicted to rise up to 2.0-3.5 degrees C in the next 20-50 years, causing an increase of 5%-10% in global mean temperature by the year 2100. Climate change can cause a decrease in agricultural output by reducing yields, reducing the quality of produce and/or increasing input requirements. In this study, we investigate the impact of climate changes on three major crops in Indian Agriculture - maize (corn), wheat & rice.

Abstract
Climate change is the biggest global challenge of this century, and it is affecting India and its agricultural activities. Rice is one of the major cereals, which is being cultivated and consumed across India. The study aims to assess the regional level vulnerability analysis of climate variability and change for rice crop in three major growing regions of India (north, east and western regions). The assessment considers 14 climate variables – mean temperature, maximum temperature; minimum temperature and relative humidity. A multi-criteria decision analysis - 2000 decision support framework was used to analyse the vulnerability. In the first stage analysis, the relative importance of variables is determined and the most crucial variable identified. This is then used for developing the weighting factors in the second stage. Finally, in a ‘bottom-up approach’, the overall regional rice vulnerability index is calculated by combining the weighted variables from the two",80,198,0.5353535353535354,7.533091977898236,0.8818463717970751,0.05144573475660602,0.8685714285714285,0.8503448275862072,0.7856245946440953,56.95548417923126,53.64646464646464,52.475

Abstract
The energy saving of evaporatively cooled buildings with indirect evaporation cooling system is analyzed. In the present paper, the energy analysis of conventional and improved indirect cooling (IC) system was performed. The analysis is performed in the Indian cities of Jaipur and Delhi. For the conventional system, 20 and 30% of energy savings are obtained for winter and summer conditions respectively. It is also found that the improved IC with 50% reduction in water flow rate and with the same evaporating water temperature is more energy efficient than the existing system. Moreover, it is found from the analysis that 15-20% energy reduction may be achieved if the system operates with evaporator temperature of 27°C as compared to 32°c.

Indian climate,Future climate change: Implications for Indian summer monsoon and its variability,"Future climate change: Implications for Indian summer monsoon and its variability
Abstract
The current study examines future climatic trends in the summer Indian monsoons. The study is carried out by using a coupled general circulation model (GCM) with the atmospheric component driven by a 20 year control 1961-80 simulation. Two scenarios of future climate have been considered in this study, the first scenario represents an idealistic scenario and the second represents a realistic scenario. It is observed that in both scenarios the Indian Summer Monsoon will be affected. However, there is considerable difference in their intensity, and their impacts. Under the ideal scenario, both the intensity and frequency of the mon Soons decrease. Whereas, under the realistic scenarios, intensity of summer rainfall is predicted to increase and monSoons will become more frequent and intense. These findings indicate that the changes in summer climate will result in changes to the seasonal mon soons, leading to a significant impact on agriculture, water resources management, energy demand and supply and other human activities in Asia.

This study is an examination of the barriers and challenges to effective climate adaptation by tribal governments in the United States of America.
Abstract:
The climate crisis is real. It is happening as we speak. In the next thirty years, the climate is expected to warm by 2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit in many parts of North America, with the most dramatic temperature increases projected for the far northern reaches of Alaska, Canada, and the Arctic. As this climate shifts, communities in these areas will be impacted by rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns. These changes will have impacts on the economy and environment. Climate adaptation is necessary for communities to survive and thrive into the future. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reports that adaptation will likely be more cost effective than mitigation, particularly for rural communities. However, there are barriers that prevent some tribes and indigenous communities from adapting to climate changes. This study will address two main questions.

This book is a unique compilation of research contributions on various topics related to climate variability and change, and the impacts of climate change on water resources of the world. Climate change has a strong impact on hydrological regimes, which in turn are responsible for a large extent of global food security. The book will provide a comprehensive overview of recent research and future scenarios related with climate and climate-hydrology interactions and how these affect agriculture, water and food resources.
The first five chapters in the book deal with the impact of changing climate on river flow and its management. Chapters 6 and 7 deal respectively with changes in climate, rainfall and streamflow in South Asia and their impact. Chapter 8 deals with impact, management and adaptation to changing rainfall-runoff regime. This is followed by chapters 13–17 on impact and management of salinity on crops, livestock and aquaculture.

Abstract
This paper presents a study that analyses the climate and environmental risk perception, knowledge and practices of small scale farmers in Himachal Pradesh, one of the states in the western Himalaya of India. The survey was conducted from January to September 2016. A total of 120 farmers (60 from the hill and 60 low land areas) were interviewed. In this study, it was found that farmers were aware that climate is changing but they didn’t have the perception of change of their own environment. This perception was significantly different among different categories of farmers. Hill farmers perceived climate to be changing, whereas lowland farmers did not show any change in their environment and thought of themselves as ‘climate resilient’. The results showed that low-land farmer perceived risk of water, soil erosion and pests as greater than the high-landers. There are several factors that contribute to",86,180,0.5159574468085106,7.074452087647886,0.8736296536801593,0.05556797491465093,0.8514285714285714,0.8636585365853665,0.7766986814174117,49.59723560492337,55.83510638297872,51.277455357142856

South Asia is characterized by large interannual variability in the precipitation regime and by high latitudes. In this contribution, I show that this high variability can be explained by two different mechanisms: First, the annual monsoon circulation has been affected by the western branch of South Asian monsoons which have a more pronounced influence in this region because of their origin in Western Tropical Pacific, where the sea surface temperature and the monoswell amplitude are the highest in that region. The second mechanism is due to the interaction of this westerlies with the South India low, which is located in a narrow band in northern India. It is found that during the winter monomonsol, this interaction creates a region of high pressure in peninuslar India, called the Peninsulat India high,",94,182,0.5524861878453039,7.432941462471663,0.8858656950827842,0.050553832679139876,0.88,0.8822929936305731,0.786401106423206,61.246287855147415,65.13259668508287,68.75697704747

Introduction
The Asian summer monsoon, also known as the South Asian or Indo-Pacific summer circulation (ISSC), is one of Earth's great natural systems that has a profound impact on the hydrological, atmospheric and oceanic climate of Asia. It has the largest precipitation and circulation in the world, transporting ~40% of annual global rainfall to and from the IndoPac – and, in doing so, provides the basis of support for a vast population of >1 billion people () (). This monsoonscale circulation has two main branches, the Asian monSOuth-EastErn Branch ((AME; Fig. 2, a) and the Western Pacific Branch of monSon (), Figs. b and c)).

Impact Of Climate Change On Agriculture
Agricultural production has a strong dependence on climate and weather. Climate and climate variability are the main drivers of crop production and productivity in the country, as well as of food availability in its food supply chain, and of the rural population’s livelihood. A changing climate will have major ramifications for agriculture, including crop yields, agricultural production systems, food prices, rural incomes and the ability of rural communities to feed themselves.
The impact is likely to vary by region and sector with the intensity of vulnerability and adaptive capacity being a determining factor. The most vulnerable states include Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh as per the Climate Impact Index (CII), a measure that assesses vulnerability based on a combination of exposure to climate risk and ability to cope with that risk. These regions also have the largest populations and highest levels of agricultural productivity. It is expected that in these regions",99,186,0.5,6.92820323027551,0.8681601919712955,0.05774087377142206,0.84,0.8476190476190479,0.7763173301964525,57.259883344134806,54.760416666666664,54.322550640760646

Abstract. In this paper a set of experiments is undertaken to investigate the ability of regional atmospheric climate modelling to reproduce the seasonal cycle of the monsoonal precipitation in India. This is accomplished by comparing the simulations of a high-resolution model with an output of precipitation fields with a climatological analysis. The simulations, carried out with the Regional Climate Model (RegCM), use the data from a global climate model – the NCAR-FNL 3.1 - and the regional analysis data. It is found that RegCM is able to simulate the annual cycle and to some extent the interannual variability of mon so nal precipitation, but its performance is limited by the overestimation of both the precipitation amount and of its inter-annual variabil ity.

Abstract
Climate change is a global phenomenon with local impacts. The state is the key institution that can address this problem, but it also plays a key role in creating, exacerbating and managing its impacts and risks. This article addresses the emergence in recent decades of a ‘climate institution’ in New Delhi, India’s political capital. It is shown that this process of institutional emergence is not the product of an unproblematic and linear process, as is usually assumed in institutionalism; rather, it is fraught with difficulties and ambiguities, and it was achieved through the negotiation and contestation of multiple, often conflicting, visions and interests. We argue that the climate institution is, in a way, the (unintended) outcome of the particular way in which climate change has been understood in the Indian political context. Its uneven and ambiguous emergence, we argue, is due in large",103,199,0.517948717948718,7.2327602277982725,0.8752362797652729,0.054481150466322244,0.8457142857142858,0.8563742690058481,0.765695492723418,54.026029373196955,52.14358974358974,48.91344630978777

The global concern about climate change has been growing and it is now widely accepted, that it poses an unprecedented challenge to humanity. The climate of India, too, is changing and the Indian government has recognised the need to take action.
At COP-15, the government of the United States was a major obstacle to the agreement that the majority of nations desired and that would have been in keeping with the scientific reality. At the same time, it was heartening to witness that China and Brazil, two of our main trading partners and neighbours, took a leading role at COP 15. Their participation was significant because they were the world's two largest emitting nations. They took the lead in negotiating a deal. Both countries pledged to reduce their emission by at least 40% by 2020 and to peak emissions by mid-century.

Abstract
The Indian Hindu Kush–Himalayas – the highest mountain range in Asia and the third most important mountain system on the planet - is the centre of the largest contiguous mountain region in Earth’s cryosphere. As such, the Himalayas are an important indicator of global changes and are a major source of water for Asia’ and its people. The region has a very complex and dynamic climate that controls and shapes the hydrological cycle through the large amount of snowpack and permafrost",106,192,0.5849056603773585,7.37537974717874,0.8941971109195418,0.04806170041360367,0.8533333333333334,0.8370370370370369,0.7785132875916585,61.850632999930056,63.0251572327044,59.1469764837626

ABSTRACT
The paper provides an estimate of the potential impact (both positive and negative) of recent Indian climate conditions and climate projections on major food crops. This is done by applying a stochastic simulation technique to estimate the yields and yields variability of major crops in India under current climate and projected climate scenarios. We find that a significant reduction in mean and range of crop yield is possible by the end of this century, due to climate warming in the future. However, the magnitude of impact depends strongly on the climate model used for projection. The impacts vary from crop, region, climate scenario, and model. For example, for wheat, yield decrease due temperature increase is highest in models with high temperature sensitivity, while it is very low in other models. Further, temperature and yield",107,180,0.5210526315789473,7.182214876089116,0.8757573411022161,0.05452219969979796,0.8514285714285714,0.843614457831325,0.7758810595285559,42.75,54.3421052631579,50.16313468158347

Abstract. Evaporation - a key component of surface water, and an important part of water resources, has a large impact on the hydrological system. In this study, we used the Community Climate System Model version 4. We performed three experiments of simulations: one without the effect of climate variability and change; second with climate changes as projected by the fifth IPCC’s report; the third one with the effects of both climate variation and climate warming. The study was carried out in the period of 2001–2100 for 21 Indian stations. Our results showed that the evaporation has increased in 70 % of stations in all experiments, but increased at higher rates in case of IP5 scenario (+ 6.4 mm yr- −1 ) and",108,187,0.6337209302325582,8.311172083126955,0.911384733555521,0.039639516360018744,0.8933333333333332,0.8737837837837843,0.8306578528060006,90.4704743624852,83.44186046511628,66.5167493796526

This study examines the impacts of heat stress on the health and economic outcomes of urban residents in India. Using data from the India Meteorological Department, the study finds that the frequency of extreme heat events has increased substantially in both urban and rural areas of the country in recent decades. In 2020 alone, 14 Indian states experienced a heat wave, which resulted in more than 2000 deaths.
The study estimates that heat-related health impacts have a significant negative effect on Indian economic welfare. The average daily GDP loss due to extreme weather-triggered heatwaves in 2019 is estimated to be more or less equivalent to the total annual health expenditure of an average Indian household. This estimate is even more significant for vulnerable populations such as women, elderly, low-income and low education groups, as they tend to bear a higher health burden.

Abstract
Water is one of the most essential resources required by the world, especially the developing countries like India. The sustainable management and utilisation of water is a major issue globally. In the last decade, groundwater has been the focus of attention in terms of its availability, quality, quantity and sustainability. It is estimated that India has over 30% of world’s population, yet the country has only 6% freshwater.

The Indian Himalayas is a region that is extremely sensitive to climatic variations. The mountain glaciers, the cryospheric components, have been declining in number and area since the beginning of 20th century. This is because of the anthropogenic activities, like deforestation, forest fragmentation, mining, construction and other anthropocene stressors. There is no dearth of literature on the impacts of climate change in Himalayan regions. What is more worrisome is that the glaciers in high altitudes are declining at an alarming rate, causing floods and landslides in lower regions, affecting lives, livelihoods and property. In addition to this, it is also affecting the agriculture of these regions in a negative way due to climate variability and change. Thus there is need for urgent action to save the Himalaya and its cryogenic components.",111,192,0.5625,7.115124735378853,0.8866316374866752,0.051434751014197526,0.8533333333333334,0.8588235294117643,0.753238087653732,60.18565941101153,55.8875,56.92290660225443

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between job satisfaction, organizational commitment and effectiveness for the first time in India. A sample of 1000 respondents drawn from 30 different industries, from different levels, and from both manufacturing and service sectors, completed a questionnaire which included measures of job satisfactions, commitment, effectiveness, leadership and management style. The results indicated that a significant and strong positive relationship existed between all the variables except between leadership style and job performance. It was also observed that the dimensions of climate, namely, communication, role clarity, reward and performance, had a higher effect on overall job effectiveness than leadership or the management",112,182,0.5919540229885057,7.808409848862705,0.8983677668536093,0.04536041027631624,0.86,0.8634666666666673,0.8017415241039039,61.13987092079057,64.33908045977012,52.4277318640955

Abstract
Indian sub continent has the highest concentration of river systems and its river water is used extensively for irrigation, drinking water supply and power generation purposes. Climate change is expected to have significant impact on river system, which may alter the water availability at different scales. Hydrological sensitivity is a key measure which assesses the response of hydrology to a climate variable. In this study, hydrological and meteorological data was used to identify the most sensitive Indian River Basin to rainfall changes, and the findings were compared with other basINSIGHTS articles. The analysis revealed a wide distribution of water-sensitive basInsights regions in all river basin. However, most of the regions were water sensitive to both rainfall and temperature. It is evident that hydrologically sensitive regions are more prone to the changes in rainfall than temperature, but a region’s hydraulically and thermally-induced sensitivity to water changes are highly inter-connected across different basRiver basINg",115,196,0.5368421052631579,7.399857751122119,0.8814468448550337,0.05202543842186139,0.9085714285714285,0.8973493975903614,0.7971350185831235,63.333333333333336,63.2,59.713239436619716

Abstract. A long-term (~ 50 000 yrs BP) Indian-Ocean based climate model was used to understand the linkages between the summer Indian monsoons and Northern Hemisphere climate. The model is coupled to a 5° resolution ocean general circulation and sea surface temperature (SST) model, forced by the observed atmospheric circulation of the Northern-Hemisphere summer – the ECHAM5/MPI-OM and ECE-MRI coupled runs. It has been observed that the Indian summer-monsoon is more efficient in transporting heat from the tropics towards the higher latitudes during inter-glacials. During glacial conditions, the heat transported is lower. In contrast, during glacia-interglacia transitions, a similar trend of heat transport can be seen for both the interglacial and glaciations.",119,200,0.5777777777777777,7.751702321999271,0.8943634681549878,0.04683980831849556,0.8514285714285714,0.8617948717948719,0.8004641923534529,70.36843911927684,60.388888888888886,57.741934536052185

Abstract
The paper presents an assessment of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions associated with food consumption in India, based on an analysis of the current state of affairs and projected future trends in food supply, consumption, and production, with a focus on the food-energy-water nexus. Food consumption patterns and the associated GHG emissions are analysed for 2002 and 2050, using a bottom-up life cycle assessment [LCA] approach and a multi-regional input-output modelling framework. Emissions are estimated in terms of their direct emissions – emissions directly associated to the crop production -- and indirect emissions, which include the emissions caused by the generation of electricity, cooking fuel and refrigeration for food preservation. The results suggest that food is the biggest source of GHGs associated food in the country, accounting for almost 50%, followed by animal products (~20 %), and other",122,191,0.578125,8.010734985006058,0.8957744834867823,0.045646853425641336,0.8685714285714285,0.8659523809523807,0.800968186037397,67.82337799776218,63.59375,56.93747189748201

Abstract/Description
An experimental study of the genetic effects on head growth and shape variation was conducted in a tropical rice population. The effects of maternal and paternal environments are shown to act independently but in different ways, with the maternal factor being dominant. These effects, which are expressed mainly at the level of head length, can be explained by a maternal-mediated interaction between the two parents.

A new book by a group of Indian researchers explores what is being done to improve the climate resilience of India’s 400 largest cities.
The Indian urban system is changing rapidly, with more than a quarter of the Indian population now living in cities that have over a million inhabitants. These rapidly growing cities are also more densely populated than any other, and the majority are located in the ‘sunbelt’, an area extending from Mumbai in western India across to New Delhi in north India. As such, they are among the most vulnerable to climate change. The Indian government has acknowledged this vulnerability and in its latest Five-Year Plan, 2020-2025, it has pledged a total of around $30 billion in support of climate action. However, in order to achieve the ambitious climate targets that India has committed to, much more action is needed. And it is this challenge that lies behind the work of researchers at the",127,190,0.5515463917525774,7.6821522972097975,0.8870453025433731,0.04937259028127049,0.8628571428571429,0.8861176470588228,0.8013130285530564,72.3626455906822,67.80412371134021,72.57762324739937

Abstract. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report [IPCCC, Fourth Assessment, AR4] was published in 2007 using simulations of the twentieth century based on the HadGCRN1 climate dataset. This dataset contains daily data from 1851 to 1998. However, this data has been supplemented with monthly data up to January 2020. In this paper, we analyse the tropical Indian ocean – which includes the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian subcontinent - variability over the 20th century in these climate models by using the CRU TS3H dataset as an independent reference for comparison purposes. Our results indicate that most of these models simulate the Indian summer monsoon circulation well",130,189,0.6729559748427673,8.485651967184141,0.9218617373781024,0.03549485086477438,0.9066666666666666,0.9037037037037032,0.8527916381087435,95.50573005093379,112.55974842767296,100.44984326018809

Climate change impacts and mitigation priorities for Indian Agriculture were presented on 22nd August, 2014. The presentation focused on the impact that global warming could have on agriculture. It started with an overview of the Indian agricultural sector followed by an analysis of how climate changes affect the crops. In addition, the presentation also dealt with the impacts on food security and agriculture productivity as projected by various international organisations. Subsequently, it focused upon the adaptation and adaptive capacity of Indian farmers. Finally, a brief overview was provided on how the agricultural practices in the country are changing to adapt to the climate.

Indian climate,Urban green space planning for climate adaptation in Indian cities,"Urban green space planning for climate adaptation in Indian cities: a review
Abstract:The increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change have led to the growing need to understand, plan and adapt to urban green spaces in cities. There is a need for a critical examination of the planning of urban greens in the context of adaptation to extreme events. The review aims to explore the role of green in adaptation, the extent of their planning in urban spaces, and to assess their potential contribution to adaptation. We found that urban trees, vegetation and green infrastructure are increasingly considered by local authorities as key elements of climate resilience through urban heat island mitigation, biodiversity conservation, water cycle regulation, urban cooling and air quality improvement. Urban tree-planting programmes are a key adaptation response in India, while green roofs and vegetative green walls are being increasingly implemented at large scale in many Indian and international cities as part of a broader suite of measures to adapt urban environments to future extremes.

Abstract/Description
Climate change is a global issue, but its impact is unevenly distributed. The 2030 Agenda of Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change call for a rapid reduction in the emissions of greenhouse gases, a shift towards renewable energies, sustainable urbanization and other climate-related measures. As climate impacts are felt in cities, the urban context is an important place for climate action and resilience planning. However, spatial planning has so far played an under",136,198,0.6170212765957447,8.460169506877884,0.9077901034421786,0.040546832132904415,0.8914285714285715,0.8853658536585358,0.8242298936335857,94.43973582828839,75.43085106382979,78.17442028985508

Summary
In this paper, we investigate the climate sensitivity or the change of agricultural yields in response to climate variability for India’s agricultural sub-sectors. Using a panel dataset on 26 major crops for 2000–2010 from 13 Indian states, this study shows that climate is a key factor in determining the agricultural yield variability. Our analyses also reveal that spatial variation exists and that the impact of climate on the yield of a particular area depends on its distance from the climatic zone, and the crop types grown in an area. The results indicate that there is spatial heterogeneity in the sensitivity to climatic change in terms of its effects on agricultural production and yields.
The paper also examines the relationship between climate and agriculture using two types of statistical analysis. First, using an error correction model, the results show that Indian agricultural sectors respond to the variability in climate in a lagged manner. Second, a vector error-correction",138,191,0.4816753926701571,6.656886368690279,0.8609202546278586,0.06097225379037469,0.9085714285714285,0.8938922155688614,0.781561597722078,66.28910486269663,64.41361256544502,65.24009620826259

Climate Change (CC) is one of several threats to the desert ecosystem. It is a global phenomenon with a local effect on the climate of any particular area.
The deserts of Rajasthan form the largest desert eco-region in India. The deserts cover approximately 1,30,000 km2 or 13.1 per cent of India’s total area, with an average annual average rainfall of less than 150 mm. These deserts form a vital part of our ecosystem and are the main habitat for a number of species, such as the endangered Great Indian Bustard, the Desert Fox, and the Blackbuck antelope. Many migratory birds also visit this area every year on their way north and south. Desert ecosystems are also important in the water cycle, storing rainwater in their sand and rock layers, thus maintaining the fragile equilibrium of desert ecosystems. They are a key source for water supply for millions of people in Rajasthan.

Abstract
This article investigates how traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) of time and season is embedded in climate-change related TEK among three Indian communities. It shows that climate season-time-related knowledge is a complex phenomenon which is influenced by many factors including: cultural context; ecological and meteorological conditions in a particular location, social context and historical factors. The article also explores how time-seasonal knowledge can help us understand the dynamics of the local climate in relation to cultural and ecological changes as well as to climate impacts and risks. Finally, the study illustrates how the knowledge about seasonal and temporal variations in weather and climate can be integrated into climate and disaster management plans.",140,186,0.5555555555555556,7.264831572567789,0.8856816167680313,0.05119506599225218,0.8599999999999999,0.8688435374149661,0.8020684961501563,60.6252276867031,62.62573099415204,64.0384737577837

AbstractWe present an analysis of the climate sensitivity to the radiative forcing due to changes in atmospheric constituents in models that simulate tropical ocean and sea level rise over the past century. We find the simulated oceanic heating by anthropogenic radiatively forcing is mainly due 1/3 to increased surface wind speed – 2/1 to enhanced evaporation - 3/4 to a stronger ocean-atmosphere coupling and 4/5 to reduced latent",142,199,0.7209302325581395,8.188193428828301,0.9326696415452697,0.03190120662778361,0.8800000000000001,0.8746666666666666,0.8499937668623734,111.37704918032787,113.51162790697674,73.46190476190476

The monsoons in the tropics are driven by large-scale patterns and associated with the large interannual and interdecadal variation of their atmospheric circulation. A number of studies have investigated their relationship with ENSO, which in turn is a major component of large scale atmospheric phenomena. In this contribution, the monoseasonal variability of Indian monomodal summer rainfall in India is analysed. The monimodal character of rainfall was confirmed using the monthly rainfall data for six meteorological stations in southern peninsular India. This study is carried out using 30-year monthly average (1981–2011) precipitation data.

The Indian summer monsoon has been regarded as a climate indicator of major global scale in many previous studies, and it is of great scientific interest to understand its past behaviour. The Indian monsoonal rainfall regime is strongly influenced by climate in the Indian Ocean, the North Atlantic, Pacific Ocean and East Asia.
However, there are some discrepancies and uncertainties in climate reconstructions of the ISM over the last several millennia and in particular over past 1000 years. This is mainly due to the lack of direct climate proxies (e.g., pollen) and the paucity/uncertainty of other proxies. In this paper, recent studies from both direct and indirect proxies and models will be critically evaluated to address this issue.",144,198,0.6206896551724138,7.474093186836597,0.9041692610506536,0.044338002066400546,0.8959999999999999,0.9024793388429755,0.800308685161052,67.33618233618233,68.37931034482759,56.369960343688035

Abstract
The present scenario depicts the impact of climatic change which will be the major factor in determining the fate of groundwater in the future. Ground water is the most important source of drinking and irrigation water and it can meet up to the requirements of a majority of people living in rural as well as urban areas. The present study is based on comprehensive assessment of hydro-meteorological parameters to investigate their impact on ground water resources of India. A comprehensive literature review is presented and analyzed in order to understand the present status and the possible effects on hydrosphere of global climate changes in India, in this regard, the main emphasis has been laid on the hydrological changes and their impacts. It is concluded that the changes will affect all the three components of water cycle, viz., precipitation, evaporation, and transpiration. However, there is a wide variation in precipitation change among regions. As precipitation is an important parameter that governs the availability of ground waters,",146,191,0.4975369458128079,7.088810304070324,0.8686131377262313,0.056939149673508695,0.86,0.838659217877095,0.7540515988584057,50.75,50.310344827586206,47.8632637017071

This paper investigates the media coverage of climate issues in Australia, India and Germany over the 15 years of 2000-2014. We analyse how issues are framed by the print press, how the coverage varies over time and whether the climate debate influences media reporting on other environmental issues. By using a quantitative text analysis of all climate articles in three national newspapers over a period of almost two decades, we find that the frequency of coverage and the framing of the issue differ markedly from one country to the next and that media reports on climate in Germany have become increasingly prominent.

Abstract
In the western Himalaya, the impacts of climate change are beginning to have serious implications for communities, livelihoods, and ecosystems. We present a local level analysis of how climate variability and change is perceived by residents of the upper Kali River Valley (UKRV) of Uttarakhand and how this has been manifested in terms of changes in livelihood practices and adaptation measures. A series of interviews with community representatives (‘panchayat’) and key informants ('kumaonis') and observations of agricultural fields and livestock were conducted. The UKRV is characterized by high levels of precipitation during the main monsoon season, a ‘dry’ period of around three months from May to August, an increase in average summer temperatures, changes to precipitation and temperature patterns during winter season and an earlier onset of spring snowmelt. These climate conditions have led to significant",148,181,0.5580110497237569,7.50727087709638,0.8877797734776209,0.049706024485297436,0.8571428571428571,0.8560509554140128,0.7948223050328311,53.4482984609229,54.10497237569061,52.05399504692388

Abstract
The paper presents a synthesis of the current literature on the impacts of climate change on water and agricultural production in India, and explores the possible adaptation strategies available. It is based on secondary analysis and draws from a comprehensive set of studies on agricultural impacts. We present evidence suggesting that, due to the increasing severity of water deficits, the production of major food crops (cereals, rice, wheat and pulses) will decrease significantly in the near future. The most vulnerable crops to climate variations seem to be rice and wheat. A decline in rice yields may reach up to 40% by 2075 due primarily to water scarcity, although climate variability is expected to increase. Wheat production may decline by up 30% over the same period. Our analysis reveals a strong association between temperature and crop yield variability, as well as between water deficit and yield variation.",149,186,0.5396825396825397,7.419408268023741,0.882334229407988,0.051688005648197276,0.8742857142857143,0.8843636363636361,0.8095183387695533,54.60893617021276,63.10582010582011,59.56176846137476

Abstract. The Indian summer monsoons play a crucial role in the economy of Asia and the Pacific, and their predictability for agricultural production can help to mitigate the adverse impacts of a more variable and less predictable rainfall. Here we assess the climatic impacts on Indian summers of both ENSO and its counterpart, the IOD/ENSO-like oscillations, using a 30-year reanalysis product from ECMWF and climate simulations from the EC-Earth global climate model. Our analysis of the climate data sets indicates a close connection between the two climatic modes and a common source region in central Africa.

Abstract
Agriculture in India relies heavily on the use of groundwater. However, in a context of climate and land-use change it is necessary to assess the impact of this practice on water availability and on land and groundwater quality. The present article examines the effects of increased use, by Indian farmers, of water from aquifers that are recharged mainly through rainfall, and which are subject to seasonal fluctuation, on groundwater levels and its quality (“pulse irrigation”). It uses an original data set of “water pulse” surveys conducted over the last 40 years in 10 Indian agro-climatic zones (ACZs). The results show that pulse irrigation has become more widespread over this period and that, while the water-pump technology used in the practice is generally appropriate, its use has increased the risk of salinization in areas with a high potential for salinity",152,181,0.5469613259668509,7.358612047846947,0.883932379396913,0.05141016170107928,0.8742857142857143,0.8861146496815286,0.8042271073868469,64.55543432658445,68.86187845303867,62.901952214452216

Climate-change adaptation in the agricultural sector in India is of critical concern, since agricultural productivity is highly susceptible to the impacts of global climate change. This paper examines local perspectives about how climate variability affects apple production in Kullu Valley in Himachal Pradesh, North India. The paper is based on a survey with 250 apple growers in 2012 and 210 respondents in a follow-up survey in March/April (2015). The analysis focuses on local adaptation strategies and the impact of extreme weather events in terms of lost income, crop damage and changes in farm production. It is shown that apple-farming communities in this region have a high level of awareness and concern for climate impacts, but they have limited understanding of what is actually happening and what the possible consequences might be. In general, the majority of respondents did not report significant changes and were not able to identify specific reasons",153,181,0.5721925133689839,7.824614938160297,0.8932769660729453,0.04697644132407527,0.9085714285714285,0.9013496932515337,0.8019943232814685,70.46988448844886,75.00534759358288,80.52322984141166

Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) are an efficient and flexible technique for visualising multidimensional data, particularly when the data are highly complex; they are also a valuable tool for detecting patterns. In this study, SOM models were used to examine relationships between sea surface temperature [SST = Ts] anomalies in 10–200 m layer and atmospheric variables in southern tropical Indian ocean – the region of strong El Niño events. The study period included 1986–2011 and data were provided by National Centres for Environmental Prediction & National Oceanic + Atmospheric Administration “CPC” data archive.

Abstract
This study explores the vulnerability of coastal areas to climate change, specifically sea level rise and associated impacts, in four districts of North Eastern India. A vulnerability profile of 14 coastal districts was created by using the Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI), the Sea Level Rise Vulnerable Index of United Nations Environment Program and the ‘Climate-Related Security Risks’ of Global Institute of Security Studies. The coastal vulnerability was analysed using a geographic information system. It was found that the coastal zones of Assam and Meghalaya are highly vulnerable to sea levels rising as compared to the other two coastal states of Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. This is because of their high population density and low elevation as a proportion to",155,180,0.5823529411764706,7.592953389588967,0.8947235578765801,0.04719966510524967,0.88,0.8816438356164386,0.8118074819822266,68.38611154858596,71.87647058823529,69.02104690897795

Glaciation and interannual precipitation changes over the tropical region are often modeled in global circulation models (GCMs) using prescribed sea-surface temperature (“SST”) changes as a result of ocean heat content (""OHC"") variations. These models can simulate the glacial-interglacials “sawtooth” pattern of climate change. However, the models may not reproduce some of key characteristics such as interhemispheric asymmetry and a pronounced interdecadal variability over tropical oceans, both of which are observed in the Last Interglacier – Last Glacial Maximum (<IGM - LIG) period (~120,000 <IGY >130,100 yr).

In the last weeks of May 2019, a major climate-event hit East African lake regions, bringing torrential downpours that led to massive flooding in the region and downstream. The floods caused significant damage to crops and pastures, and also to human life. At least 15 people were reported dead.
This event has had a direct, but also indirect, impact on the livelihoods and food security of pastoralists living around the lake basins. In the East-African Great Lakes region, the floods are part of a climate crisis that has been ongoing for several years. This crisis includes droughts, floods, cyclones, heatwaves and other severe weather conditions, with negative consequences on agricultural and livestock production, health systems and infrastructure.

This study examines the spatial and temporal variations of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over India during the past thirty years. The results obtained indicate that there has been no significant changes in NDVIs from 20012007. However, there was an increased NDVIS in 2011 and 0.01 < p >.05 over some regions. An interesting observation is that the regions affected by droughts show a significant increase in the NDVS. This is attributed to a change in precipitation patterns.

Land use, land-cover and climatic change are known to affect aquatic ecosystems. The effects of land use change have attracted much of the recent scientific attention, but the effects on the functioning of wet ecosystems have remained relatively poorly studied.
In the present study, the influence of a changing vegetation structure and its effects are examined on wet meadow ecosystem in the Himalayan foothills, India. Wet meadows in this area are dominated by species of Carex and Juncus, which are typical aquatic wet species. In the wet meadowe studied, a gradual shift from a wet to a dry meadow can be observed. This shift can have implications for the ecosystem. We hypothesized that the vegetation composition of this wet site has been altered by anthropogenic activities, such as land clearance for cropping and shifting cultivation, and is now closer to what it would be in drier conditions.

Abstract
The global atmospheric circulation is driven predominantly by two different kinds of insolarforcing: the meridional temperature gradient and the zonal temperature gradients. These two types offorcing can be either directly derived from the insolaion or can indirectly arise by changes in the atmospheric heat content and moisture budget caused by the solar irradiation. A recent paper has shown by using a simple coupled model that the orbital insolareforcing, in combination with the tropical sea surface temperature forcing, can lead to a global change ofthe precipitation over the tropics, which is a result of changes induced by both meridianallocation and changes of atmospheric water content. In this paper, the authors aim to examine the role ofmeridionalliation and atmospheric humidity changes as an insoleroading mechanism",163,180,0.6363636363636364,8.17423891369599,0.9114786622666826,0.03991971980870331,0.88,0.873191489361702,0.8331001763527206,88.69197247295385,90.44848484848485,82.71248282967034

The Indian monsoon climate is very unstable and has been undergoing significant changes over the past few years, and these changes may be more severe in future. The objective of this present study is to assess the impact of future climate changes on rice-wheat production using a regional crop yield simulation model. For this purpose, three future climates (2050s, 2070-2099s and 2100–2150) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5, Representative concentration pathway 8.0, Intermittend Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Regional Climate Model 5 and Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change AR5 were used to simulate rice productivity and yield.

The impact of Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) variability on the coupled general circulation – climate system in a state-of-the-art atmosphere ocean coupled model, the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory version 2 [GFLD2] is investigated. GFLDs coupled ocean model is run in both the control experiment and a perturbed SST experiment. For this experiment, a perturbation of 5 K is imposed on 2003 mean sea SSTA. A 7.5% reduction in global mean SLP is found in this case, which leads to a poleward shift in midlatitude westerly winds. An increase in mean global cloud cover also occurs. In both experiments, there is a significant reduction of the meridional ocean heat transport from the Indo-Pacific region.

The Indian monsoonal rainfall season is a highly variable phenomenon in the tropics but is subject to large-scale, persistent variability. This variability is thought to be due to a complex combination of large scale circulation patterns, including the Madden–Julian Oscillation and the El Niño–Southern Oscilation and small scale processes including cloud systems such as the Asian Summer Monsoon Precipitation Enhancement (“ASMOE”) effect and convection-permitting cloud schemes. Here, the impact of domain-level resolutions on the simulation of rainfall over the South Asian region is investigated using the regional Climate Prediction and Applications Center – North American Regional Reanalysis 3 “RCA3",168,186,0.6424242424242425,8.252088808112143,0.9133350753449254,0.0390825488866379,0.8866666666666667,0.8618439716312059,0.844536721715332,89.89072528244841,85.15757575757576,66.82667332667333

Abstract
Biofuelled transport is an important aspect of the current bioenergy policy in India. This article provides an overview of Indian biofuel policies as well as the bio-energy potential of India and its contribution to global climate mitigation. It also describes India‟s bioeconomy policy and the challenges associated with it. The author analyses the global bioethanol and biodiesel markets, highlighting the impact of these global markets on India, and also discusses the role of biohydrogen, biochar, methane and cellulosic ethanol as potential substitutes for bioalcohols. Finally, the author suggests some measures for addressing the key challenges of achieving sustainable bio energy production in a resource-constrained context. He argues that there is a need for more comprehensive policy frameworks that take into account the inter-linkages of global and Indian energy, agriculture, environment and economic policies.",169,184,0.5853658536585366,7.496340570653091,0.8949936740627862,0.04741026146370229,0.8666666666666667,0.8722857142857133,0.7989999007596077,64.64716986220101,61.99390243902439,54.81856540084388

One important component of this work involves a better understanding of how the SPCZ influences the dynamics and structure of tropical and subtropical oceans in both hemispheres. The SPSC may also have an important connection to global circulation and climate. In particular, this research involves an examination of: (1) the role of eddies that are associated with the southern hemisphere SPS in transporting heat and moisture into the subtropics during winter (“winter warmings”), and [2] the transport into midlatitudes of heat from the eastern Indian Ocean.

Abstract:
The North India summer season monSoons are known to exhibit strong interannual variability in terms of their onset timing and their intensity. This variability appears to be connected to the variability of Indian winter mon Soons, which are associated with the El Nio Southern Oscillation, or E NSO. A strong E nSo relationship was reported to exist from 1939 to 2001, but the strength of the E So relationship varied significantly from year to year, especially from the 1960s onwards. In the recent past, the relationship has weakened, and in fact the onset of monSons during the past 50 years has become increasingly earlier. There are several factors associated to this weakening. The first is global warming, caused mainly by increasing greenhouse gases and the second is associated directly with changes in Indian monSon rainfall.

Abstract. The study reviews the available literature on climate-related impacts of extreme precipitation events in the Indian context. It is observed that extreme events are projected to be enhanced under the future climate scenarios of both, the IPCC Special Report on the Impacts of Global Warming of 0.5 °C and 4.0 ° C, while the frequency and intensity are expected to increase with the projected increase in temperature. In the context of future projections of flood events, there is a general upward trend in flood occurrence with increased flood peak discharge and higher recurrence intervals. Under the Special Climate Report scenario, flood peaks have the potential to rise by 2-6 mm/day with a significant increase of the occurrence of floods during the monsoon season.",173,184,0.5114942528735632,6.74707258785224,0.8700500594392814,0.057999144924096815,0.84,0.841866666666666,0.7650172075196768,53.19867549668874,50.90229885057471,43.28929204660588

AbstractThe Indian Himalayan region is the most sensitive region in terms of climate and environmental changes. A better understanding of the potential impacts of these changes on socio environmental systems in this region would enable the development of appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The present study assesses the vulnerabilities of different socioenvironmentally important systems along a height gradient to the climate changes in Himachal Pradesh. For this purpose, the spatial distributions of temperature, precipitation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were extracted from 20km resolution MODIS satellite images for the period 2001–2010. These were then used to generate monthly and yearly maps for temperature and precipitation for four different altitudinal ranges. In addition to this, for two locations in different climatic conditions (< 1500 m and > 4000m), the NDVI values were calculated by using Landsat TM images at a spatial resolution of 30 m.

Abstract
The study investigates the reliability and consistency of climate simulations over the Indian summer monsoonal region using different climate models and downscaling techniques. The reliability is evaluated for the summer of 2006 and 2010 over two regions: India (30oN–30°N, 60oE–90o E) and the North Atlantic Ocean (>10o N,>90° E), using the Standard Observation Network / ERA-Interim 0.5° gridded data. Consistency is assessed by comparing the observed and simulated values of the standard deviation and bias. Reliability and inconsistency are analyzed for two different time scales. It is found that reliability for summer 06 is higher for 3–6-month periods than that of a year. However, reliability decreases over a 12-months period. In the consistency analysis reliability increases with decreasing time scale.

Abstract
We assess the sensitivity of winter wheat yields in the Indian monsoon to past variations in temperature, precipitation and radiation in a historical climatology over India 1871-2011. We find that wheat has been more sensitive to temperature than moisture over the majority of the country, particularly in south-western regions. The sensitivity to moisture has become more important in recent years, with precipitation becoming the main driver of yields. Over the north-east wheat production is more influenced by precipitation, whereas over southwestern India the most important factor is temperature. In the future, we find a decrease for the wheat yield in all regions, and this decline is particularly large for south west India, where wheat is currently most vulnerable to climate change.",177,182,0.48823529411764705,6.365809407433174,0.8603999284548542,0.06258832928524623,0.8666666666666667,0.8734246575342464,0.758817506264622,54.10950661853188,50.26470588235294,49.33341523341523

Abstract
The air quality and health impacts of the growing cities with their large population and increasing motorization in India are a matter of serious concern for the society and the policymakers. A few studies have assessed these impacts in the Indian context, but most of them are focused on the rural areas. This paper provides a review of air pollution and climate-sensitive health issues in urban areas of India. It is found that air pollutants in cities pose significant risks to the health of Indian population with the increasing number of vehicles and rapid urbanization. Air pollution has been shown to be a significant risk factor of a number health outcomes, including premature deaths (mainly from cardiovascular disease, stroke), hospitalizations, reduced lung function, decreased respiratory health & lung cancer. The health effects of climate changes in future may further exacerbate the situation. Therefore, a set of policy measures need to take up to reduce the air and climatic pollutants",179,184,0.5333333333333333,7.447594690010102,0.8807872725114368,0.05205717280300597,0.8742857142857143,0.8811695906432746,0.7814950864953081,67.65888237902453,59.91794871794872,63.897465437788014

Abstract
The study investigates climate changes in future using the regional climate models under the representative pathways of 4.0 and above for three subregions (North East India, North India and South East Asia) of India for the 21st century. These are selected due to their high economic and agricultural production which may be affected in coming decades. It shows that the climate of the North-East and North regions are highly affected by global warming in the future. The annual average temperature increases by up to 0.9 to1°C by the end of century under RCP 8. 5 for these regions with an annual increase of up 3 to4°c in winter season under high concentration pathway Rcp 6.3. However, the annual rainfall increases with the increase in temperature. This is also the main reason for decreasing annual runoff in both these sub regions",180,194,0.5393258426966292,7.19550421436027,0.8808450116004082,0.05294788896176746,0.8914285714285715,0.8802597402597403,0.806893363919713,53.33764483966586,59.151685393258425,58.463763509218055

Abstract
We present a new proxy for the Mediterranean wave index (MWI) reconstructed using the oxygen isotope ratios of benthic foraminifera from the Ligurian Sea. We use the δ18O record to reconstruct the MWI in detail back to ~200 BC. The new MWP-LIA is similar in length to the previous reconstructions, with similar characteristics of the LIA-MWP transition. Our reconstruction of MWS shows a significant variability that is related to North Atlantic variability. This suggests that MTS, and hence MCS variability, is influenced by NAW variability at longer time scales. However, MWD is not related with any significant NAWS variability in this time period. MWR shows the same long- and short-time scales variability of NAWR and MWR, respectively. These long cycles are not directly",182,193,0.5714285714285714,7.406560798180411,0.8907845975918441,0.049078752021136,0.8733333333333334,0.8552777777777772,0.8142377571306658,61.47555093743151,61.595238095238095,49.927974762285615

The southern oscillation (El Niño–Southern Oscilation) is a phenomenon of global significance, with impacts on climate as well as fisheries, agriculture, tourism, shipping, air quality, etc. The oceanic circulation is one of the principal drivers for climate variability in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, the most important being the trade winds and associated currents. In this study, a method of analysis by means of multivariate clustering was used to assess the impact of this phenomenon on surface-water circulation in all the three ocean basins in question. This method is based on the assumption that the circulation of water parcels in space is characterized by an intrinsic pattern or “signature” that can be quantified and used as a basis for clustering. For this purpose the authors used the ocean surface current vector from the NOAA Global Circulation Model. Clustering of time series was carried out using the Ward algorithm and then the clusters were analyzed with respect to their geographical",183,196,0.5336538461538461,7.696465222625054,0.8823412837507801,0.050757334570890836,0.8649999999999999,0.860217391304347,0.7850457285470854,63.2156862745098,63.19230769230769,51.247143701369055

Climate change, being one of the important issues of today’s world, is also an issue of importance for the agricultural community. In spite of its importance, it has been a subject of research in the Indian context in very less. The research objective of this paper is to study the farmer perceptions on climate changes in Uttar Pradesh (North Indian state) of India. For this purpose, a questionnaire survey was administered to 100 farmers. Results of study show that farmers perceive a change in their farming conditions due to climate variability, which may be caused by climate-change. This perception is more for those farmers who have more education and experience. Farmers have perceived that climate has changed their agriculture conditions. However, they have not perceived the change due climate warming. They are also of view that temperature changes have led to an increase in crop productivity as well as crop growth time.

Abstract
Climate change is already affecting many parts of the world. The study aims to develop a method for local climate zone classification (LCZ) in Nagaur to improve the climate modeling of future climate change impacts in India. A combination of methods based on the temperature and humidity data from meteorological stations were applied to identify different climate zones. These methods included the cluster analysis method and the K-Means clustering approach to find the most homogeneous groups of stations. Subsequently, the results were validated against the World Climate Map developed by NOAA/NCDC. This was achieved through the application of an expert-based method, i.e., the expert committee was asked to review and select the best groupings of climate stations from the identified zones by the method of cluster and K – means. Finally, this resulted in a classification with six zones for Naguar. In the first stage, a total of 17 stations of meteorology department in the city of Maharashtra were used",188,196,0.5204081632653061,7.285714285714286,0.8762547068196003,0.05398406169655018,0.8914285714285713,0.8741860465116283,0.7759214365103486,62.592841163310965,59.09183673469388,60.3923358520674

The reconstructed record indicates that the enhanced monsoons began to occur in ~ 3000 yr B.P.; this was about 1000 years later than previously proposed. This is likely due to the fact that our reconstructions include records that have been previously overlooked in some studies. We also provide some evidence for the existence of a monoseasonality shift, which occurred between about
200 and

Abstract. A ""Rossby-wave"" mechanism for a significant fraction of the Indian ocean variability has been found by a recent numerical model study. This phenomenon has not been observed by the observational records. The mechanism is a consequence of a 3-dimensional wave mode of Ross by (1990). We present a simple theoretical model to explain the observations of this mechanism by Ross and Schmitt - two authors of our recent paper and discuss the possible implications.",190,193,0.6068376068376068,6.563952321998544,0.8951121767924981,0.05071489228678197,0.8999999999999999,0.8662365591397845,0.7815561937617993,58.27801877272701,54.34188034188034,48.866381766381764

Lomblok ridge is an ocean ridge with a 150-m-thick, 200-km-long, Late Pleistocene-Holocene sequence of basaltic lava flows that are erupted from its flank. The ridge forms a major boundary for the circulation of surface water masses of the Indian and western Pacific Oceans, which in turn control the global oceanic circulation. To better constrain the timing of changes in ocean and atmospheric circulation, and to understand the influence of these changes on the ocean’s heat content, we have analyzed an archive of sedimentary charcoal preserved in Lomblock Ridge, in the Indo-west Pacific, through >1.9 million years (Ma), to reconstruct the fire regimes of its terrestrial environment.

India is a country of diverse ecosystems, with a total area of 3,287,000 km2, comprising of different agro-ecological regions. India is among the highest biodiversity rich countries, yet is the 12th largest global carbon emitter in the world, due to the rapid rate of deforestation and the increasing population of the country. It is also the second most populous country, and has a population that is growing by 1.3% per annum. Climate change is one of many threats to food security, as climate patterns become increasingly uncertain and unpredictable. This research aims to understand the current status of forest resources in India and their impact on the environment and people.

Challenging scenarios for Indian Agriculture
Agriculture in India faces many challenges due to climate change including, but not limited to changing rainfall patterns, higher temperature, changing crop phenology, pests, diseases and water logging. The challenges will have impact on food production and security. These challenges have the potential to increase rural poverty, food insecurity and migration in the long term. However, these challenges also offer a set of opportunities in Indian agricultural sector for the farmers, researchers and other stakeholders. Some of these opportunities have been discussed below.
Farmers
The challenges posed by climate changes have already impacted Indian farmers and their crop. Crop losses due the vagaries of weather are well reported. Farmers are already adapting to the climatic changes to some extent by shifting to crops which can be grown in a wide variety of climates and seasons and by adopting new",194,183,0.520618556701031,7.251377402039155,0.8760905053794897,0.054160941046359504,0.8628571428571429,0.84235294117647,0.791182540260823,57.37841530054645,51.103092783505154,48.690021231422506

Abstract
This paper reviews the literature on climate and rice. This paper presents the results of a survey of the impact of climatic variables on the rice yield in south India. It also provides an analysis of how climate variability may affect rice cultivation in future. The survey reveals the following. There is a clear increase in rice productivity during the period 1959-1979. During the same period, there was no significant change in rainfall or mean air temperature over the state of kerala. However, the number of rice cropping seasons increased from 2.5 in 1980s to 3.25 in early 1990 s. In contrast, it was noted that the rainfall pattern and temperature have changed in keralam. Thus, rice may be less sensitive to the current change of temperature but more sensitive towards rainfall patterns in coming decades.",196,199,0.550561797752809,7.345410552159442,0.8848241988826662,0.05117969134613333,0.8457142857142858,0.8475324675324667,0.7736359282110187,46.97349643221203,47.5,46.013150699912515

Abstract
This study is aimed at understanding the role of Indian ocean dipole in the climate variability of East African region by examining the relationship between SST, sea level pressure and sea surface height anomalies, the ENSO phase and the Indian Pacific SSTA. The results indicate a close link between the SLP of the ITCZ, SSS and Indian EPO. During the warm phase of E-S (1998, 2002) there was an increase in both SLS and SLAI and a decrease in SSAI, while during the cold phase (~1990), a significant increase was observed in all the parameters and there were no significant difference in any of them. A similar pattern is observed during El-Nino /La- Nino periods. It is found that the variability and spatial pattern of SLE - EO is highly correlated",197,181,0.593939393939394,7.629289652782925,0.8979664005632206,0.04601323031132481,0.8866666666666667,0.8604255319148933,0.7914044855914466,56.98470038249044,58.7939393939394,47.826120781872994

Abstract
The late Eurypalaeozoic Indian continent experienced rapid environmental changes during its evolution from a hot and humid environment to a cooler and drier one. It has been proposed that this change was driven by the onset of the South Atlantic Anoxic Event (SAAE) at the base of Epochs 40 – 41. 6 Ma. A key to understanding this climate change is the determination of when tropical and subtropic latitudes occupied the present-day positions. We show that, based on palaeolocations, this region is not the same as the equatorial zone occupied today, but is more comparable to that occupied 50 Ma ago during E",198,189,0.625,7.905694150420948,0.9073916192121428,0.0420160342978542,0.8933333333333334,0.8988235294117646,0.8209214447315616,80.0,83.93125,82.20044512449576

The residential sector is one of the most energy-intensive sectors in the world. A majority of residential energy used for heating and cooling, lighting, appliances, and entertainment. In India, residential electricity consumption is 7.6% of energy consumption, which will likely increase in future.
A residential house is a major source of greenhouse-gas emissions and energy use. It is estimated that 25% to 30% — or 50 million metric tons of CO2 annually – is emitted as a result of its construction. The construction and operation of buildings are major energy consumers, accounting for about 40% and 60% respectively in total building energy usage worldwide. Residential energy accounts for 12%–16% percent of total residential consumption. This is higher than in non-residential buildings and lower than residential space heating in some countries.

Abstract
Coral reefs are among the world’s great biodiversity hotspots, supporting a wide variety of organisms including humans, but they are threatened by climate warming. Coral bleachers are one of the best indicators of coral reef health, and in 1998 bleached and dead corals were found on all coral atolls in French Polynesia, which was previously considered to be an area with little impact of climate changes. The bleaches were not only the longest recorded, lasting almost four months on the atoll of Moorea, in a region that usually has two to three months bleeching, they were also among those longest in terms of area affected. These were the first recorded bleeches for French polynesia and the most extensive bleachings ever reported in any tropical coral region. We review the bleache and their ecological implications with a focus on their relationship to climate variation, the role of local factors such as water quality and sedimentation, reef fish community structure and dynamics,",200,198,0.5824742268041238,8.112927192380441,0.8974022602675605,0.044845555622325936,0.8857142857142858,0.8922352941176461,0.8056471644137048,74.17614565762526,77.1701030927835,66.02072968490879

The Indian monsoon has been a vital element in sustaining the agricultural productivity in India and in surrounding countries for many millennia. In the 21st century, the climate is predicted to become more severe as the mean annual sea surface temperature of the equatorial Indian and Pacific oceans increase and the precipitation is likely to increase, thereby increasing the monsoonal rainfall. However, there are still some uncertainties about the mode shift from the present-day “wet mon So, we have developed a simple climate model, which includes both the land and sea. Based on this climate system, a climate change scenario with two climate modes has also been developed using an atmospheric general circulation model. The first climate mode is the existing mode and it is used as a reference scenario. A second climate scenario is simulated for a future period (2011–2055) using the same model with different initial conditions.

Abstract
The Indian agricultural system has been highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. This has become even more severe with the increased occurrence of extreme climate events. In this study, we have investigated the sensitivity of the crop-based crop productivity of two agroecological zones in India—the North Western India (NW) and North-Eastern India. For this purpose, a multi-criteria approach was used in which the impact of various climatic variables on the yield of rice and wheat crops for different agroclimatic zones were evaluated. The results indicate that crop yields in both zones will decline by 30 and 20%, respectively, by the end of this century. Further, the results reveal that the NW agrozone is comparatively more sensitive to temperature variability than the NE agrozones. However, in terms of relative impact on yield, both regions exhibit higher sensitivity in the",206,182,0.5376344086021505,7.332355751067665,0.8812463507183071,0.052325610031986755,0.8514285714285714,0.8585185185185179,0.7940385587384827,56.42446043165468,53.79032258064516,51.90790322580645

Abstract. In the past 50 yr, the climate of northern North America and eastern Asia during the summer has become increasingly dry. To determine the physical mechanisms of this trend, we analyzed the atmospheric circulation and ocean–atmosphere interaction during 1950–2009 by using the coupled climate model MIROC5. The results indicated that the decrease in summer precipitation in the northwestern Pacific during this period was associated with a decrease of 6–10 % in sea surface temperature (>2 °C) over the western North Pacific and an increase of precipitation >30 %. The decrease also occurred in an area that receives more than 90 %, and sometimes more 100 $, of",208,187,0.6190476190476191,8.023774198028779,0.9064058447347364,0.04205894256310998,0.88,0.8933333333333339,0.8131911203581486,77.63636363636363,76.60714285714286,79.05997425997427
Indian climate,Modeling the impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on cereal production: evidence from Indian agricultural sector,"Modeling the impact of climatic and non-climatic factors on cereal production: evidence from Indian agricultural sector
This study analyzes the production of Indian agriculture crops (cereals, pulses, vegetables and potatoes) under climatic / non climatic stresses, using a stochastic production model. The stochastic model is calibrated to the 1989-90 data from the National Sample Survey Office, Government of India using maximum likelihood method. Using the calibrated model, the effects of climate and other nonclimate factors - on crop production – have been examined for a range of scenarios. Results suggest that climatic shocks are likely to have more impact on the yields of crops than non climate shocks. In addition, crop specific impacts vary substantially across crops. Climate shocks, particularly precipitation shocks have the largest impact, followed by temperature shocks in case of cereals and pulses and temperature shock in potato production. Other climate variables, such as sunshine hours, are less important for crop yields, although these do affect production in some crops like wheat, rice, cotton and oilseeds..",209,200,0.5126903553299492,7.195952048778874,0.873545816856789,0.05511268010894015,0.88,0.8598843930635832,0.7836201916529687,54.2685664939551,55.33502538071066,50.66069173224521

Indian climate,"Constructions of climate justice in German, Indian and US media","Constructions of climate justice in German, Indian and US media
Abstract
The article explores the ways in which climate injustice is constructed in the German mainstream media and the international press in a comparative perspective. The German and International press coverage of the UN Climate Conference in Copenhagen 2009 is analysed. A discourse network analysis is undertaken to identify discursive constructions of justice and injustices. Findings of an in-depth textual analysis show that climate change is framed in nationalistic discourses. Climate justice is discursively constructed as a moral and political problem of ‘global justice’ and as the need of a “green” global economic transformation. This analysis shows that the construction of injustice depends on a national and local media discourse.

Abstract
ZOOGEOGRAPHIC relationships among species, and the relative effects of Pleisto-cene climatic fluctuations on West India were investigated by comparing zoogeographical data with the distribution of fossil vertebral material from the Pleiocene of the Caribbean. The Caribbean vertebra fauna is dominated by the large herbivores such as the tapirs, the glyptodonts, proboscideans and mastodonders, but it contains a significant proportion of small carnivorous mammals which are absent in modern West Indies. These mammals probably originated in South America. They were not present in the West African zoogeo-graphy during the Oligocene, so that they must have been present during a climatic period that was warmer than now. This warming is suggested to be a response to a northward advance in polar ice. It is argued that the present day distribution patterns of verte-brate fauna may be regarded as a “reaction norm",214,194,0.6352941176470588,8.2832218795516,0.9116656902550473,0.039603825444416735,0.84,0.8627397260273969,0.8243428766419173,88.47236796827355,83.45294117647059,69.66101694915254

Abstract
The Indian monsoons are one of most intense monolithic climate system in the world and the source of water for a huge amount of population. The monologue nature of this climate can be explained as the strong influence of solar insolation and atmospheric dynamics on the regional circulation of monoclonal climate. In order to investigate the role of climate change in future monoclone climate, one needs to have a better understanding of its variability and predictability. To understand the climate variability, the model should be able to produce realistic monocal climate and its associated extreme. However, it is difficult to model the monoclimte accurately due to the complex atmospheric flow, land-atmosphere interactions, and strong coupling of atmospheric and land surface parameters. Therefore, to predict the future climate under climate changes, an understanding and simulation of natural and anthropogenic variability of Indian Summer Monsoon is a must.

Abstract
The equators of the two oceans in Earth's global ocean have been shown to display distinct modes of variability with respect to the tropical Pacific and the Atlantic. It has also been observed that in many parts of these oceans, a similar pattern is found for the equatoria of both oceans. In this paper, we show that a strong equatoriallity in these modes has emerged over tropical Indian oceans during recent years. The Indian equatorium shows the same mode as that of Atlantic Ocean during the 1930s",218,180,0.5870967741935483,7.30929589301274,0.8944039818067703,0.04821005799324369,0.8466666666666667,0.8509923664122133,0.7890015210144654,61.299083550739184,48.70322580645161,51.53789847539848

Abstract
We present a method of relating changes in lightning occurrence over an area with changes of the atmospheric circulation associated with a shift in the monsoon. We apply the method to the period 1960–1993 using daily lightning data from 14 stations over India (and the surrounding seas) and from a 3.5° × 1.6° grid over South Asia and the adjoining seas. The method consists of two components. First, we relate the occurrence of daily maximum lightning intensities [i.e., the maximum value of all occurrences of maximum daily intensifications] over a subregion to changes over this sub region in a parameter of circulation, namely, the circulation parameter that describes the difference in mean circulation in two opposite seasons. Second, based on the result obtained in Step 2, one obtains a relationship between the mean daily circulation ([T] in m s−2) during the season of occurrence for the region,",220,194,0.5,6.855654600401044,0.8676301226137632,0.05820610800129604,0.8285714285714285,0.8207317073170737,0.7636387852115701,43.513353115727,44.47872340425532,40.38544614926262

Abstract. The australian summer monsoon is the dominant rainfall region of the southern hemisphere and is one of most important sources of rainfall for the indian subcontinent. During the last three decades the strength and variability of this monsoonal rainfall system has been significantly reduced and has become more difficult to forecast. In the past, it was suggested, that the reduction in monosonal flow was related to the warming of tropical atlantic water in its southern portion, the ""warm pool"", and the associated increase in surface wind shear. To understand the changes in circulation and rainfall during these periods, a comprehensive set of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (A-OGCMs) and ocean general climate model analyses [from a 3-year hindcast -",221,199,0.5913978494623656,8.065591326174431,0.899484927089366,0.04428927059734041,0.8228571428571428,0.8419753086419759,0.8007233300513277,65.72516168983074,58.96774193548387,50.11538461538461

Abstract
The paper reviews the status of sheep farming in different agro-climatic zones of the country. The study revealed that the area under sheep is more in the northwestern, western and the northeastern part of India. In the present study, the climate of different regions was classified by using the Koppen-Geiger climatic classification system. Climate is one of most important factors influencing the livestock industry and its productivity is very much affected by it. It was found that during the last 30 years the annual temperature of many areas has risen by 3-4°C, which is 0.1-1° C above normal. Rainfall is likely to decrease in north and east but increase in south and west India in 2031 and beyond in all agroclimate zones. During winter the minimum temperature will rise by almost 1.5°-2.25° c and during summer the maximum will increase by about 2°c.

Indian climate,Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities,"Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities
The paper argues that migrants’ participation and inclusion in climate related decision-making are necessary if climate adaptation strategies are to succeed in protecting vulnerable communities and improving urban resilience. This will not be possible unless migrants are recognised as urban residents and their contributions in the face of climate change are formally recognised. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the experiences of and contributions of urban migrants to urban adaptation and climate resilience, particularly in South Asia.
This paper is based on a research project that investigated the contribution of informal migrants and marginal workers to the resilience of low income and informal settlements in three Indian metropolises. We found that informal migrant workers and other marginal groups (such as waste workers, recyclers, street vendors, and small traders) in informal urban settlements are disproportionately impacted by climate induced changes. These groups are also excluded from the formal city governance and urban planning processes. The research suggests that a significant number of migrant households living and working in low-income settlements face extreme vulnerability",223,200,0.5167464114832536,7.470516209753606,0.8764204945436014,0.05326366970745545,0.895,0.8908108108108101,0.7865538910253027,69.66666666666667,66.76076555023923,55.39300273636008

Abstract
A super-high resolution model of the global ocean and atmosphere is used to investigate a possible future Indian summer rainy season in the Indian monsoonal region. A global climate model is forced by the coupled atmospheric model and the ocean component with the Hadley Centre ocean model for a 20-year control simulation and a further 25 years, starting in 2020. The control run represents a climate without any anthropogenic influence. In the future experiment, the model reproduces most of features of current climate including the summer rainfall maximum over South Asia as well as the southwards shift of monolithic summer rain band and its weakening and southward shifting. However, in this future scenario the monolith is replaced with two rain bands. This leads to the weakening of summer precipitation over the western India.",225,187,0.5212121212121212,6.695090919789098,0.8723844230264962,0.05754971859277353,0.8266666666666667,0.834042553191489,0.7729061139624287,50.599999999999994,47.21212121212121,47.388194444444444

Abstract:
The paper examines the impact of climate variability on inter – state internal migrant flows in the Indian subcontinent.

Main Article Content
Abstract
The North-East region of India is highly diverse in nature. It comprises a large number of tribal and indigenous communities which live in the forests and have very limited interaction with the rest of the world. This region is also known in history for its resistance against external invasion which was one of its characteristics. The NorthEast India comprises the states of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. Climate change is a global issue of great concern to the scientific fraternity, policy makers and the general public. There is consensus among the experts that climate change will have a significant impact on the NorthEastern region. India, as a whole is vulnerable to climate variability and extremes. North Eastern states are more vulnerable because of their unique geographic and ecological character and their limited capacity to cope with climate hazards and disasters.

Abstract. Crop models have been used widely to study the impact of climate variability (CV) on crop yield. In this paper, we use a yield gap approach to quantify crop production loss due to variability in precipitation and temperature in Punjab state of India. The impact is studied using the model, the “Crop Yield Gap Model”. This model is a hybrid crop model that is based on the process based crop modelling system ”POWER”. A hybrid model approach was chosen as it combines the advantages of a mechanistic crop growth model and a stochastic crop water model. For the study, daily precipitation data and monthly mean maximum and minimum temperature for the crop seasons in the period 1981 to 2010 were used. We used 2 sets of precipitation ",231,196,0.489247311827957,6.672443733471575,0.8631990389445376,0.060277673852441725,0.8514285714285714,0.8385185185185189,0.7577289625753353,46.667386531995064,52.22043010752688,46.175934696606674

Abstract
The impacts of climate change on human societies have been studied extensively over the last decades. Climate change research has focused mainly on impacts from the direct effects of the changes in the global climate. However, climate changes affect human society in many more ways. These impacts are caused by the complex interplay between changes that occur in nature (such as temperature and precipitation) and changes caused in society, such as changes to agriculture patterns in response to changes of temperature, changes associated with water supply, energy demands and other factors that impact our daily lives. The interactions between these ‘above’and’ ’below’ factors can lead to the amplification and/or attenuation of a given climate signal, resulting in changes above and below what might be observed for a particular climate perturbation. It is this phenomenon that makes the impact of changing climate on our human systems difficult to predict.

The Indian summer monsoon plays a critical role in the climate system of the northern Indian ocean. The monsoons are highly variable over this ocean region, and climate predictions for the coming decades are largely uncertain. In this study, we analyse the seasonal cycle of rainfall, surface temperatures and atmospheric stability, in two high-resolution climate model simulations of summer over an area spanning 20° N–10° S and 30° E–80° W, for two contrasting monsole conditions, wet and dry years. These model runs were carried out under the same climate forcing (the atmospheric general circulation model HadGEM1-ES-L40), which has been used by the IPCC, but at two resolutions, the Hadley Centre’s 1.6 km grid, which is used in many climate studies, compared to their coarser 6.5 km resolution. Both models exhibit a strong summer seasonality",238,191,0.5955056179775281,7.945035903356131,0.8999679451777178,0.04445039357970997,0.8857142857142856,0.8670129870129866,0.8126648119404026,70.71762313104661,70.15168539325843,66.80024968789013

Abstract:This study is conducted to determine the relationship between job satisfaction and organizational stress and climate at the organizational level. Data was gathered through questionnaire from 100 personnel in three different grades from an Indian company. Results indicate that job dissatisfaction is related negatively with organizational commitment and satisfaction. Organizational commitment was found to be an important mediator between occupational stressors and job stress. Occupational stressors are significantly related with job anxiety. It is found that the level of job demand, control and social support are found as the major sources of stress at workplace.

Abstract
The climate profile of a person is the unique combination of the climate factors that are most prevalent at the place of birth of that person. This paper presents the profile, of climate of Indian teachers, based on the meteorological data of 12 weather stations from the 1993 to 2016 time period. The profile is generated from 1 to the maximum of seven different climate variables (temperature, mean relative humidity, maximum daily temperature, minimum daily air temperature and maximum relative temperature). The data for 7,000 teachers across India was used to compute OCA-based climate profiles and to find the most common climate factor for teachers’ location based. We also computed the OBCs using 3 variables: ‘temperature’, “relative humidity’ and ’maximum temperature’.

The Indian subcontinent is a key area in global monsoonal processes. The monolithic South Asian summer monologue is driven by atmospheric circulation and oceanic processes over the western Indian ocean (WIO). Recent observations indicate that the WIO has been changing over recent decades and a substantial warming has occurred. However, it is still poorly understood how the monologues are affected by a warming Wio and how this might lead to changes in the seasonal monolology over Asia. Using the Australian Bureau of Meterology/BoM sea-surface temperature analysis 1958–2004, we investigated the variability of temperature in different regions around the south west monolith and in a north east monogogue.

The Indian sub-continent has one of the world’s most diverse agricultural systems. However, the region’ s agricultural productivity is highly variable, and its climate has been getting drier and warmer during the last century. We examine the impact of climate change using the ‘global climate model’ GFDL CM2.2 coupled with a 3-dimensional climate-vegetation model (CLM4). In our simulations, we have used the output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 – Phase5c (‘CMIP5’). We analyse the climate response to greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol perturbations in the model, using two different scenarios : “A2”, which is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change 7th Assessment Report ",245,188,0.6242038216560509,7.821251467782697,0.9067928370532866,0.04244600286923451,0.8666666666666667,0.8803007518796989,0.8193066873149303,72.14886731391586,76.86624203821655,64.98087912087912

The aim of this paper is to examine the coverage of the climate crisis in the main newspapers in India. The study aims to identify how and to what extent the newspapers have addressed the issues of global warming and climate breakdown. We have conducted a discourse study of newspaper articles on climate related issues in four newspapers – The Indian Express, Mint, The Hindu and The New Indian express. A total of 60 articles were analyzed using a critical discourse approach to analyze the language used in news stories about climate and environmental issues. This is in contrast to the dominant coverage which has been on mitigation and adaptation measures and other issues related to sustainability.

Abstract
Cotton is one of the major commercial fibers in the textile industry. It is also the most important natural fiber for textile and clothing in China, India, and many other developing countries. Climate change and variability are likely to influence cotton productivity in these regions in future. The objective of this study is to simulate the potential impacts on the production of cotton, based on a global gridded data set of temperature and precipitation, which was developed as part of a previous project. For this purpose, the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the Noah-MP land surface model were used. Results suggest that the area suitable for the cultivation of all three main types of cottons in cotton-producing areas (P. ginseng L., G. arboreum L. and Gossypium barbadense L.) may decrease by 2–3% by the year 2050–2070 due to climate-change-induced temperature rises and associated reductions",248,198,0.572972972972973,7.793274994194362,0.893318243118437,0.047054996119199666,0.8628571428571429,0.853664596273292,0.8044174013658287,66.60733296361309,66.83243243243243,60.008578431372555

In this article we explore whether climate conditions affect wheat crop in the country
The wheat-growing region of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab is likely to get more extreme heat waves as temperatures continue to rise because of global warming and climate changes, a study has said.
According to research by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the region will also experience longer and stronger heatwaves as well as more frequent droughts. This will likely lead to lower wheat yields as heat stress affects plant growth. Wheat accounts for 90 per cent of total cereal production of the three states. It will become even more important in coming years when India will import food grains to fill the supply-demand gap. As a consequence, the cost of food items will go up, especially the staple, wheat. “We found that wheat production in Punjab will be affected by higher temperatures, whereas the wheat growing areas in Hryana",249,196,0.5979381443298969,8.328314639965763,0.9023762689828375,0.042671412360606904,0.9199999999999999,0.9054117647058828,0.8296139083661087,83.67582417582418,85.84536082474227,104.21860809934205

The World Bank estimated the cost of climate change in 2005 for India to be $10-20 billion per year by 2030. The cost is expected to increase to 7-14% of GDP by the end of the 21st century. India is the second most populous nation in the world and the sixth most vulnerable to climate-related impacts. In the last few years, there were 2,500 climate disasters and 3 billion people were affected by them in different ways.

The aim of this study was to explore and analyse climatic and meteorological changes in the Indian sector of the western Indian ocean during 1985-2008. This was in view of developing a long term trend of meteorology. A total of 12 stations in south east Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar and Mauritius were used. The 10 selected stations showed similar trends for the 30 years period. There was a decrease in annual average rainfall at 6 stations. On the other hand at the remaining 5 stations there was either no change or an increase in rainfall, with the highest being at Maputo, the capital of Mozambique (0.4 mm to 2 mm p.a). The decrease ranged from 0 mm in Maputa to over 100",251,197,0.5932203389830508,7.892283294029704,0.8991162525438291,0.04487764555111658,0.8628571428571429,0.8478431372549016,0.8095252517391976,64.08022208240743,65.28248587570621,55.385286873370035
Indian climate,The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change,"The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change. We used a model of the global dispersal of mammals to estimate the impact of climate warming on the spread of this species. Our results show that the species is unlikely to expand outside its range unless the climate warms by at least 2.3oC. Climate warming beyond these values would cause the mongose to reach areas with suitable temperature but the lack of suitable prey would limit its expansion further. This is the first time a species has been assessed for its climate suitability by combining global climate and prey species distribution data. The results suggest that climate is a better predictor of range expansion than prey availability in this invasive species, a finding that highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in the assessment of global change impact.
Introduction
The global distribution of species and the processes that control the extent of their range are key questions to address in order to understand the potential impact that global warming might have on species",252,180,0.5240641711229946,7.16646975644588,0.8764810319361075,0.05436953338142331,0.8742857142857143,0.8549693251533749,0.7716906913371716,59.022771248707066,54.83422459893048,54.23412624953721

As a child, I would spend my summer vacations in India, mostly with my maternal grandparents who lived in a village in West Bengal close to the Sundarban mangroves.
One morning I remember waking up to see a strange sight. A man was climbing a tree right outside the window, a small boat in tow and a long pole in his grip. My grandpa explained that it was a local fisherman who was out fishing. But, there was something strange about it. The fisherman was wearing a blue shirt with a white patch on his left shoulder, an Indian army uniform. I wondered why he would be up a big old tree in our compound, especially when the man in white was in full combat gear. He was not alone. Another man stood behind him, holding onto his rifle and peering over his shoulder to make sure the fisherman wasn’t going to fall down. And then a third one",262,187,0.5824742268041238,8.112927192380441,0.8974022602675605,0.044845555622325936,0.8971428571428571,0.875058823529411,0.8006564894271128,69.79688175305986,73.83505154639175,68.86229671423831

Abstract
The western and central Indian ocean coral reefs have been identified as one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change. However, information on the extent of species diversity and their response to environmental changes is currently lacking. We used the species richness of reef-building corals to estimate the diversity of coral communities. This was done by applying the Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H’) to 11 000 coral samples collected at 10 locations between 15°N and 25°S along the Indian east coast.

1. Introduction
The Indian ocean is a large (3.5×106 km2) semi-enclosed basin - with a narrow outlet – and is the largest ocean in area. It is also characterized by high latitudinal (~20°) and longitudinal (<10∘) gradients of the wind, temperature, salinity and depth which influence the ocean circulation. The mean wind stress curl is about three times larger than the mean wave energy flux [1]. The Indian monsoon is associated with an east-west dipole mode and a north-south asymmetry of about 2∕1 and 3∕�1 respectively. A number of studies have shown that the interannual to decadel variability of Indian summer monsoons is related to the ENSO, and that ERSO ",265,196,0.6,7.823042886243178,0.90053627882262,0.044593588413545826,0.8733333333333332,0.8684931506849314,0.8124445223510675,67.02508960573476,71.47647058823529,68.79391371340523

Abstract. The seasonal climate forecasts of the Nucleus for European Prediction (NCEPs) climate system are based on an extended version of its latest coupled atmosphere–ocean system, called version 2b, which includes a 20–90 day seasonal forecasting system. This forecasting model has been validated using a hindcasting period from 1960 to 2005 with respect to the observed precipitation and temperature. We examine in this study the performance of N2B for the seasonal Indian monsoons – the onset and the peak rainfall — using the latest hindcasts 1981–2010. It is found that Ncep's seasonal monsole forecasts have improved over the last 40 years.

This study examines how Indian commercial banks are responding to the risk of climate-related financial losses due to their exposure to energy and other infrastructure sectors that have a direct impact on the climate. It is found that most banks have yet to take any action to manage climate related risks to any material extent. However, this is likely to change rapidly as banks recognise the material impact of the risks and the growing expectations of stakeholders and regulators. The results also suggest that the Indian government should consider taking steps to incentivise banks in managing climate risks.

Indian climate,Climate models produce skillful predictions of Indian summer monsoon rainfall,"Climate models produce skillful predictions of Indian summer monsoon rainfall, but they fail to capture the extreme wet years, such as 2010.
The authors propose a possible way to improve model predictions: by considering the effect of a changing climate on the atmospheric circulation of the Indian monsoons. By adding more heat energy into the atmosphere, a warming planet would tend to intensify the circulation around the pole and weaken it at the equator, where the monosons blow into land masses (in the southern hemisphere, of course). This would cause a stronger poleward flow that would lead to a more intense Indian Monsoon during warm periods and a weaker polewards flow in cold periods, with less rainfall and fewer monson events. The authors tested this hypothesis with a coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model with and without this effect: the model without the extra heat showed the “normal” monsson patterns. But with the addition of extra energy the climate became more variable, and the",270,189,0.5519125683060109,7.466134836641186,0.8859070513747359,0.050428912758886765,0.857142857142857,0.8638993710691822,0.7944093416859683,60.79391891891892,65.22404371584699,67.53350248267583

This increase may be due to urbanization and industrialization, as well as the increasing anthropogenic activity. It is also found that rainfall has decreased during this period. Rainfall has declined by about 10 % from the 1950s to the late 1980's in this region.",271,192,0.592,6.618761213399377,0.8914220010087742,0.05177999929308776,0.8320000000000001,0.8728712871287135,0.7946193480741153,57.957848837209305,60.632,54.902872777017784

Indian forests are highly diverse in their composition and distribution, and the dynamic nature of the vegetation and its response to a changing climate presents a major challenge to the forestry community. Understanding how forests respond and adapt to different environmental conditions is a crucial aspect of conservation and sustainable use of forests. The objective of this study is to evaluate the suitability of forest dynamics models to predict how the forests would respond to changes in climatic variables over the Indian region using observed data. We developed and validated a dynamic forest model using a set of 14 dynamic and structural parameters. Our analysis revealed that the performance of all the models improved when the model parameters were updated with new and improved data, especially when data of recent decades",272,200,0.5631578947368421,7.762595876177125,0.8905674474136437,0.04802298613619242,0.8628571428571429,0.8383132530120492,0.7994250505514163,56.790633608815426,61.189473684210526,55.408578196379224

Abstract/Description
The Himalayan region has been facing a plethora of natural hazards like floods, landslides and snow avalanches since centuries due to its fragile environment, which has also increased vulnerability and exposure of vulnerable communities. This is further accentuated by the climate variability and change. The present study, using the Climate Vectors Index (CVI), measures the vulnerability levels of Himalayan communities to climate volatility. CVI has five indicators, namely, the ‘temperature index’, 'precipitation",273,195,0.5891891891891892,8.013839380822503,0.8986643898280164,0.04469692741068358,0.8457142857142858,0.8578881987577637,0.7962140110429281,55.73717948717949,50.962162162162166,63.45726495726496

Abstract. The Indian ocean dipole (IOD) is a natural, long-lived mode of variability in the coupled ocean-atmosphere circulation of a region extending from the Bay of Bengal in South-East Asia through the Western Pacific to the East Coast of Africa. In the past, it has been identified as an important climate driver, with impacts on the interannual climate variability and extreme weather events in both the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere.
In the present study, the IOD is studied with a high-resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean model for 1950–2015. We find that a large part of model variability (~ 75 %) occurs in one of two distinct patterns, in which the maximum is located off the western coast of Australia",275,189,0.5879120879120879,7.931367688273783,0.8979290603269261,0.04516270601703134,0.8628571428571429,0.8572151898734166,0.7859009423098271,69.84206761056654,67.48351648351648,61.33053441791306

Abstract
Emerging Arbovirus Diseases (EADs): Aedes albopictus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue, Yellow Fever and Zika are considered to pose a growing risk to human and animal health worldwide. The increasing number of people moving between regions carrying the pathogens that cause them is likely to increase the spread. Climate change is a major determinant of the transmission of these diseases. This review aims at identifying and assessing the impact of various factors including climate on EADs. A search of peer-reviewed publications from 1964-2013 was undertaken in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation databases using the following key words: climate, vector, arboviruses, disease, dengue, chikengunia. We also searched the literature for the impacts of temperature on mosquito vectors in order to assess the influence of changing climate.

Abstract
The δ14 C, 210Pb, and the 137Cs ages of Indian sedimentary rocks are commonly used in paleoclimate reconstructions. These ages are interpreted from magnetic and density-sedimentation proxies, as they provide information about the sea level, sea temperature, productivity, etc. The δ13 C isotopic ratio of these rocks is also used for this purpose. In particular, the δ 13C values from Indian sediment cores and sedimentalites are often used as a climate reconstruction tool. However, there has been little work done on these proxies in order to understand how they are formed. This study presents a detailed investigation of sediment composition, δC and δD of sedimnetialites, their isotope fractionation patterns, sedimentation rates and sediment flux in the western Indian basin.

Abstract
The study focuses on the wave climate along 11 sites along Tamil-Nadu coast of India for the period 2002–2010. Wave data are used in conjunction with the 3-dimensional (3D) wind fields from the National Data Buoy Center buoy 42002 to compute wave height and significant wave heights. The wave data from 4 sites are analysed for different seasons. A wave energy analysis is undertaken for 6 sites in the study to find out the maximum and annual averages of wave power generated. These 2 methods are found to give different results. For example at Kanyakumari, the values obtained by using wave analysis are about 1.7 times that obtained from wave measurements. This is due to the presence of",278,193,0.6049382716049383,7.699607172920184,0.9012050439062883,0.044713412420128856,0.8866666666666667,0.8713043478260867,0.8019392221348794,56.91330858960764,63.18518518518518,55.07845794392523
Indian climate,Climate change contributes to more frequent consecutive positive Indian Ocean Dipole events,"Climate change contributes to more frequent consecutive positive Indian Ocean Dipole events, which cause heavy rains and floods in Southeast Asia
A new study published in Geophysical Research Letters has found that human-induced climate change has contributed to a trend increase in consecutive negative Indian Dipolar events (IDPs) — a period of alternating positive and negative dipolar regions of the Indian and Pacific Ocean. Researchers found a strong correlation between the IDPs and the frequency and intensity of consecutive extreme rainy seasons in the Southeast Asian region since the 1990s.
Consecutive negative IDP events are linked to extreme rainfall and flooding in this region as they increase the probability of a second extreme IDM following consecutive dry years. These second negative events often occur with a lag of several months, but are often larger than the first ones.. As the region experiences an increased probability for a wet year following a dry period, the number of extreme events is likely to increase. The researchers found",279,183,0.5642458100558659,7.549094436794552,0.8896813712303504,0.0489684090584754,0.9199999999999999,0.9068387096774181,0.8146590904558716,69.37799142083082,74.54748603351955,65.16741182314954

Abstract. The seasonal cycle and interannual variability of rainfall over East Asia and India have important impacts on the monsoon rainfall and circulation over the western Pacific Ocean. A monoslope and multidomain regional ocean–atmosphere modelling experiment is performed to study how monolithic and monomodel responses to changes in sea-level pressure, temperature, and precipitation in East and Western Pacific are altered through the inclusion of a topographic uplift in the Himalayas. Two different versions are used, where the topography of the Tibetan Plateau is either modelled by using the ""topography-only"" approach or by including the effects of topographical uplift on sea level through a dynamic topogra- phy (DT). The DT is found to reduce the mean rainfall in summer over China and the Korean",280,181,0.5882352941176471,7.669649888473704,0.8966804757690342,0.04632230007182633,0.8999999999999999,0.8723287671232881,0.815649674349008,78.56060606060606,74.23529411764706,65.21052631578948

Abstract
The relationship between past and present sea surface temperatures and sea level rise (SLR) and their impact on coral reefs were investigated using coral growth rates [1, 2] and coral bleaching ([1], 3) from 10 coral reef monitoring sites around the Indian ocean. The 20th century SSTs and SLR were obtained from NOAA data and were compared with coral data collected between 1981 and 1997. A 1.0 °C warming and a 4 cm SL rise are estimated for the 21st century. These predicted SL rises are similar in magnitude to historical coral cover declines observed in 1961 (-2.9%),1966 -(2%), and in recent decades.
Corals at sites with high coral loss (>50%) experienced the highest SSTA. In sites where coral losses were low (<30%) the SSTE showed little correlation with the",281,199,0.5668449197860963,7.751487695747585,0.8914819851162156,0.04776654084138547,0.8514285714285714,0.8498159509202451,0.8127008235212582,45.34862110311751,52.99465240641711,53.96762141967621

The impact of the climate and the associated sea-level rise is being witnessed throughout the world, even in low-lying countries. The Indian coastline is also no exception. It is well documented that the Indian coastal areas have been witnessing the negative effects of global warming and climate changes over the last few decades. Sea-water temperature has increased and is projected to increase further in future. As a consequence, the intensity of extreme weather events such as cyclones, heatwave, monsoon and drought are projected (IPCC, IPCC Special Report on Managing of Global Warming, SRREN/IPPC, 2011).",284,197,0.6055555555555555,8.124380318249235,0.903405904754422,0.04283034313015466,0.8457142857142858,0.8274358974358972,0.8088340386914263,63.50117479728647,62.73888888888889,46.32030710835059

Abstract. The Indian mon-soon system is highly sensitive to small-scale atmospheric perturbations and the associated large- scale atmospheric circulations. A significant fraction of the mon–soon rainfall and circulation variability can be attributed to internal variability in the atmosphere. However, the extent of internal and external variability is not understood well yet.
In order to assess the relative contributions of these internal/external forcings in driving the regional/global climate system, it is essential to study the role of both the external as well as the internal components. In the current study we have performed an intercomparison of 12 regional atmosphere model simulations of Indian summer climate and their impacts on the winter Indian Monsoon using an atmospheric General Circulation Model.

The Tibetan plateau is considered a major driver of regional climate on a global scale. The Tibetan and Asian monsoons, the latter of which is driven by a complex interplay between the westerly monoswell and summer monocyclone, both of whose impacts are modulated by the summer Asian high, have been linked to monolithic Tibetan glaciation events, most notably those at the Last Glacial Maximum (~23–18 ka cal BP) and Holocene. However, it remains an open question as to how and to what extend the monoscale and synoptic processes are coupled, a question particularly pertinent to the Asian summer.

Climate change will affect agriculture worldwide, with significant implications for food security, rural livelihoods and biodiversity, especially if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. The livestock sector is a major driver for change and a key area for intervention. There are many pathways by which livestock production impacts climate: through emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the digestive system, through the use of land and water resources, and through land-use change.
Livestock production has been shown to contribute to climate impacts through:
- GHG emissions;

Abstract. The Indian Bengal Delta is a densely populated delta region which is highly vulnerable to flooding due to its low geographical position, high precipitation and tidal range.

We apply the PRECIS model to evaluate the simulated climatology of monsoonal rainfall over South Asia. This includes both the mean climatological conditions and the variability in precipitation. To evaluate and assess the impact of the model's representation on its ability to reproduce the climatologies of seasonal monosonal precipitation, we apply PREGIS-Mon, a monograph by Kummerow et al. [2008, hereafter K08] to the observed precipitation from a large number of stations across South and Southeast Asia during 1971–2000 for validation, and a subset of 50 stations to assess model biases. The validation results indicate that the simulations of PRECG-SST are reasonably good over land and sea.
The simulations for the entire Indian region are evaluated for mean seasonal climatologists.

The present study investigates the impact of projected future change in climate in South Asia, with a focus on South and Southeast Asia and the Bay of Bengal, on the onset and retreat of Indian monsoons through an assessment of a regional atmospheric climate and hydrological model (WRFv3-India-IH) under the A2-B2 scenario of Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change 2030-2060 emission scenarios. Using the 2000 to 2013 climatological analysis period, a seasonal cycle of precipitation is simulated and found to be in good agreement with observations for the two monolithic regions of South, and South East Asia. The seasonal analysis of 1.25° × 2.5° grid box in each region showed a robust seasonal variation of both precipitation and temperature over the monoliths of India (>",293,191,0.5568181818181818,7.387027942155209,0.8867578901840775,0.05043040346156488,0.8857142857142858,0.8571052631578946,0.7959261543036452,54.44809532406572,61.05681818181818,57.55826271186441

Abstract. We investigated the relationship between climate extremes, such as high-impact weather and the summer monsoon, and climate variability in summer of 2022. In summer, extreme weather conditions such high temperatures and high precipitation often accompany each other. For example, in 1996, a strong high pressure area formed over East Asia and caused the record-breaking heat over Korea and Japan. During the heat-wave event from June to July in this year, high temperature was observed in East Asian countries. A high rainfall event was also observed over Japan during the same period.

Description
This paper examines the relationship between the climate and the imperial landscape and examines how these are intertwined in the construction of British colonial hill stations in Northeast India. It focuses on how colonial administrators in colonial India created and shaped the image of an ideal mountain environment for the consumption of European tourists in order to enhance the appeal of their hill resorts for visitors. Using colonial photographs as visual documents, the paper demonstrates how the “picturesque” was constructed to appeal to the senses",297,195,0.581151832460733,8.03167811874588,0.89666508528743,0.0453017988234222,0.8057142857142857,0.8009580838323351,0.7804072726985801,45.42394397925321,43.42931937172775,37.89097515236756

Abstract
The Indian State of Gujarat is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and variability, owing to its coastal and deltaic nature and its high population density and agricultural dependence. As a result, Gujarat’s population is highly dependent on natural resources, especially on the state’ s water resources and on agriculture. This study assesses the adaptation strategies of a smallholder farming community in the coastal district of Saurashtra, which are currently being employed to respond to and reduce their vulnerability to a changing climate. Using an integrated social-ecological system perspective, the study examines the adaptive capacity of the community to reduce the vulnerability of smallscale farmers through changes in their livelihoods and in natural resource use. The community is engaged in multiple livelihoods, including farming, fishing, livestock raising, and forest-based activities. Their adaptation responses fall under four broad categories.

Abstract
This book is an outcome of a collaborative effort among experts on climate and inland fishes of the Ganges Basin. The objective of this book was to review the status of freshwater fisheries of river Gange in the face of changing climate; review impact studies in relation to climate variables on freshwater fishes; understand the current state of knowledge regarding impacts of various climate-driven variables; identify gaps in current knowledge; and make recommendations for future research. We have also reviewed the available models, models in development, and model applications, to assess how well they address the needs of inland fishery management. Climate-related changes have had profound effects on the distribution and diversity of fishes & their habitats in many regions of India, including the Gangetic Plains (Chowdhury et al., 2007).

Abstract
This paper investigates the role of El Niño (EN) and the Indian-summer monsoon on the North American summer monsoonal circulation using the Nucleus for European Modeling of the Ocean–Atmosphere–Land System 1/4 degree climate prediction system. The model was run with and without ENSO and Iod. In addition, the IDA model with ESDM forcing was used as controls. A strong IDO is found to be a necessary component for summer rainfall in the US Midwest and central United States. This summer IENO-driven circulation is characterized by the northward displacement of low pressure systems and westward intensification of high pressure. It also results in more northwesterly winds and stronger southward winds in mid-latitudes than the control run. However, a weak EEN + IES circulation pattern can be identified in July 2015 in our model.

Abstract:The paper examines the effects of investment and other factors on manufacturing labour productivity using panel and panel-econometric methods, based on data collected for the 1992-1993 period. We estimate the effect of manufacturing investment using the method of least squares and the instrumental variable methods. The panel data method estimates an aggregate production function for manufacturing. Our results show that investment has a significant effect on productivity for Indian manufacturing firms. This implies that there is room for investment to increase productivity of the manufacturing sector in India, provided the government and local authorities do their part to encourage investment in this sector.

Abstract
This research aims to evaluate the hydrological response of a large urban drainage basin in the Indian city, Thiraunanthapurm, under various climate change scenarios. The drainage system of the Thriunathanthpuram consists of 12 sub-basins and a main channel. These subchannels are linked to a stormwater pumping system, which pumps out the water from the basin to the sea. A 4D-2Q2C model is used to perform hydrologic analysis of subbasin level. This model was calibrated by using the observed discharge data for 2006 to 2015, and validated against observed discharges and streamflow for the period 1993–2005. To simulate the future discharge, 20th -century CMIP5 climate simulations were used. Three climate downscaling techniques were adopted.

Indian climate,European climate leadership in question: policies toward China and India,"European climate leadership in question: policies toward China and India
The European Union has long been an environmental policy role model. But now China, which will likely become the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter within a few years, is making rapid strides to catch up. And in India, where energy use is skyrocketing, emissions growth is also a serious problem. The question for Europe’S environmental leadership is how to deal with the two biggest emitting developing countries.
A paper for the European Commission by Ecologic Institute and the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP) argues that Europe could be a powerful force in addressing the climate change challenges in these countries, but that it needs to take a new approach. “Europe cannot be just a bystander and should use its influence to shape climate policy,” says SWP researcher and paper author Dr. Ulrich Körner. Krünner argues in the paper that a ‘business-as-usual’ approach to emissions reductions would mean that the EU",309,198,0.6073298429319371,8.39346542139209,0.9050538316841341,0.04162419089486051,0.9485714285714285,0.919281437125749,0.8405590485555912,84.99780058651027,93.57591623036649,87.6592731829574

Abstract
This dissertation aims at identifying and understanding farmer's perceptions on climate-change and its impacts and strategies for adaptation in a freshwater ecosystem. Farmers' responses were studied in two contrasting climatic regions, namely the Sundarbans mangrove-marsh region of Bangladesh and Manú River system of Peru. The Sundara-ban region experiences the adverse impacts of both sea-level rise and salinity intrusion. While the Maná region is threatened by both climate extremes and climate variability. In both cases, there has been observed significant changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. Climate-driven changes and extreme events like droughts and floods have impacted on farming systems and livelihoods. Adaptation strategies have varied in both regions.",310,187,0.5363128491620112,7.175376890418584,0.879893719554962,0.05331296750982329,0.8628571428571429,0.860129032258065,0.7884826973680076,60.55112124667427,62.815642458100555,62.457797220792585
Indian climate,Fluctuations in all-India summer monsoon rainfall during 18711978,"Fluctuations in all-India summer monsoon rainfall during 18711978: a review
Abstract
The variability and extremes in rainfall are of interest to researchers in various disciplines and fields of studies. Rainfall is an important climatic phenomenon, especially in a semi-arid region as India, where its variability has a significant impact on agricultural production, socio-economic activities, energy generation, water supply and availability of drinking water and so on. The review is aimed at providing a brief overview of the summer season rainfall variations at various sites across India over the past two centuries based on published and unpublished sources of data. A detailed analysis on the inter-annual variability of precipitation has been done for 16 stations across the country. It has also been found that summer rainfall is highly variable and exhibits a wide spread of variability in different parts of India during the period (1871-78). It is also observed that the maximum rainfall variability occurs between 1920 to 1950, while the minimum occurred between the years 193",311,191,0.578125,8.010734985006058,0.8957744834867823,0.045646853425641336,0.9028571428571428,0.8949999999999999,0.8124922327793742,73.30959136709936,72.3125,74.93060869565218

Abstract
The monthly pan evaporation (MPE) over the central Indian Himalaya was estimated over a period of twelve years 2005–16 and compared with four different models: 1) the Penman-Monteith model 2) The Priestley-Taylor model, 3) Thornthwaite “C” method and 4) Penalosa & Rojas model. Daily MPEs were estimated from 15 weather data sites using the four models. The results of the monthly MPA were compared and evaluated by using coefficient of determination [r2] and mean absolute percentage error [%MAPE] for different seasons as well as for all seasons. Results indicated the Thornton Taylor ‘C’ model performed best with respect to MPe estimation.",312,180,0.6095890410958904,7.365692408561075,0.9006803125631683,0.04588886103825005,0.8320000000000001,0.8540983606557377,0.8300554495549137,67.79876302684727,70.46575342465754,61.65861344537815

In the Indian Himalayas, water resources are very much dependent on the monsoon, which is influenced by global warming. The Teesto River is a tributary of river Ganga and originates in the Himalaya region near Gangotri Glacier with the elevation of 3,600 m and flows down towards the Gangetic Plains. A comprehensive study was done to investigate the impact of global change over the water balance and hydrological regime of Teest River Basin for two different time periods from 1901 to 2005 and 1986 to1995.

Abstract –
Indian subcontinent is highly vulnerable to climate change with its tropical climate and large monsoonal precipitation. This paper examines the temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events in last century using instrumental and historical records in a number of stations in southern part of India and shows its sensitivity and vulnerability. The results show the mean and median of monthly and annual temperatures are increasing in most of the stations. Mean temperatures have increased up to 0.5 to1.6 °C in 1911 to present in Southern Peninsular India. Precipitation has also increased in all the southern stations and also in north India stations, which shows a trend towards more frequent heavy precipitation events.

Abstract: The authors of this paper attempt to simulate the impact on the wheat crop of climate scenarios for the next 30 years, with an emphasis on temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. They also attempt an assessment of the crop response to climate changes using the FAO-60 model. Their findings indicate that, if climate conditions continue to be as projected, wheat production in 2000 will be 10–15% lower than it was in the 1990s. However, there is little difference between their findings and other analyses of impacts of future climate on global wheat yields.

In the context of emerging variability and climate change, this project investigates how to ensure that agriculture remains sustainable in the face of changing climatic conditions. To this end three questions are addressed:
- What is the state of agricultural sustainability in a changing climate in different parts of India and what are the key factors affecting it?
The study is conducted on two sites with contrasting climatic and socioeconomic conditions in northern and southern India. Climate-related risks (such as droughts, floods, frost, pest attacks) are assessed using climate data and historical observations, and the impact of these events on agricultural production are quantified.
A survey of local experts is carried out to investigate the adaptation strategies employed by Indian farmers and to gain further insights into how climate impacts affect farmers’ livelihoods. Furthermore, climate information and risk management tools are developed for farmers in cooperation with local research institutes.",319,195,0.5602094240837696,7.742248276628912,0.8896773746601717,0.048365195759035494,0.8857142857142858,0.8934131736526927,0.8093372581946343,68.32104823797431,78.90575916230367,73.1825912183055

The data is analysed using 2-dimensional spectral and wavelet analysis techniques. A significant increase of wave heights and frequencies is observed in all these regions. In general, significant variability is found for wind and wind-wave climate parameters, such as wave height and period, wind speed at 50,60 and 70 m height, and their corresponding spectral parameters - wave steepness, wave periodicity and significant wave amplitude for all three regions in both hemispheres. However, there are differences in variability of wind, temperature and salinity for the three areas.

Background
A significant part of climate change impact and mitigation efforts depend on the understanding of changes in Ocean, Sea-surface Temperature, ocean heat content, sea level, salinity etc. The Indian and Western coasts of Africa are particularly vulnerable to climate changes due to its proximity to Indian/Western Oceans. This vulnerability has been recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes. A sustained Ocean observing System can be used to help understand climate variations. Ocean observation and monitoring are essential for a sustainable development, particularly for coastal regions. Such a system will have to be designed and developed",324,183,0.5608465608465608,7.710365455005064,0.889672676058939,0.048464386153462956,0.9142857142857143,0.8913939393939387,0.8098993555229388,83.03155339805825,76.14814814814815,78.50964912280702
Indian climate,Assessment on vulnerability of sorghum to climate change in India,"Assessment on vulnerability of sorghum to climate change in India with special reference to heatwaves
Sorghums is a staple crop of millions of farmers in Indian semi-arid tropics (SAT) where they are cultivated in rotation with rice and wheat. The crop has the potential to contribute to the livelihoods and food security of the region. However, the crop productivity, which is dependent on the weather condition, is highly susceptible to adverse weather events such as heat stress. Heat waves are projected to increase significantly in number, frequency, and intensity in the coming decades. To assess the vulnerability, we developed a crop model “SVM” to forecast crop yield for sorhums. In SVM, crop water productivity (%CPW) was the most sensitive parameter to temperature. Increasing heat wave temperature had significant effect on sorgum grain yield in all the 16 locations. SOMs analysis revealed that sorgo was more vulnerable to extreme heat waves,",325,184,0.5828571428571429,7.710475249388236,0.8954819883409099,0.04659662894274325,0.88,0.8529801324503304,0.7900335562028439,60.50018628084424,61.86857142857143,45.138817273606186

Abstract. A numerical model is used to investigate the impact of the increasing temperature on the occurrence of tropical-cyclones (TCs) along the Indian Coasts. The study focuses on a 10-member 40 year 20th Century reanalysis data set from the NOAA/National Climate Data Center. This data was supplemented with the latest available satellite sea surface temperature data of 2013 from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, United States.
Results indicate that the frequency of TCs has shown a gradual decrease, which was attributed to the increase in wind shear and decrease in sea-surface temperature. It is observed that TC occurrence is reduced due to increasing frequency in the formation of easterly waves. These eastery waves are formed in response to increased heat and moisture in",326,196,0.5824175824175825,7.857242756607673,0.896124731294614,0.04596105647706733,0.8857142857142858,0.8926582278481003,0.8181024281337784,65.62685020108628,73.82967032967034,79.26992753623188

Abstract.
The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is a natural oscillating pattern of the Atlantic Ocean. It is the strongest atmospheric pattern in Africa that is associated with large-scale climate variations such as the African monsoons. NAO is also a dominant pattern over Asia and Europe and thus has strong impacts on global climates, including the East Asian summer monograph. However, its impacts of African climate have been scarcely investigated. To investigate the role of NAOs in the monosomonal climate system of Africa, a comprehensive statistical analysis based on the 30 years 1972–2001 of monthly mean atmospheric circulation and precipitation data, as well as of surface air temperature [0–2 km] and sea level pressure data (< 300 hPa) was conducted for 11 stations over the continent.

Abstract. The tropical Pacific Ocean, especially the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean and the Bay of Bengal, is of great importance to climate research because it contributes significantly to the Earth's atmospheric circulation. In a recent study, we investigated the impact of using high-resolution regional model output in a low-order dynamical downscaling model (LODsDM) as a source term for the generation of cyclones for a climate experiment of the South Indian monsoon. We found that regional models with a spatial resolution of about 10° latitude × 7.5° longitude are able to reproduce features of a synoptic cyclonic circulation that are of importance for this climate. However, in terms of their representation of vorticities in these cyclons they are not able, or only partially able in some simulations, to",328,195,0.5752688172043011,7.845620653642402,0.8941935241460117,0.04662078536434592,0.8514285714285714,0.8570370370370374,0.7976576501172232,66.11876722377525,57.715053763440864,57.5974944182585
Indian climate,Climatic zones and rural housing in India,"Climatic zones and rural housing in India: implications for rural poverty reduction strategies
This paper examines the relationship between climatic zones, rural household poverty and the type of housing. It uses a nationally representative data set on households from India's Rural Household Survey (RHS). The empirical results indicate that households residing in the tropical zone are poorer and have lower access to sanitation, education and improved health facilities as compared to households in other climatic regions. However, the results of the multinomial logit analysis show that the association between the climatic zone and poverty depends, to a large extent, on the nature of household housing - i.e. whether the household is urban'slum' dwelling or rural dwelling. The results suggest that rural ""non-slums"" and slums are the poorest, and urban dwelling is the richest. A policy recommendation from the paper is that to reduce rural and, in particular, slum-related poverty, housing improvement, especially in non-",329,191,0.5138121546961326,6.912635560098647,0.8719057577396702,0.05673714747802482,0.8628571428571428,0.865732484076434,0.7627155805726682,57.12411347517731,54.552486187845304,53.89901004728132

Abstract
Climate change is predicted to cause significant health impacts in the future, with India being particularly vulnerable to these impacts due to its high population, high poverty, poor health infrastructure, and dependence on agriculture, fisheries, forestry, etc. The objective of this study was to review literature on the current evidence of the impacts of global warming in health of people in developing countries. A literature search was conducted using PubMed. Studies with the key word ‘climate change’ were included. We also included reviews of impact of different climate related events that had occurred in past. Most studies on climate-related impacts on human health had been carried out in temperate regions. These studies indicated that climate variability and climate extremes have the potential to affect the burden of several communicable and non-communicable diseases. It was found that the health burden due climate variations is likely to be greater among the vulnerable people, the poor, elderly and women. There were also reports of changes in some non communiable",331,197,0.48292682926829267,6.914459928118824,0.8632559150073892,0.05915166285486864,0.825,0.8265193370165752,0.7641249814268519,46.004225525188374,44.47317073170732,42.78030814215025

Abstract
The western and central Indian Oceans support a substantial longline fishery for yellow-fin and alb-fished tuna, but the effects of the El Niño Southern Oscillation [ENSO] on this fisher- ies distribution are largely unknown. We used data from a time-series of fisher surveys to examine the relation of ENSO to tuna distribution, and to explore the relationship between tuna biomass and E NSO. EN-SO was defined as the difference between the SSTs for January, April and July, 1998-2008. A generalized linear model - a type II-model – was fitted to a count of tuna sightings, using generalized additive models {GAM) and Bayesian inference. The GAM model showed strong evidence that E 1",332,200,0.6075268817204301,8.285561998706461,0.9046339430290931,0.04202049484400296,0.8857142857142858,0.8822222222222221,0.8204731240511931,74.70355613532598,73.5,69.69015525758644

Indian climate,Extreme heat in India and anthropogenic climate change,"Extreme heat in India and anthropogenic climate change are linked
In India, the heat wave that began in early April 2016, resulted in over 2,000 deaths and was associated with a number of heatstroke cases. As the death toll increased with the passage of time, media coverage of the disaster increased and it became clear that the deaths were largely attributable to the effects of extreme heat and not of any other cause. A heatwave, which is a period of unusually high temperatures, has been associated in some studies with mortality, but the causal relationship is not fully understood. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the national weather forecasting agency has now published an analysis of a heat-death cluster that occurred during a 10-day period in mid-April 2106. This heat cluster was found to have been linked to climate and the IMD has also linked the cluster to extreme climate.

Abstract
A multicomponent, multiscale approach has been proposed for ranking climate change models. The approach involves using 10 climate parameters for evaluating the model performance. In the present study of climate modelling for the country India, the ranking is done for a set of 16 global and regional climate model runs from a pool of over 40 models using the “Multiscenario Approach to Climate Change (MASCC)” developed by the World Climate Research Programme. For the India study, a 100-year time window from 1961 to 2100 has chosen for climate projections. Using this method, we have ranked the models in descending order with respect to different performance measures. It shows that the performance of the Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (“SST”) and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (""AMOC”) have been assessed to be very poor and their scores are the",335,182,0.5459770114942529,7.201931413999582,0.882695886646897,0.05235507027708387,0.8533333333333334,0.8578666666666667,0.7841143260654575,57.51828008265777,60.62068965517241,59.59750288129082

Abstract
We reconstruct past changes of summer climate (June–August) over 0.5 degrees of longitude and 30 degrees in longitudes 50–70 degrees N latitude during 70–0 kyr using the stable isotope composition and oxygen composition of a sediment core from the North Atlantic. We demonstrate that the intensity of the summer rainfall over the north-eastern Eurasia and the Arctic Ocean is controlled by climate change on the Asian continent and that this climatic signal is well preserved in sediment isotopes, which are also influenced by regional climate processes. In the last 40 k years, the monsoonal precipitation in north eastern Asia and in Arctic increased during summer, while it decreased in Eurasian high-latitude areas. The decrease of monosonal summer precipitation over Eurasians high latitudes was probably caused by increasing arctic sea ice. This change in mononso",337,182,0.563953488372093,7.396180661131327,0.8887257672853978,0.04977535976718621,0.86,0.8643243243243242,0.8040693514020254,64.22770855765779,66.29651162790698,68.45977011494253

Abstract
The paper studies the extent of passive adaptation among rural farmers in India. The passive adaptive capacity among the Indian rural populations has been found to be relatively higher than the global average. However the passive capacity is found relatively low among those in the rural poor and vulnerable group. This implies that the vulnerable populations may face more severe impacts of climate shocks due to their relatively less ability to deal with climate variability. It is observed that rural households which are vulnerable, are more passive in their coping and adaptation strategies and the coping ability declines with increasing vulnerability. A higher passive coping capacity of Indian poor is attributed to greater household savings and access to social safety net.",338,200,0.5034013605442177,6.103417131433186,0.8624633272488291,0.06345940695719646,0.8480000000000001,0.8452032520325207,0.7556789279511599,45.826424870466326,46.156462585034014,43.67280564263323

Abstract
Understanding and predicting the effects of climate and land‑use changes on hydrology is of increasing importance in water resources management. The use of Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) has emerged as a powerful approach for simulating complex interactions between multiple interacting agents to understand the impact of changes in the environment on the dynamics of hydrological systems. In this study, an ABM framework was developed to simulate the hydrologic and hydroclimatic dynamics in a catchments in India. It incorporated the interactions of water, land use and vegetation types. This study also included climate forcing based on observed and projected precipitation from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 - Coupling, version 4 1.0 2 [CMP5-C4.1] simulations.

Abstract
The Indian ocean dipoles (IODs) are a key mode of variability in the coupled ocean–atmosphere climate system, and they have a large impact on tropical climate. However, it is unclear how IOD variability will evolve under anthropogenic climate change. Here we show the results of a 22-model ensemble of simulations with the Community Climate System Model 5.0 to explore the impact of anthropogenically induced changes on the IDOs under three greenhouse gas concentration scenarios. We find that all models capture the general features of IDOC – that is, ICDs are stronger under the RCP8.5 (+2.6°C) scenario, while IDCs become stronger with increased greenhouse gases. Our analysis shows that the models are sensitive to the strength of atmospheric temperature feedback on IO variability. While some of our models show a strengthening of both the positive phase of IT",344,189,0.5919540229885057,7.808409848862705,0.8983677668536093,0.04536041027631624,0.9199999999999999,0.9130666666666667,0.817898491501468,78.63461538461539,78.59770114942529,85.21829330608074

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of climate changes on crop yield of soybean using the simulations of crop growth models. This is carried out on the basis of four different climate scenarios (A1B, B1, A2 and A1T) for a reference period 1984–2010 and a future climate scenario 2080–2100. The study highlights that climate variability and change have significant influence on productivity, especially with respect to yield gap and productivity growth, while the crop model used does not seem to capture the climate effect very well. It is also observed that soybean yields can change up to 50 % depending upon climate and the type of scenario used, and that the yield change is more pronounced in warmer and wetter scenarios.",346,181,0.51875,6.561726144849387,0.870677688817838,0.058672990671919285,0.88,0.8732352941176467,0.7726802331023943,57.68404763252751,58.725,61.026600363091006

Abstract
Water is considered as a 'common pool resource' as it can be easily depleted if left unmanaged. Climate change and its impact on water resource availability has been a cause of concern across the world. There are several reports on the impact of climate change at global, regional and local scales. However, in India the assessment and monitoring of impact at local scale is not very common, except in certain regions like the Himalayas where water is already in shortage, and in some coastal areas where sea level rise and cyclones have been impacting the water availability. Therefore, there is a need for a methodology and approach that can assess the effect of climatic change on different water sources like surface water, groundwater, etc. In this chapter an attempt is made to develop an approach, methodology, tools and indicators to assess and monitor the climate impact and associated changes on surface and groundwater resources.

Abstract
In order to understand how water availability in Mahānadi basin will be under various scenarios projected by the climate models for the 2071–2090 period and for various periods from 2065 through 2099, the present study was carried out with two sets of data. The study is based on 1D lumped mass balance model which was applied to the catchments in this region. A detailed analysis has been done to find the water balance of the study basin using 30 years of observed and projected data of meteorological elements. From the analysis of 1980 to 2015, it was found that, water storage of Mahnādī river basin is 0.25% of total water available in India. Water storage in 2050 was 3.9% and 7% in year 2105 which is very much inadequate.

Abstract
The Western Himalaya is a region that holds great promise for the development of a green economy. The region has a rich biodiversity and is home to about 60,000 species of flowering plants, of which over 3,500 are endemic to the region. It has the largest number of globally threatened species. This region is also home for many endangered and indigenous communities whose traditional knowledge about local climatic conditions and its impact on their livelihoods is very important to help them adapt to climatic changes. However, the climate of this region and especially the mountainous areas where 70% of the land is located, is rapidly changing. These climatic variations will have a direct impact and will threaten the biodiversity of both plants and animals, as well as the traditional cultures of these communities. In this paper, we will present a review of climate",353,182,0.5567567567567567,7.572710607566219,0.8878185977217553,0.049480769750628796,0.8914285714285715,0.8782608695652178,0.7967497337041161,66.0093038453105,61.24324324324324,59.73432612095933

Abstract
The paper examines the agroecological approach in mitigating climate variability and change in Teheru-Gahwal, which is in India's Himalayan foothills, using a participatory rural appraisal approach, to investigate the potential for climate resilience and adaptation in smallholder farming. The results from the participatory survey show that the small-scale farmers in this region have adopted agroforestry (AGF), conservation agriculture, mixed cropping, intercropping and inter-seasonal cropland management practices. These farming practices, when practised collectively, can contribute significantly towards adaptation to climate shocks. This is because these practices have the ability to improve crop yields in droughts and floods and protect against soil erosion in floods, and to maintain soil moisture and fertility in dry spells. Moreover, the farmers' participation in various agricultural development activities such as agro-foresty, conservation agricultural farming, integrated farming and farm mechanization have improved their adaptive capacity",357,200,0.5958549222797928,8.277881133609988,0.9016172257996103,0.04304541995628211,0.8971428571428571,0.8639053254437868,0.8165101706863167,59.24367088607595,73.11398963730569,68.1137445887446

Abstract
We present (13)C data of peat-forming plant biomass from the western ghats of southern peninsular India, and the results of a numerical model for carbon isotope composition. We interpret the data in the context of changes in precipitation and temperature, based on the 18O and 17O records. During the last glacial cycle (~ 20 kyears), the southward expansion of cold air from northern mid-latitudes led to the formation of an ice sheet over northern India. The resulting climate amelioration was followed by a shift in monsoon rainfall to more southern latitudes. This resulted in higher rainfall over the southern ghat region, but with a pronounced shift to earlier and drier monsoons, which were probably related to a change in sea surface temperature - in particular, the warming of tropical waters.",359,189,0.5649717514124294,7.516460280028289,0.8896902956665786,0.049070736731647274,0.8914285714285715,0.8857516339869272,0.8006632177200541,75.42014425254649,71.40677966101696,71.21652868969454

1. Introduction
The Indian monsoons are considered to be the most intense and variable of the world's atmospheric circulations (Wigley 1990). As a seasonal climate phenomenon, the monolithic character of rainfall over India is due in part to the large-scale circulation of atmospheric flow over the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal, which is modulated by the land–sea contrast between India and Southeast Asia [for reviews see e.g. “The South Asia monograph series on monosytem monoclimates 2”, (“Monsoon India”)] and is enhanced by a series of low-level cyclonic circulation patterns (""the Indian low"") that occur seasonally and on interannual time scales ",363,182,0.5853658536585366,7.496340570653091,0.8949936740627862,0.04741026146370229,0.86,0.8597142857142858,0.8013861602111271,54.666666666666664,59.40243902439025,56.450980392156865

Abstract
The Indian-Ocean region is one of the most vulnerable region in the world in terms of climatic hazards. The climate hazards in Madagascar are mainly caused by the tropical cyclones (TCs), El Niño and La Niña. In the past few decades, Madagascar has been affected by several TCs. However, there is a lack of scientific research on the TC impact and the vulnerability of this island. This study presents an assessment of TC impacts and vulnerability analysis of two main island ‘Antsiranana’ and ’Sandrovo’ in south Madagascar, and a comparison of impacts of El-Nino and la-nino years.

Abstract
HRD plays a significant role in enhancing the performance of an organisation. HR practitioners are increasingly being called upon to be responsible in the context of climate change and climate action. Therefore, it is important to examine the role of human resource development in building organisational commitments for climate actions. The purpose of the study is to understand the dimensions of Human Resource Development (HR) climate on organisational climate commitments in India. To test this, the research employed a survey design to collect responses from HR professionals working at different levels. Using a five-point Likert scale, survey responses were collected from the HR professional population. Data from 100 HR Managers and Directors was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences [IBM®] SPSS® 23.0. It is found that Human resources development climate has a positive influence on employees’ perceptions of their organisations’ climate commitment.

Abstract
The study was carried out at the experimental farm of the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan to estimate the impact of climate change on crop productivity at sub-tropical agro-climatic region of Pakistan. The study focused on the rice-wheat production system, where the yield of major crop rice depends on water supply. Rice-Wheat crop system is the main source of income of small-holdings farmers of this area and contributes substantially towards the economy of country.

The Indian summer monsoon is considered one of the most important natural climate variables in India, influencing the distribution and intensity of rainfall as well as the water balance of various parts of south Asia. This paper examines the relationship between seasonal temperature and precipitation, which forms the basis of seasonal forecasting of precipitation in Kerala. The data used was obtained through measurements taken at the Regional Research Laboratory (India Meteorological Department) at Cheruvattumala, Kerala from 1952-2009.
This study has shown significant variations in the annual, inter-annual and decadal means of summer rainfall. An increasing trend in precipitation was found to be significant in almost every season. In the summer season, there was a significant increase in rainfall from the 70s to the present, with a maximum rate of increase being 5 mm/yr. During the inter - seasonal monsoons, a decrease of maximum summer rains was also reported. From the decennial data, it can be said",372,199,0.5360824742268041,7.466764849624476,0.8816469158628953,0.051732229497315,0.8571428571428571,0.8571764705882348,0.7795246393584763,64.66666666666667,57.68556701030928,55.80834001603849

Abstract
The carbonate record of the last deglaciation is one of Earth's most valuable archives of past climate change. Here we use a 0.25 mm-scale record in the sediment from an oceanic basin to test the hypothesis that ocean carbonates preserve climatic signals. We present a record spanning the past 400 ka from cores collected at 5°W in 2002 during Leg 204 of R/V Mirai. This basin contains sediments that record the evolution of Indian summer monsoons (ISM), which influence the regional climate by transporting moisture from ocean to land. The record is sensitive to climatic and oceanographic variability over the 3 last 100 ky. At 180°E, where the ISM is strongest, we observe a strong negative δ18O record at the onset of glacial and interglacial warm episodes, whereas at ∼80°N, the opposite is",373,196,0.5879120879120879,7.931367688273783,0.8979290603269261,0.04516270601703134,0.9085714285714285,0.9045569620253154,0.8203623304233264,61.584899095337505,73.63186813186813,78.11247541087633

Abstract
Climate data are crucial to evaluate the impacts of climate changes. The objective of this study was to assess the trends in climatic variables and to identify the dominant climate variables that are most relevant to the agricultural production in the 11 agro-climatic zones of India using statistical methods. For this, monthly climate data of the years 1991 to 2010 were used. A total of 12 variables, including temperature (mean, minimum, maximum), rainfall [monsoon, post-monsoonal, long-term (<6-month), short-termed (>6–<12-months) and seasonal (-seasonal)]], sunshine & radiation, and wind were extracted from the daily meteorological data.

Abstract
We explore a framework for political economists to explain the design and implementation of policies on energy, the environment, climate change, renewable energy technologies and energy access, focusing on the three largest energy users in South-East Asia, India (1 billion people), Indonesia (~260 million), and Viet Nam (>90 million). Our framework has three levels. At the first, or macro level, we explore the role and influence of actors who seek to influence the policy agenda, their strategies, goals and resources. The micro level concerns the objectives of policy – what is being achieved or sought to be achieved. It includes issues of efficiency and equity, as well as environmental impacts. Finally, policy is situated in particular contexts. We focus on how the macro and micro levels interact to produce a political-economic framework, which we apply to the energy issues in India.

Abstract. A total of 200 farmers were randomly selected to assess climate perception, climate adaptation strategy, and climate coping mechanisms. The results showed that the majority of respondents (85%) had noticed the climate changes. Farmers perceived the current climate as ‘normal’. They were able to perceive the impact of climate-related events and their adaptation strategies. They adapted to the changing climate and adopted several climate protection measures.
The results of this study can contribute to better adaptation to changing climatic conditions in the region, including increased crop diversity and the cultivation of new crop varieties. It is also possible to develop new climate risk insurance schemes, improve irrigation, increase crop yields, protect livestock, develop drought- and heat-resistant crops, as well as the development of more drought and flood-resilient crops.",378,181,0.5170454545454546,6.8593830891441225,0.8724250013820157,0.056813306131187236,0.8514285714285714,0.8400000000000001,0.7497551461167917,49.63998734577665,46.88068181818182,47.9837848471223

Abstract
Climate variability and its effects on society have been a major issue in India. The country is prone to floods, cyclones, drought, landslides, earthquakes, and epidemics. In the recent past, the country has been hit by severe climate disasters like cyclone Aila (2009), cyclonic storm Fani 2019 and the earthquake in Jammu and Kashmir in 2005. This paper focuses on the perceptions, awareness, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, practices and perceptions of the community towards climate variability, climate hazards and climate predictions with respect to agriculture. It examines the role of indigenous cultural values in adaptation to climate and disasters in rural communities. For understanding the issues around climate prediction, 20 households from three villages were interviewed using semi structured questionnaires. Findings indicate that most people had a good knowledge regarding the causes of various climate events. However, a majority of them did not believe that climatic changes would affect their agriculture in future",381,194,0.5515463917525774,7.6821522972097975,0.8870453025433731,0.04937259028127049,0.8628571428571429,0.8592941176470588,0.7780613013022443,60.42099151618561,54.365979381443296,40.0640691026597

Abstract: This paper presents a study on the relationship between the climatic oscillation and the fishery catch rate in a sub-tropical region, which has a strong influence in tuna fisher. The study used the time-frequency technique and wavelets transform to analyse tuna landings time -series of the western Indian ocean, from 1972 to 2001. Using the wave-let analysis, two dominant modes were extracted from the data. From the first mode, the annual cycle is identified; and from second mode the monthly cycle and subannual cycle are identified, and are found to be the dominant oscillators. Then, an autocorrelation analysis was applied to the second harmonic of this oscillator. Finally, a Granger causality test is applied in order to check the causation between two series. It was shown that the fishing activity is affected by climatic conditions.

Abstract
Solar activities have significant effects on climate and weather systems of the earth. These effects can be either direct or indirect. The direct effects, mainly through variations in solar flux, are responsible for changing the atmospheric circulation and hence affecting the climate of various regions. On the other hand, indirect effects of solar variations can also modify the circulation in the atmosphere, through changes in stratospheric circulation, or the tropospheric heating, both of which can influence the weather and climate at the surface.
In this study, we attempt to examine the possible impacts of sunspot activity, sun activity (UV flux) and interplanetary magnetic field — which are three main factors responsible [directly or indirectly] for solar activities – on Indian monsoon, winter and summer weather. To this end, monthly averages of maximum, minimum, and average temperatures of Indian regions were examined for each season.

Abstract:
The present study assesses the social dimensions of climate vulnerability in an Indian coastal village of West Bengal. It is observed that the village, which has already experienced severe flooding and other climatic extremes, is highly sensitive to climatic changes, and therefore, has low resilience capacity. The vulnerability of this community is further amplified by its social characteristics such as a high dependence on natural resources, low income level, large household size, female-headed households, poor education levels, high illiteracy rate and low access to information. These factors are considered as drivers for climate-induced displacement and vulnerability. This study also explores the coping capacities of the community, through various livelihood strategies such a shifting cultivation, fishing, livestock rearing, migration and cultivation with the use of chemical fertilizers. Further analysis is conducted on the gender and age dimensions for the assessment of climatic change and its vulnerability at the household level",389,183,0.5572916666666666,7.722059850411245,0.8887937133189766,0.04870416801911237,0.8857142857142858,0.8742857142857138,0.8040546043389145,80.91065519523494,66.58333333333333,71.00468200100553

The recent report on climate change from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been the subject of much debate in recent weeks. While many countries, including India, have been making their own efforts towards addressing climate issues, it’s time that we start to understand our own climate and the impacts that changing weather systems and rising temperatures are having on agricultural production. The Indian government, through the Ministry of Science and Technology, has established an independent panel to look into the effects of climate-change on Indian agricultural practices. Here the authors present the salient findings of this study.

Abstract
The mean and extreme states of climate variables, and the variability of these variables in the context of a 100 year hindcast are presented for the period 1900–2007 using an ocean-atmosphere coupled climate model. The mean climatological state of SINDICZ and SITIC is presented and their interdecadal variability is investigated. It is found that there is a large interannual variability in SIN, particularly for summer SST, that is not well described by the model, which is in line with previous studies. SIC exhibits high variability on the decadal time scale. There is evidence to show that SINTIC shows a strong link to the inter-decennial variability and inter annual variability exhibited by SINA, SICA and SI. These findings provide further support for earlier findings that the SIA and ENA are",392,185,0.5535714285714286,7.175105773237274,0.8845884770800294,0.0518631382467708,0.84,0.8413888888888893,0.7869976949225523,50.756554307116104,55.875,52.00830419580419

Abstract. The Indian Monsoon System (IMS) and the associated atmospheric circulation is analysed in a 0.5° horizontal resolution regional atmosphere-ocean GCM [COSMOS], coupled to an ocean GOM / OGCM 3D model. IMS is simulated in its inter-annual – decadal - multi-decadal variability. A set of 14 experiments has been carried out, with a resolution of ∼50 km, in order to study the sensitivity of I.
In order for the simulations of monsoons to represent the actual variability of these systems, the IIS must be correctly simulated. This is done with the use of a new set-up for atmospheric I/O, where the vertical grid is not fixed and a grid-box approach is used for vertical",393,193,0.5868263473053892,7.583467678834541,0.8958524857038691,0.04685596010469105,0.8733333333333332,0.8791608391608395,0.8072236650230193,56.11559139784946,69.03592814371258,58.674090038314176

Abstract
Gender roles and perceptions of gender are important for sustainable adaptation to climate change among mountain indigenous communities. In the present study, the authors investigated how gender, wealth, and climate perceptions are linked in relation to livelihood adaptation among Adis of East India. A total of 100 respondents were interviewed in four villages of West Kameng district in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh using structured questionnaires. The authors used a qualitative approach with a thematic analysis of responses and content analysis to explore the relationship between livelihood and household strategies of adaptation. Gender roles were found to play a significant role in adaptation planning among households.

The results suggest that summer rainfall in Saudi Arabia varies strongly with Indian summer monsoon, as shown by the strong positive correlation between Indian Niño3.4 SST and summer precipitation in the western Arabian peninsula. During El NiÑo years, the monsoonal precipitation is enhanced with the largest values in El-Niño summer (July and August) over the Arabian Gulf and the southern Red Sea. In contrast, during La-NiÑa years the precipitation during summer is decreased with maximum values during the northern winter months. Summer rainfall variability over Saudi is found to be mainly determined by a strong relationship between the NINO 3-2 SSTA with summer temperature at surface layer in Arabian Sea and with precipitation over western peninsula during Nino-3 years.

Abstract. India is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change due to its highly populated regions and extensive agricultural land which is very much susceptible to the climate changes like extreme weather. In the last one century India has experienced more than 50% of climate variability and change in the country. This variability can be attributed to natural and anthropogenic sources. The present study will focus on the impact of anthropogenically driven changes in emission of carbon dioxide, methane, black carbon, and tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols on surface radiative forcings and their impact to global and regional climate, specifically the monsoon and its variability. We will investigate the emission estimates of CO2, CH4, BC and SO2 and compare with the observational data. These emission estimation results will be used as input parameter for the aerosol transport and chemistry",396,188,0.5837837837837838,7.940317918613124,0.8968988674357213,0.04547566083002572,0.8799999999999999,0.8596273291925465,0.7939859990270803,68.45643730549634,68.46486486486486,56.110704294882346

In India, extreme climatic changes, including increasing temperatures and precipitation variability and frequency, have been affecting agriculture, natural ecosystems, the economy, and the well-being of human populations since the 1900s.
Extreme climate has also been identified as contributing to the spread of disease, such as malaria, cholera and dengue fever; increased vector-borne disease; reduced water quality; crop damage due to pests and plant disease and water logging; forest dieback, forest fires and forest fragmentation. Extreme climate events such floods and severe droughts cause widespread economic and human losses. The frequency and severity of drought in the country has increased in recent years. A large proportion of the population is vulnerable to drought. Climate change has been reported to have exacerbated the frequency of extreme drought and flood events in India (IPCC, 2007b).

Abstract
In a context of climate change, there is a growing concern among forest fringing communities about the future of their livelihood. The present paper aims to understand and explore the perceptions, adaptation strategies and the coping mechanisms adopted by the forest-fringing communities of the Eastern Himalayan Region, India. For this study, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in the villages of North and South Sikkim, which are located in close proximity to the Tsomgo Lake and Nathula Pass, respectively. Using a mixed method approach, 500 households were surveyed by administering a self-administered structured questionnaire. A total of 300 household were also subjected to a focus group discussion. Analysis based on both quantitative and qualitative responses was undertaken and key themes were identified to explore adaptation and coping strategies. Findings of this research showed that, majority of respondents were not aware about climate related changes and were unaware about any adaptation measures undertaken by them or their forefathers.

The cement industry is one of key sectors in global economy that has major contribution to greenhouse gas ((GHG) emissions. It is estimated that 8.1% of all global anthropogenic “green house gas” [GHGs] emissions are from cement production. Thus, it is imperative to identify and implement climate strategies to mitigate GHGs. A literature survey has been conducted to assess the GHG emission levels of cement industries in India. The research findings have revealed a significant difference from the earlier reports in terms of GH G emissions and their mitigation strategy implementation.

The Indian ocean is at the crossroads of three major challenges: climate, biodiversity loss and food insecurity. The region is home to more than 500 million inhabitants, 1.5 billion people depend on fish as a main source of protein, the region’s marine biodiversity is the richest and most diverse in terms of species in relation to the area and it hosts a quarter of the world’ food basket. At the same time, it is a region with a low level of economic development, with more then 50% of its people living below the poverty line. In spite of this region being rich in fish and marine products, only 4% comes from fisheries and aquaculture production. This low production is due to lack of investment in fisheries (",401,183,0.5738636363636364,7.613161450588532,0.8925896533613011,0.047833329189478746,0.8857142857142856,0.8776315789473684,0.797313094019179,59.26683716965047,62.98295454545455,60.416215638797894

Abstract
Mean-State Bias is a common error source in atmospheric models. The impact on climate variability, which is often considered to be the most critical source of uncertainty for the projections of global mean climate, has attracted considerable attentions. However, the impact, so far, is not well quantified, especially for regional climate. To explore the impacts of mean bias on East Africa, we use the ERA40 Re-Analysis data to investigate the relationship between the mean state bias and the climate variables over East Afica for 1961-1990. We found that mean biases over central and southern Africa significantly affect rainfall variability over Eastern Africa",402,189,0.5549738219895288,7.669890816099669,0.8878896268442072,0.04914894046072813,0.8285714285714285,0.8330538922155687,0.779391953027629,53.27677369344376,48.596858638743456,44.65277049883272

Abstract
The Indian monsoon rainfall, which is strongly influenced by sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, is a dominant component of global weather and climate. The monsoonal precipitation is highly sensitive to global warming, due to its close association with tropical warming. In this study, a global climate model (GCM) experiment has been carried out with doubled concentrations of CO(2 ), which has a major impact on the atmospheric circulation. A high resolution 3-dimensional GCM of 0.25∘ horizontal grid size and 15 vertical levels, GFDL-AM3, with an ocean model has performed this climate experiment. This model simulates the 20th and the beginning of this century [1961−2010 &1999−2004] and was used for the period of January-September for each year.

Abstract
Ethical climate at the organizational level is a key determinant of organizational outcomes. This study explores the impact of two different types of ethics climate on the employee commitment and the effect of ethical practices on these climates. It also studies how these two dimensions of climates interact with job performance in the Indian bank sector. The results show that in an Indian context, an ethical culture with high levels of fairness and integrity is more beneficial than a culture that is less ethical, in terms of job and personal commitment. A strong ethical orientation also has an impact on organizational performance. Further, results indicate that the two types interact in different ways on commitment; fairness climate has a positive impact, whereas honesty climate is negatively impacted by ethical climates that are less honest. In sum, the findings indicate an interdependency between an organization’s ethical and ethical commitment climates on job satisfaction and performance outcomes, thereby supporting the argument that an employee’ willingness to remain with the organization is an outcome of both an individual",405,198,0.44019138755980863,6.3637730675678865,0.8464069007636524,0.06619974790201477,0.9,0.8655135135135128,0.7611599979300506,52.420751633986924,52.17224880382775,50.67085504728817

Abstract
The Indian subcontinent is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate and climate-related hazards, including floods, droughts, landslides and heat waves. These hazards threaten the lives of millions of people, damage agricultural and forest resources, and cause billions of dollars in economic losses. Climate change, the increase in global temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions, will further aggravate the impact of these hazards. This is why the Indian Government has taken climate vulnerability assessments seriously, in order to inform policy development and to identify areas in need of adaptation action. In this paper, we examine what the results of such assessments might mean for managing water and other natural resources in a country like India. We find that the impacts of floods and drought are likely to increase as global warming continues, while the effects of heatwaves are projected to diminish. The effects on agriculture are also likely be severe,",408,183,0.5614973262032086,7.6783604533348715,0.8896699898684007,0.04856412956526543,0.8628571428571429,0.8792638036809813,0.7830252354835701,63.33008320332813,65.02139037433155,67.39286879363215

Abstract
We show that the present geotectonics of western India, especially the northward migration of the continental margin, can be explained by an equatorial migration (EM) of Africa from the T-T boundary during the Late Cretaceous. The EM model explains the tensional strain in the western margin of Indian Ocean (> 30 N) by the collision between Indian and African plates, and also the convergence in India (< 60 N). We show by numerical modeling of plate boundary migration and the associated mantle plume migration that these two features are consistent with the EM mechanism. We propose that India moved 50 km to the northwest relative to Africa during this time, which is the same order of magnitude as the current separation rate between these continents. In this model, India's north–south movement and India/Africa separation during EM is consistent and can account for the observed convergence between",411,199,0.5445026178010471,7.525175895041185,0.8842629696962797,0.050738858959949125,0.8742857142857143,0.8826347305389208,0.8013334304268643,76.13703545105366,68.92670157068063,68.57167050535159

Abstract. This study assesses the impact of model resolutions in climate models on the projections of the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) rainfall. We use the 20th Century Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 4 ""experiment"" 6 [RCP 2.6, RCP4.5, and RCS 8.0) to simulate the ISM and the associated extreme rainfall events. In addition to using two- and four-member 3 km atmospheric models, we also use a higher resolution model to investigate the sensitivity of ISMs to higher and lower resolution models. To evaluate the performance of climate predictions, an ISMR (""Indian Summer Rainfall Monsoonal Rain"" index, defined as total seasonal rainfall in a monsoons) is calculated.

Abstract
The present climate conditions and the future climate projections indicate that, in general, the Indian summer monsoon is likely to be more intense with higher rainfall and more frequent and stronger rainfall events. This is expected to affect the river flows which in turn could affect hydropowering. To estimate the projected change in the power output, this study has used a global hydrological model and a hydrotechnical model. Projection of rainfall under various climate scenarios has been done using two climate models, HadRM3.1 and HadCM3, with the period of 1950–2035. The hydrologic model is used to simulate streamflow using the calibrated parameters for the selected sub-catchment, which is considered as a reference catchment for comparison. A hydrotectical hydraulic model has also been used for simulation and estimation of the energy available from the sub catchments. It has estimated an increase of about 2% to",415,190,0.5348837209302325,7.0149342352998145,0.8784445709300199,0.05437436022705512,0.8133333333333334,0.8362162162162167,0.7808749156283858,49.131332082551594,53.55813953488372,46.43766404199475

Abstract
A comprehensive study based on data of the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite altimetry of surface winds and wave heights in 2-km resolution in Indian ocean and the Bay of Bengal for 1984–1991 period is presented. The objective of this paper is to analyze the seasonal/interannual variability and climatology of winds over the region as well as its associated ocean waves by means of wavelet analysis. It is also investigated the relationship between the wind and waves at regional scale. For the period of 3 years, 8 years and 10 years respectively, the dominant modes of variability are identified by using wavelets. These dominant waves have been identified as the Rossby-gravity wave, Kelvin wave and Rossbyswings.

Women's vulnerability to environmental risks in the context of climate variability and change and their impacts is of paramount importance in developing countries including India. The present paper highlights women' vulnerability in India in a context where the impact of changing climate and variability are beginning to be perceived by the policy makers. A literature review shows that the impacts of environmental and climatic change can be expected to increase women’s vulnerabilities as compared to men in different contexts and regions, but there is little research on this area in Indian context. Women are more vulnerable to water, food, health, shelter and livelihood issues. There are several reasons for this. Some of these are that women are mostly engaged in agricultural production and are involved in household food production as well as in livestock rearing. In rural areas women play a major role in food preparation, storage, processing, marketing and distribution. Their role is much more than that of men. They are also the ones who take care of children and household tasks and",418,196,0.5046728971962616,7.382728011866363,0.8725591046282665,0.054685951837891815,0.86,0.8566315789473694,0.766795464531425,49.34627329192547,51.401869158878505,48.3409282700422

Abstract
The impacts of rising sea levels and extreme climate on coastal populations are expected to grow rapidly in the 21st century, especially in low-lying coastal deltas and small island states. The extent to which these impacts occur, however, will depend on the exposure of vulnerable coastal communities. A major challenge is the lack of information regarding the relative impacts, and thus relative vulnerability, on a spatial scale for many coastal nations. We develop a method to map the extent and relative magnitude of the potential impacts for coastal settlements in India, based on their exposure and sensitivity to the combined effects of sea level rise, storms, drought, extreme temperatures and flooding. These are the same variables used in our earlier work to estimate global-scale relative risks to coastal infrastructure and settlements. To map these variables, we use gridded global climate data from the NASA Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase III. For a sample of coastal Indian settlements we then estimate seaward and landward displacement probabilities under climate",421,200,0.4975369458128079,7.088810304070324,0.8686131377262313,0.056939149673508695,0.885,0.8920670391061455,0.7782976420613781,62.27919320594481,57.33990147783251,54.87722222222222

Abstract
In the recent times climate has become more and more unstable. It is the result of the changes in the natural processes. The main cause of all the climatic changes is global warming which is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases.The emission has to be reduced to avoid further damage to the planet. India as a developing country depends on its agriculture economy and is vulnerable to any climatic change. This paper examines the impact of climatic instability on the agriculture sector of India. In the past few years India has witnessed an increase in its economy which has made it vulnerable.

The Indian monsoon is an important climatic system for the Indian sub-continent. The present work studies the last 100 yr of stalactite growth rates ([S.sub.st.a]) in the Northeast Indian state of Manipur. This stalactic record is found to display two periods of rapid growth: 1856-1865 and 1926 and a slower rate of growth from 1866 to 1936. Based on these rates we have calculated a total ""growth"" of 4.5 m, with two phases of high growth and one of low growth. Our growth rate is in good agreement with that estimated by [[L]., 2011].

The Indonesian throughflow (ITF) plays a key role in the climate system by affecting the thermocline depth in both the equatorial Pacific ([1]) and Atlantic oceans and by providing a pathway for heat and salt to move from the western Pacific to the eastern tropical Atlantic [2, 3,5,6]. The ITF has strong interannual variability - both in terms of the magnitude of heat flux through it and in its strength and spatial pattern. The strength of ITFs varies on decadal timescales, and the interdecadal oscillation of strength, which has been termed the Indo-Pacific inter-decal variability, is thought to be due to variations in Indian and Pacific basin sea surface temperature forcing (). The magnitude and direction of ocean-atmosphere heat coupling associated with the variability of these basin-scale heat transports have important consequences for climate change and variability.

Abstract
Climate change is expected to have a significant effect on agriculture in coming decades. In this research, simulations of climate impact and adaptation of two major agricultural regions were carried out in two climate models, using the CORDEX (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) framework, and the results were compared with the observed data. The results indicate that in future climate of the major maize producing regions - the Indo-Gangetic plains of Northern India and southern parts of Maharashtra & Gujarat – will become more favorable, leading to an increase in maize productivity in the coming years under future scenarios. However, there are large differences in regional impacts of global climate changes.

Abstract
This study examines the linkages between migration and climate-induced agricultural distress in a rural village in India. Based on data from 2000-01 to 2014-15, the study reveals the role of migration as an adaptation mechanism in the face of climate risk, especially in light of the recent heat wave in 2020. The findings indicate that the climate shock in summer has increased the propensity of male migrants from the village to migrate to urban destinations. In contrast, female migrants do not change their destination. These results indicate the different coping mechanisms adopted by farmers depending on their gender, age, and education.

This paper studies the determinants of innovation, its export orientation and the productivity of manufacturing firms for the year 2007/08, based upon the data from the Indian Manufacturing Survey. The estimation approach adopted is the “difference-in-differences” (DiD) approach and uses the firm level ""Exporting vs. Non-exporting"" as an instrument for productivity, and 'R' as a lagged variable for innovation. Results indicate that firms which export have higher levels of productivity. This is not surprising, since export-oriented firms face the pressure of having to compete with international firms on quality, which is a necessary precondition for exporting. Moreover, export firms also tend to be large, as the export market is large. In addition, firms in the non- exporting group tend not to export because they cannot compete against foreign firms. They also do not innovate because innovation is an internal process of change that",427,191,0.4793814432989691,6.677010875144965,0.8604255005148416,0.06100812743480846,0.8228571428571428,0.8355294117647062,0.7715309873490666,45.920212765957444,46.675257731958766,43.374926649341944

Abstract
Cities play a critical role in global climate change impacts and adaptation. The Himalayan region is projected to be one of the most vulnerable regions, and cities are likely to bear the brunt of extreme climate events. This paper seeks to contribute to understanding of adaptation processes in Himalayan urban environments. Households living in two informal settlements in Shimla were studied to understand their adaptation strategies, decisionmaking processes, vulnerability and coping capacities. A mixed-methods approach was used to elicit information through a semi-structured questionnaire, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and a household survey. Results indicate that adaptation to climate hazards is not yet well understood, though some households have been able to identify and implement adaptation responses. Vulnerability and capacity analyses were conducted to assess the vulnerability to and the coping capacity of households and community groups. These analyses indicated that the capacity for households to cope with climate-change impacts is affected by gender, education level, income level and household size.

Abstract
In this article, we present results of an assessment of climate and agricultural variability in India and how small farmers respond to this variability. Our study uses a combination of survey data gathered from 2005 to 2010, and weather data (rainfall, temperatures, wind speed, etc). Using these data, climate change impacts have been estimated, which in turn are expected to be compounded by other stressors such as market volatility and increasing cost of inputs like fertilizer. The impacts of these compounded stressors, on smallholders are also estimated. We find that the compunction of stressors is greater for the farmers, particularly, women farmers. These farmers are found to face higher costs of production and lower yields compared to other farming systems.",429,200,0.5684210526315789,7.835143501188126,0.8923403366808514,0.04724497781336789,0.8228571428571428,0.8120481927710848,0.7836820492810362,46.244714587737846,47.96842105263158,45.44740500463392

Abstract
Indian summer Monsoon (ISM) is one of the most crucial phenomena in the climate system. There is considerable evidence of a change in rainfall pattern in ISM. The present study is an effort to examine the intrasonan season ‘variation of ISMs by using the Regional Climate Model of IMD [Integrated Research on Monsoons and the Indian Diasporas] developed by IIT-M under ISRO funded project named ” Regional Scale Study of Climate change Impacts and Predictions”.The model has been used to predict rainfall of three seasons namely – winter, summer and autumn for four different regions of India. It is shown that the model is successfully predicting the rainfall distribution during all four seasons of 1999 to 2009. In addition, the ISMR of these four regions is examined for intrasonic seasons 1979 -200",433,183,0.6012269938650306,7.675952409881982,0.9001162793464808,0.04515155968448321,0.8866666666666666,0.902446043165467,0.8111705494032186,63.814470686967994,71.99386503067484,74.63854949874687

Abstract
A major concern of the international community is the impact of climate change on biodiversity, especially in the tropics where many species have narrow endemism ranges. The Himalayas, the Western Ghats, and the Nilgiris are the only mountain ranges in South Asia and together form the Southern Western Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspots. Here, we assess the vulnerability and conservation significance of these montanes with the aim of identifying conservation priorities in this biodiversity hotspot. We synthesize the most recent climate, land-use, vegetation, species occurrence (both plant and animal) and climate-vegetation data to understand the impacts of current and projected climate scenarios in terms of changes in biodiversity. Using the ‘hotspots’ approach, our analysis identifies three hotspots, each containing a set of endemic biodiversity of high importance. Two hotspots have a high proportion of their area within the protected area network; however, their high biodiversity and endemics have not",436,198,0.5416666666666666,7.505553499465135,0.8833846861476288,0.0510731183369025,0.8228571428571428,0.8350000000000012,0.7815128244446522,52.413293676451566,50.09375,47.11574074074074

AbstractThis paper describes the development and validation of a measure of Safety Culture – Safety Climate (“Safety Climate”) in the Indian Shipping Industry. The measure was derived from a review of available literature and through expert discussions. This measure has been validated using exploratory factor analysis [EFA). The EFA revealed two dimensions in Safety culture, one of them named as ‘safety climate’ with 7 items and the other one named “safety behavior” with three items. In this paper the validity and reliability of safety Culture measure and safety behaviour measure are reported using both of these measures.

Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to the coastal and island communities of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In 2009, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated the sea levels would rise between 18 cm and 59 cm for a global average temperature increase of 4 °C, and between one-third and one half of this amount at a temperature of two °°C. This report is part of a broader research initiative on the impact of climate change on island countries.

The mangroves of coastal India and Sri Lanka are among the fastest disappearing ecosystems worldwide, yet their responses to climate change remain understudied.
Our research team has studied the impacts of climate changes on mangal vegetation and assessed mangliferous habitats' capacity to adapt. Our analyses of satellite imagery have revealed that mangals respond to rising sea-level and climate variability by expanding their range and changing their structure. In addition, we found that the most vulnerable habitats are those that have the least capacity for adaptation. The study provides new insights on the resilience of ecosystems in the face of global climate threats, and is an important step toward the development of more effective policies and practices to ensure sustainable management of these valuable man-made ecosystems. More details can be found in a paper published in ""Nature Climate Change"" (open access).

The Indian monsoons occur in June–September (JJAS) every year, when the surface temperature over the Indian Ocean rises rapidly. A major reason for such seasonal variability is the large-scale atmospheric circulation, which includes the summer circulation “Indian monograph” [1]. The monographic studies of the seasonal variations of monomodal circulation and of its interrelationship with monolithic -mode circulation are reviewed in [[2] and references therein]. These studies indicate that the inter-annual variations in the monoidal circulation can be explained through the variations occurring in intertropical convergence zone, the subtropical jet, tropical monolith –mode and the tropical wave. The intermodes of these circulation variations have been discussed by [@Saji2016].

In the present study an experimental investigation of the performance of a solar thermal air air conditioning collector is performed at the National Institute of Technology, Rourkela. This collector has been constructed by integrating a photovoltaical thermal collector with a conventional solar collector. The experiment is carried out with various solar radiation levels. It is found that the solar energy is sufficient for the operation of thermal energy storage tank of collector and thus there is no need for any external heat source. Also it is observed that thermal efficiency of air storage system reaches up to 70% in case of solar irradiation of 800 W per square meter.",447,184,0.5939849624060151,6.850168759240548,0.893483826594576,0.05015236062200764,0.8400000000000001,0.8425688073394486,0.7634526448330635,48.53877163755722,47.56390977443609,40.741176470588236

The ‘Indian summer’ is a well-known phrase that is used in Europe and North America to describe a hot, dry, late summer heatwave that occurs in India, Pakistan and parts of Bangladesh. The heat is generally attributed to the strong monsoonal winds, which push hot air from India into Pakistan. This wind then blows over parts the Himalayas, creating a temperature drop on the western slopes and warming of the air on its way down over Pakistan, leading to high temperatures in Pakistan in late May to mid July, and also over Northern India (see figure). In the last decade, the severity of these heat waves in the Indus Basin has dramatically increased — in terms of both intensity and duration: the heatwaves of 2015 and 2001 have been more intense than those of past decades, with temperatures reaching record highs and the length of their duration increasing by 10–12 days. As a region, India is particularly affected by",448,198,0.5606060606060606,7.888426505157586,0.8905621017200805,0.04765078460019561,0.8628571428571429,0.8786206896551723,0.7990292922099957,66.0,65.79292929292929,60.851085481682496

Abstract
This study aims to examine climate modes associated with interannual variability of large sea surface temperatures (SST) in a region of particular interest in terms of its climatic impacts, the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean. The Indian Sea plays an important role in modulating the large scale circulation, including its role on global climate and weather pattern. This study examines the linkages between inter-annual sea level pressure ((TLS) pressure) teleconnections and SST variability in order to understand the interrelationships between these large climate patterns. These large modes are identified using the principal component analysis, where the first mode of inter annual variation of 30 year smoothed TLS is identified as a proxy for a large SSTA event, and the second mode is a representation of a local scale weather system.
The study reveals strong connections between the sea-level",453,182,0.5243243243243243,7.131581834309935,0.8763216784048902,0.054551810101402566,0.9028571428571428,0.8877018633540369,0.8013751489266285,73.64355231143553,66.56216216216217,68.84478012026372

Indian climate,Indian summer monsoon rainfall processes in climate change scenarios,"Indian summer monsoon rainfall processes in climate change scenarios: a regional case study of India
Abstract
The Indian summer precipitation is very important for the economy of the country as well as the agriculture sector. India has been experiencing significant changes in the summer rainfall patterns during the past 100 years, especially the monsoons. The monographic review reveals that the changes and trends in precipitation have occurred in different regions of this large country. This paper is focused on the analysis of monosyllabic Indian monographs that examine regional climate changes. It is observed that there is a significant decrease in summer rain events over the entire country during summer.

In an attempt to assess the regional climate impacts of global warming, the Indian monsoons of the future are projected to intensify, with a significant increase in extreme events like heavy rainfall, flood and drought. The study aims to investigate the impact of a climate change scenario on future regional weather and climate conditions, particularly during winter season, over Indo-Ganga-Brahmaputra /Himalayan regions and adjacent areas, by using a regional atmospheric climate modeling system. Two climate scenarios – A1B and A2 - are used in this study.

Abstract
An ensemble of 50 years of climate simulations with the HadAM3 climate general circulation model has been undertaken to investigate the effects of elevated anthropogenic aerosols over Indian Ocean on climate. Two climate scenarios have been analyzed with respect to a base 1951–2000. The aerosol radiative forcing from the Indian region has shown an increase of more than three W m−2 over the period 1960–2010 relative to 1976–1985, indicating a significant climate impact of aerosol forcing over eastern Asia. An increase in cloud fraction over land areas of western India, northern India and Nepal has led to increased cloud-radiation feedback",459,190,0.6578947368421053,8.111071056538128,0.9166559926891626,0.038198891878104206,0.88,0.8956249999999997,0.8367060066033171,88.38236648250461,84.82894736842105,70.54688445251058

Abstract
Globally, soil carbon (C) stocks are the largest reservoir of C on land and they represent a crucial carbon pool for the terrestrial biosphere. The Himalayan region, a large part of which is covered with glaciers, is the world’s third largest repository of soil C. It is thus crucial to understand how C is stored and mobilized in these high-altitude ecosystems, especially in terms of potential feedback between C dynamics and climate change. Using a combination of remote sensing and field data, we investigated how climatic and edaphic factors affect C storage in 17 sites from different climatic zones, altitudes and lithology across the Indo-Himalaya range. We show that the soil moisture regime determines the magnitude and the depth of the organic horizon and that its depth is highly correlated with soil temperature and C/N content. Furthermore, the amount of available soil water is an important factor controlling the distribution of organic soil layers in topographically",460,195,0.575,8.131727983645296,0.8955545317691438,0.045390746069226086,0.88,0.8836363636363628,0.8079357164397799,74.02643929351915,70.95,71.70772231274378

Abstract
Globally water is the most vital natural resource for maintaining human health and the economic and social development of a society. However, climate change, population growth, and rapid industrialisation pose major threats to water security for the future, especially in the developing world, where the poorest and most vulnerable people are located. This study aims to understand the impacts of climate variability-induced water scarcity on diarrheal disease and its adaptation strategy in India. In this study, we used the Water Scarcity and Diarrhoeal Disease Model, which was designed to explore the linkages between water supply and sanitation, water quality, diarrhoeal diseases, health status, malnutrition, poverty, gender, child survival, environmental sanitation status and climate variables. The study period was from 1962–2012. We used a multi-method approach for data collection and analysis. First, primary data was collected from household members in 15 districts of India through face-to-face household interviews",462,200,0.5595854922279793,7.774010108085902,0.8896839941282056,0.04826656738687758,0.8628571428571429,0.8714792899408281,0.7914666888347848,70.2002307913261,63.3160621761658,57.43629458192392

Abstract
The regional coupled climate models COSYCLONE-CLM, CCL and CLOUDY are used to study the impact of climate scenarios by 2060–2089 on the climate of the Asian monsoons. The results are presented as two types of precipitation: (1) the precipitation of a wet season and “monsoon-like” season, and; and, 3) for all three models, as 5–95 percentile values for precipitation and temperature. For all models the monographic precipitation – which is defined as the sum of both the wet and monson-likes season in the models — increases significantly with a global mean surface warming of +1.1°C in 2018 and reaches a maximum of more than 40% above the reference value of average precipitation.

Abstract
Climate projections over South Asian region for the 2036–2055 time frame (midpoint of 1st 3 decades of the twenty-first century, 2076-2105) were obtained from eight high-resolution global climate models [GCMs] by downscaling at 4km and 2km resolution for two climate scenarios – A1B and B2 - using the Multi-Model Ensemble [(MME)] approach. The “downscalled” results from this analysis were compared with the baseline projections (‘base case’) for both the climate extremes and the mean temperature using two criteria: ‘relative change’ and a relative quantile 95th percentile. This study is the first to quantify the relative change in extreme and mean temperatures at the sub-continental scale, as well as at a regional scale. For most climate-sensitive variables, there was a statistically-robust increase in the frequency",464,197,0.5628415300546448,7.613979090832101,0.8896710447539449,0.04876523331127607,0.8457142857142858,0.8704402515723276,0.8257574570331936,64.98425402154426,71.00546448087432,65.03648051426276

The Indian Ocean (IO) plays an important role in the Asian monsoon system and the global oceanic thermohaline circulation system. In this paper, we investigate the IO warming trend during the period of 1960 2004 using data from a coupled climate model. We use two sets of the model experiments: one uses 20th-century observations of surface temperature and sea level pressure, and one includes 30-yr-long re-analyses of ocean temperature, salinity and density to estimate the interocean temperature difference. The model results demonstrate that there is a 0.3°C warming in 1990–2011 (>50% of warming occurred since 1979) and a further 3.6° 2.9°, 8° and 9.5°.

The Chennai Metropolitan Area [CMA], in which 4.6 million people live, is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The city is projected to be affected by sea-level rise by 2100, which will result in a 3.5 m to 8 m rise in sea levels; extreme temperatures, and changes to rainfall and flooding. However, the Chennai CMA lacks the capacity to implement climate adaptation projects, as it has no disaster response plan in place. To address this, a disaster-risk reduction plan – the CMAP 2014 - was formulated, to identify the most vulnerable people, communities, settlements and assets in the city. This was then used to develop a Climate Disasters Resilience Index (‘CDRI’ ) for the region.

Abstract
The magnetic susceptibility and coercivity were determined for sedimentary samples taken from the northern Bay Of Bengal (BoB) and Andamans. The BoB samples show that the magnetic field of magnetite is of a lower strength than is that observed in similar sedi-ment in South China Sea. This is due to the fact that sedimental magnetites have formed under the influence of different magnetic and environmental field conditions. However, the magnetitic mineralogy, as determined with x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, show similarities in both sedimen and magnetism. A significant feature in this study is the detection of magnetic mineral particles with diameters smaller than 2 µm and their magnetic properties. These particles are probably produced by chemical weathering of pyroxenoids and olivines in sediment from a source area. Sedimental magnetic measurements are compared with the",467,199,0.5918367346938775,8.285714285714286,0.9006227598320835,0.04335346360719141,0.8628571428571429,0.8827906976744178,0.8076872050163862,69.08415480802424,70.47448979591837,74.62575757575758

AbstractThis paper estimates the effects that extreme weather events and temperature changes have on life expectancy at birth in rural villages in northern India using microdata on mortality collected in the National Sample Survey from 1977 to 2006. The results suggest that the mortality impact of heat waves is larger than that of droughts. This result holds for both the rural and urban villages. However, mortality from floods has a larger impact than does drought on the urban sample. A larger share of the increase in total population in villages is in low-rainfall areas during extreme events than during drought. In general, the impact on rural villagers is much larger for high temperatures than for drought, and for floods than drought; and vice versa for urban villagers. For rural areas, heat wave mortality impacts are larger in states with high levels of population density. Flood mortality increases faster in areas with higher population densities.): 8 (",469,182,0.45454545454545453,6.215815605080611,0.8492752840528168,0.06634472910150116,0.8342857142857143,0.858650306748466,0.7690762965482817,48.276205263085416,52.25133689839572,46.251278737952944

Indian climate,"Climate change, ecological stress and livelihood choices in Indian Sundarban","Climate change, ecological stress and livelihood choices in Indian Sundarban forests
This project aims to develop a better understanding of the links between livelihood options and climate change impacts.
Background
The Sundarbans is a unique tropical forest ecosystem in Bangladesh - the largest mangrove forest in the world. It provides critical ecosystem services to local communities, and is under threat. The Sundars are also a source of livelihood for the local people who depend on them – for fishing as well as collection of forest products such as honey and medicinal plants. However, the Sundans are a dynamic landscape, changing due to climate variability and human-induced land use. Understanding what drives livelihoods choices and how these choices can contribute in adapting to changing climatic conditions in a context of increasing climate instability is key for ensuring resilience of people in Sundan. For this, we need to take stock of livelihoods options of those communities who have been adapting and living in these ecosystems since long, to understand how they have adapted in past as compared to those who",472,192,0.5282051282051282,7.375983202606159,0.8789549357542593,0.05285730776519648,0.9142857142857143,0.8921637426900582,0.8019518739792085,68.22335299194476,69.95897435897436,72.04424307036248

Abstract
The objective of the study is to predict the rainfall distribution for Indian states using regional Climate Model 4 [Reg CM4] over monsoonal regions with the input data of SST and sea level pressure from GFS. The regional model Reg CM-4 and GRIMM-2 are implemented on regional grid with a resolution of 0.5° latitude and longitude. SLP is used as the initial condition in the model. In the current study, the impact of sea surface temperature [(SST) from NOAA] and atmospheric circulation – “Sea Surface Temperature /Sea level atmospheric pressure” [[SLA] ] on rainfall are analysed. RegCM- 3 is the base case model, whereas Reg. CM -3 with ‘Sla’ and Reg cm-5 is with without SLA.

Abstract. The active break spells (ABSs) of the Indian monsoons have an impact on the global climate system through various physical processes. This study uses a multi-model ensemble technique – Ensemble Prediction System [1] - to extend the predictability of ABSs for the next five days. An extended range of model forecasts — 10 days ahead –, is also analyzed. We first compare the performance of different models, using different predictors in a statistical analysis, to find out which model performs well for this task. Based on this analysis and using the ensemble of models with the highest performance, we develop an extended-range model (~ 3 days) for ABS prediction.
The extended forecast is evaluated against a benchmarking method that uses the NRLMSISE-00 model, and the results indicate that an improved prediction is",474,190,0.5392670157068062,7.452818434511943,0.8824234023081572,0.051545321247847234,0.9085714285714285,0.908982035928143,0.8105278495367907,74.94826007326007,75.65968586387434,78.98814707305273

Abstract. We investigate how Indian monsoons respond to global warming and how they are simulated in regional and general circulation models (GCM). We compare 22 models with a common atmospheric resolution (~ 2 km) that project the 20th century climate evolution until the end of the current century. The simulations start at 1950 - with the same initial temperature distribution as observed and 1850 as a reference case – and run until 2100 in the RCP 8.5 emission scenario. For each model, we project a summer rainfall index [rainfall > 10 mm d−1 (= mm day−0.1)] over India and estimate the probability of exceeding this threshold.
We show that, in agreement with observational",477,193,0.650887573964497,8.461538461538462,0.9162910667453409,0.037573245121176255,0.88,0.8921379310344825,0.8554915991074984,87.40087440676709,99.54437869822485,102.38095238095238

Abstract
Biodiversity of the Indian Himalayas is the richest and the most diverse of any region in the world. The region is endowed with 12 major biogeographic regions. This study deals with the impacts of climatic changes on Himalayan biodiversity with a special focus on the impact of global warming, and provides an overview on climate and climate related parameters affecting flora and fauna. In the present paper various factors are considered which affect the Himalayan flora-fauna in a bid to predict the effect of changing climatic conditions on this unique ecosystem of biodiversity. It has been found that Himalayan Flora and Fauna are likely to be adversely affected with increase in temperature as the alpine plants are expected to suffer most due to increased temperature, while the lowland plants would be able to survive. With the increase of temperature in alpine regions, the vegetation type may shift from a subalpine forest to a",478,180,0.4946236559139785,6.7457672909822515,0.8652904282166519,0.05935615927045069,0.8228571428571428,0.8283950617283949,0.7653961147012125,54.00966572694321,50.86021505376344,47.93368196964087

As the 2009 Copenhagen conference nears, the world is looking for solutions to reduce CO2 emissions. A number of options are available but the main focus is currently on ‘clean coal’. However, it is not enough.
The climate situation in Asia is particularly worrying because most of these countries have very low per capita emissions but they are expected to see a dramatic increase by the middle of this century. According to climate scientists and NGOs, a rise in sea levels of around one metre and a temperature rise of 3 to 4 degrees Celsius is expected by 2100. This rise will cause flooding, droughts, and will put at risk the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people. The Asian countries are among the most vulnerable to this problem. In the case of Sri-Lanka, for example, this could mean a reduction of up to a quarter of a metre in coastal areas.

Abstract
Indian Ocean is one of the largest tropical ocean in the world covering an area of 73.2 m km². The Indian monsoon plays a key role in influencing regional climate variability and changes. In the present study, the evaporation- precipitation variability is investigated over the Indian region using the Ncep CFS v2 Reanalysis (.nc format) data. A total of six variables are used to study the temporal & spatial variability of E-P variability using various statistical methods. To evaluate the model, a statistical technique is applied by comparing ENSO index. Further, EO and AO Index are also used as model validation parameter. Results show that the inter-annual variations are more prominent than intrans- annual variability. It also observed that E and P show maximum positive variance during the monsoonal period and maximum negative during pre-monsoons.

Abstract
Rice cultivation in India covers 10 million hectares and provides food for 150 million people. The rice yield is strongly related to climate change. This study estimates the impact of climate variability and change on rice production in six agroecological zones of the Indian states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Assam. We use the 1980s-based National Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting climate data and the MODIS 3-monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from June 2000 to May 2010. For this time period, we use a set of remote-sensing- and weather-model-driven methods to estimate and compare the effect of temperature, precipitation and solar radiation. Our estimates show that rice is highly affected by the temperature increase. In addition, a decrease in precipitation is likely to have a major impact in Maharashtra; the",483,192,0.581151832460733,8.03167811874588,0.89666508528743,0.0453017988234222,0.8914285714285713,0.8857485029940114,0.820520467592767,70.98211589252017,75.10994764397905,77.09819569743235

Abstract. Climate models of global scale are able to simulate the large scale patterns and dynamics of oceanic circulation but have been found to overestimate the strength of Indian and Atlantic Oceans (AO) Walker circulations. It is proposed here that these errors are due to the inability of model to properly represent the strong winds that form the surface boundary layer in the subtropical gyres and are crucial for the ocean to be a strong heat engine. This is supported by a direct comparison between the wind speed and sea surface temperature at the 200 hPa level for a range of locations in both hemispheres. The results show that the models simulate strong eastward winds at ~ 1000 hpa and these winds are responsible for transporting water from equatorial and tropical latitudes to lat. 45∘N and higher.

A better understanding of the impact of climate change on the Indian subcontinent is crucial to mitigate and adapt to its adverse impacts through informed water resources management policies. The present work provides a review of available literature related to drought characterization for India for the period of 1980–2010. This is done under three scenarios: current climate [1961–2000], present climate, and future climate. We identify the key characteristics of drought in India and discuss the existing literature on drought assessment. Further, to understand the future drought trends under future scenarios, we have also identified the main causes of variability of current drought and projected changes in future. Finally, the study concludes with an assessment of existing drought indicators and a recommendation for further studies.

Abstract
Climate variability, including drought events, is expected to intensify in the future in South Asia, which is home to a fifth of the world population. Here, we analyze the impact of climate variability and climate change scenarios on current and future soil moisture under present and more extreme climate conditions, using an integrated modeling approach at a pan-tropical scale. The Soil Moisture Accounting for Climate (SMACC) approach provides a unique opportunity to assess climate impacts on soil-moisture regimes under current as well as future climate. Our approach combines a process-based soil model of 1-km resolution with a regional crop model — the Global Crop and Terrestrial Ecosystems Model – to analyze climate effects on crop water use under different climate scenarios. We analyze soil water changes in a set of regions under four scenarios: a) current climate, b) RCP 2.6 (~2°",490,185,0.55,7.379024325749306,0.8848754153131206,0.051046862153629594,0.8685714285714285,0.8830769230769223,0.8115216395571074,69.35681103975952,70.87777777777778,71.87354883559263

Abstract
A study of climatic factors affecting the incidence of malaria in a region has been attempted using the monthly mean maximum, minimum and mean temperatures and monthly accumulated precipitation during the monsoon, dry, winter and spring periods at DehraDun (Dehradoon), India. The study has attempted to establish a correlation between malaria and the climate and to study the influence of temperature and rainfall on malaria transmission at different seasons. Correlation between the climatic variables has also been established. A significant correlation has emerged between temperature, rainfall and incidence rate of the disease and a strong inverse relationship has developed between rainfall, and minimum temperature during summer months and disease incidence and between precipitation and temperature in winter, spring and fall months. It has further been observed that the mean temperature at a higher altitude shows a stronger relationship and that rainfall at lower altitudes shows more impact on the transmission than the rainfall in high altitudinal area",491,183,0.42391304347826086,5.750236290040988,0.8354290501724444,0.07266410046564818,0.8057142857142857,0.8165000000000002,0.7309488566821659,37.661378413524055,41.09782608695652,39.11731972038264

Abstract
In order to understand climate change impacts on tribal lands, a better understanding of tribal land and resource management is essential. In 2010, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) established an official process for the consideration of the impacts of climate on developing nations, including the U.S. The National Tribal Conservation Grants Program ($2.2 million) was established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. As part of this program, this research will examine the relationship between tribal climate adaptation and tribal regulations that protect natural and cultural resources on their reservations.

Abstract
Assessment and analysis of the hydrological impacts in the catchment of river Tungabhadhra are carried out by means of a model HEC-HMS (Hydrological Engineering Center – hydrometric modeling system) to predict the changes in flow regime and the corresponding impact on agriculture, drinking water supply, and irrigation system and flood control. For the prediction of flood risk, a simple and easy to use software package, called the SIRCOM 2007 software, is employed, which is based on the conceptual model approach. The impact of different climate scenarios has been analyzed on different aspects of water resources management. A scenario for the future 2050 was developed in a two step approach: 1) the ‘business as usual’ scenario was constructed to assess climate related",493,180,0.6046511627906976,7.929925657295443,0.9022624346780211,0.04372011702968091,0.8466666666666666,0.8459459459459462,0.8155918340606948,59.47439306282983,68.0813953488372,55.59568981396205

Abstract
Sal is one of the most important plantation crops that is cultivated by the people belonging to tribal communities of India, particularly in Assam. The sal trees are grown on a wide range of soils. This study was undertaken to examine the changes in sal’s climatic range and its response to climate change. We used the sal tree as a bio-indicator for climate and environmental change in eastern India. A total of 20 sal sites across eastern and northeastern India were studied for this purpose. In all 10 sal stands were selected based on the presence of different sal communities. Sal sites selected for the study had mean altitude ranging from 80–250 m, mean temperature ranging between 23 and 24 C, and mean rainfall ranging 1000–2000 mm. Mean annual precipitation of these 15 sites was found to increase with the altitude, while mean annual",494,188,0.53125,7.361215932167729,0.8796912761713852,0.0526906928950963,0.8285714285714285,0.8602380952380951,0.7932054161325705,53.84514761682296,55.807291666666664,49.6993006993007

Abstract
This dissertation explores the role of the Integrated Assessment of Climate Change (IACC) methodology in addressing climate change in developing countries. The IACC is a tool which combines economic, ecological and social science analysis to provide an understanding of climate and the impacts of various mitigation and adaptation policies to climate. As a relatively new method, the IAAc is increasingly being used and promoted in countries such as India to address climate policy. However, little has been done to understand this approach and its relevance in the South to help bridge the North-South divide in climate governance. I have conducted a comprehensive literature review to better understand the strengths and limitations of this method and to assess the current status of using the method in different countries across a range of disciplines. Based on my analysis, I argue that the methodology has several strengths which can help address the",495,197,0.5376884422110553,7.585028893589194,0.8827809826170588,0.0509902170720762,0.84,0.8601142857142853,0.7952007065375879,66.19249823071479,61.47738693467337,52.50026835551739

ResumenThis paper investigates the influence of climate on sea level in a coastal region of the Western Indian subcontinent, using marine sediment and coral proxies from three coastal lagoons of Goa, India. The study is based on 13 marine sediments collected during three seasons, between 2006 and 2011. A new method for reconstructing sea levels in lakelagoon basins is developed, which is calibrated on the data. It allows the detection of both long-term changes and short- term, local variability of sea - level, in response to changes in climate forcing, such as the North Atlantic oscillation, ENSO and monsoons. Sea – level was higher during LIA and LIG.",496,197,0.5843373493975904,7.528660099351429,0.894898651542771,0.047340644819691656,0.8533333333333334,0.8583098591549303,0.7992493412495227,55.333333333333336,48.566265060240966,52.29922385620915

Abstract
The ISO9001: 2000 is the most important and significant tool for quality management system, which is used by many organizations around the world. ISO standards help to improve organizational performance. There is no doubt about the fact that ISO can bring about a radical change in the way an organization functions. The ISO is also known as a strategic tool that can be used as an organizational change agent in order to create a change and transformation in an organisation. However in recent times there has been a decline in use of this tool. In this paper, we have tried to understand the reasons for the decline, in spite of all the success stories and the various benefits which it can provide. We have also tried in this study to identify the factors which are responsible for this decline.

Abstract. Chromolaenia odorate is a non-native tree introduced to the region as a commercial timber source. It is now a major threat to forests and agricultural fields of South and Southeast Asia and has the potential to cause major economic losses in these regions. To determine the current and future range of the invasive tree under the scenario of projected temperature and precipitation changes, a GIS-based approach has been used to predict the future geographical range. The current distribution data were collected from literature and GIS. In this study, we have considered three possible future climate scenarios. Our aim was to assess the suitability of different climatic scenarios by considering the species’ distribution. We have assessed the climatic suitability using the “Maximum Mean Difference” (“MMD”) method. A total of 12 climatic variables were used",499,184,0.53,7.495331880577403,0.8801736044646179,0.052075112345854165,0.86,0.8722727272727281,0.804468541583305,60.949113779302465,62.295,54.7394058168598

The Atlantic Multidecade Oscillation – AMO has long been hypothesized to be a driver or a modulator of the tropical atmospheric circulations. Here, we assess the role of this mode of climate variability in the summer Indian monsoonal rainfall. To assess this, our climate simulations include the AMOs and a control simulation with a prescribed AMOSc amplitude and no other climate forcing. The climate simulation is performed with the climate component Bergen model. We compare the simulated tropical climate to a multi-model ensemble of simulations performed by the CMIP6 models, which includes both the observed AMOC and AMOV, and to the historical climate. Our study shows that the simulations with",500,184,0.5393939393939394,6.928640603037555,0.8790999419551458,0.05452127775730662,0.8533333333333334,0.8289361702127663,0.7619450918997123,49.71416569257744,53.27878787878788,44.52412425644415
