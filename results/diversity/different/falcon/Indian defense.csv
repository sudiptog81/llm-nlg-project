India’s defence budget is expected to be hiked by about 6%, to around US$ 40 billion, in the forthcoming budget session, the second major hike in as many years. This will be the seventh increase in six years, and is being done in sync with the ‘Make in India’ initiative and “strategic autonomy” in defence manufacturing.
This article is an exclusive for South Asian Defence Review
While the hike is welcome, it is also being pointed at as the reason why the country is unable to procure major defence equipment despite its huge budget size. The reason for this anomaly has been attributed to the fact that the Indian defence industry, as a whole, is still at a very nascent stage. It has not yet been given enough impetus by the government and, therefore, lacks the expertise and ability to deliver. As a result, all procurements have largely taken place with a number of foreign partners, mostly from the US, France",1,200,0.5665024630541872,8.071417672951359,0.8930450178441938,0.046351101106345154,0.855,0.8460335195530717,0.7822031890256724,56.188263036329914,58.64039408866995,50.95209895052474

The authors present a dynamic model of fiscal relations between the Centre and the States in India. Their main finding is that the optimal tax burden is not determined by inter-state disparities, but by the elasticity of demand for public goods.

India-Israel relations are at a critical juncture. The two countries have enjoyed a close defence partnership since the 1980s and are set to enter their next golden phase.
The two nations have long been strategic partners, but their relationship in recent times has been characterised by close cooperation on counter-terrorism, countering proliferation of WMDs, and joint development of new weapons systems and equipment. In 2017, the two sides signed an agreement to jointly develop a third-generation fighter jet. Israel has also been supplying India with advanced defence technology to enhance its military capabilities. India, in turn, has played an important part in Israel’s defence industrialisation efforts as it develops new platforms and weapons.

The Indian army was to be the backbone of Indian foreign policy and Nehsr’ vision included a well equipped and modern army with an integrated air force, navy and missile programme. Nehrs dream of an army that stood for modern India and an Indian nation state was not achieved due to the lack of support and financial resources from the British rulers and the political instability within independent India.

Abstract
Attrition is one of the most serious problems confronting the Indian defense forces. It has been an issue of concern for the government and for many decades there have been many initiatives launched to curb the trend of increasing attrite rate, which has not yielded results. The Indian Air Force, is an integral part of defence forces of India, the armed force is known for its strict recruitment process. But the high rate of attritions in this force has created a problem in the organization.
The purpose of this study was twofold. First, to identify the factors causing attritic in IAF and to find the solution to the problem. Second, this article will discuss the effect of emotional quotient on attritis in Indian armed forces in general. A survey of 500 I.A.F personnel was carried out by researcher and questionnaire was used. In this survey, it was revealed that attritional rate was 20-25 per cent and",20,198,0.5532994923857868,7.765928448682152,0.8879740632962071,0.04882439995257668,0.8342857142857143,0.8501734104046241,0.7827697642977383,58.59534957652063,62.23857868020305,52.74170673076923

India is now one of Singapore’s top four trading partners, and Singapore is India’ most important foreign investor. In addition, the two countries have worked to increase cooperation in areas such as defence technology transfer and defence procurement.
This article will outline Singapore-India defence cooperation, focusing on Singapore as a defence partner for New Delhi. The first section will discuss the historical context that led to the growth of the relationship. This will include discussions of India-US tensions, Indo-Sino-American relations, as well as the changing nature of security and politics in Asia. It will also explore some of New Delhis concerns about Singapore, such the Singaporean-Chinese relationship, Singapore's support for Pakistan, Indian perceptions of regional power shifts, concerns over the use of technology and the possibility",21,180,0.5628415300546448,7.613979090832101,0.8896710447539449,0.04876523331127607,0.8685714285714285,0.8789937106918244,0.7940198950297548,64.3111829885352,63.622950819672134,62.65384615384615

The Kargill War (also known as the KARGIL conflict and KARGHIL War) was a small armed conflict between India and Pakistan in 1999 over control of the Siachen Glacier, one of Earth's highest battlegrounds.

The K-word is often seen as a ""red flag"" in India-Pakistan relations and as such, it is rarely used, although in some quarters it might be used as an acronym for KASHMIR.

Abstract – In the last 15 to 20 years, defence procurement in India has been characterised mainly by a large volume of imports. India's defence industry has also been unable to meet the requirements of the defence services. There is a growing perception that the procurement practices in the Indian defence forces may be contributing to an increase in defence imports, especially from the Western defence equipment suppliers. However, the issue of defence production in this country remains highly contested. The objective of this paper is to propose a methodology that will allow defence suppliers to make a better estimation on the total cost of ownership of a system. This framework will be based on life-time cost assessment",23,186,0.49214659685863876,6.801601289748763,0.8650149015489655,0.059177169606206205,0.7828571428571428,0.7988023952095812,0.7480162604782903,35.18421052631579,38.6282722513089,36.72903441363181

US President Barack Obama is visiting India. During this visit, both India and the United States are likely to announce a joint statement on defence and security cooperation between the two countries. The joint declaration will be issued in response to the recent joint strategic dialogue between India the US on August 27, 2015. It will cover a wide range of defence issues including the transfer of high technology to India, India’s membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), India-Israel defence relationship, joint military exercises, etc.
This joint defence declaration may also be an attempt by both the countries to counter China’ s military presence in Asia and its growing assertiveness in South China Sea and Indian Ocean. As a result of China ‘s growing military power and strategic assertation and in particular in its maritime domain, the Obama visit is expected to be the most significant visit of Obama to Asia.

Introduction
The Indian Defence sector has been opened up for investment from overseas with the passage of the Defence Acquisition Policy (DAP), 2012, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board [FIPB] Guidelines and the Strategic Defence Procurement Policy of 2006, as the three most important legal documents in the sector. The DAP,2013 further provides guidelines for the FDI in various defence sectors.
It is a known fact that India has made rapid strides in terms of its military power, especially during the Kargil war against Pakistan. However, there has always been the question of defence preparedness of our country. This has resulted in India making a number of strategic decisions with regard to defence. One such decision was the signing of a nuclear co-operation pact with US in 123 Agreement, in April ‘05",25,191,0.6032608695652174,8.183028566596791,0.903084989003129,0.042791526105216006,0.8799999999999999,0.8764999999999998,0.8217193575237061,65.72533430649324,71.94565217391305,72.06762820512822

It will help to reduce the time taken for contract execution and thereby help in meeting the operational needs of the defence forces. In the case of procurement of equipment for export, the foreign exchange is used as a source of funds to be transferred to foreign suppliers and this money is not available for other purposes. This is done because the country needs to have a good balance of trade.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) and the Pakistan Air force, the world’s largest and second largest nuclear armed nations, are both in need of a defence budget.
With India planning to increase its defence spending to 1.2 per cent of its GDP by 2022, Pakistan has also increased its annual defence expenditure to Rs 250 billion ($3.1 billion).
In India, this is the first time the government has earmarked Rs. 2.7 lakh crore or Rs2 lakh crores for the country’ defence needs. In a big boost to the national security, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved the proposal to hike India’ defense spending by Rs3 lakh to over Rs1 lakhcrore to strengthen the armed forces.

About India's Defence Production
The Indian defence production has evolved over a period of 5 decades into its own unique space with a strong base of private sector players that have grown along with the industry. India has been able to establish a defence ecosystem that has contributed immensely to the country' s security.
India' defense manufacturing is a key pillar of the 'Make in India'' initiative. The government has undertaken a number of steps to boost India’s indigenous defence manufacturing capabilities through the creation of necessary industrial and infrastructure facilities. With a view to develop and enhance the defense ecosystem, the government launched the Defence Industrial Park, a project aimed at creating an environment that supports the development of defence industrial clusters. It also aims at facilitating investment in defence sector, providing support for setting up of infrastructure and technology for production and exports. To this end, in 2030, India will have 1000 defence Industrial Parks in the various",34,189,0.5583756345177665,7.837175498670061,0.8897026514847708,0.04807102726447423,0.8742857142857143,0.8825433526011552,0.8075934763025719,66.80001139211666,66.98477157360406,59.833701901813356

US President Obama’s first meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was a success with the two leaders agreeing on a $5-billion defence deal, a joint statement on climate change, the Iran nuclear programme and the war on terror. The two countries announced the launch of the “US India Strategic Dialogue” to review the full range of bilateral issues as well as the regional architecture and security situation in the region and globally. They agreed to expand high-level military-to-military cooperation including the exchange of senior delegations, exchanges of military officers, joint exercises and visits by senior officials. This is the first step towards a more comprehensive defence engagement. In the next 10 years, India and US are expected to spend more than 50 times their current defence budget to reach the level of China.

It is a good idea to have an understanding of the current state of India’s armed forces, including the size of its active and reserve forces and the number of military bases in its territory, before looking at the trends in defence spending. India is the world’ s second largest defence importer. As of 2020, India spent US $69 billion on the Defence sector as per the SIPRI, (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) report. However, in the last 10 years, the country is also trying to reduce the gap in spending and has increased defence budget to 2% of GSDP. The Indian defence sector is growing steadily with the increasing demand and production of defence equipments. In this post, we will look at a 7-year period 2008-15.

Indian defense,the envisioning of a nation: a defence of the idea of india,"the envisioning of a nation: a defence of the idea of india
The idea that is commonly understood to be India today was not the first of its kind. There have been a number of visions that the people of India, over the centuries, have had for the nation. It has been shaped by the experiences of different peoples and the ideas that they have brought to the country.
It has never been one single vision, as is the case with most countries, but several. And it is precisely because of this multiple nature that it has taken centuries for these visions to converge into an idea as we know it today. The first such vision was of Emperor Ashoka, who was one of Asia’s most enlightened leaders in history. He is also known as ‘Ashoka the Great.’
Ashokas’ vision of his country was a very inclusive one, which was in sharp contrast with what the world was at that time. His vision encompassed all the peoples that came",46,184,0.4712041884816754,6.512171447631794,0.8567356082990116,0.06280679351650598,0.8285714285714285,0.8471856287425134,0.727197139947191,37.93098591549296,44.73298429319372,44.09404821697639

the indian government, under a new minister of defence, has been in a state of shock since the election results of may 2014 were announced. this is partly because the congress lost the elections badly (in india, not in the us) and partly for the other reasons the loss has thrown up.
while there’s a sense of relief in that the aam admi [ordinary man] who voted congress to power has not turned out to be a vote to the left or a vota for baba ramdev or the bjp, the fear of what the right-wing, pro-business, ‘pro-globalisation’, 'pro-'whatever the americans want' government can do to us is palpable. and it is a legitimate fear. for it seems that all the major issues of the last 60 years are coming under attack. not just from the opposition but also from",47,191,0.5683060109289617,7.687901217927558,0.8915257211324332,0.047945469124148675,0.8342857142857143,0.816352201257862,0.8009718276881453,54.66981132075472,53.72677595628415,46.97475622968581

In the recent years, the world has witnessed a growing phenomenon of ‘criminalisation of politics’ as a means of political oppression. The most prominent of such cases is the ongoing trial of former President of Maldives Mohamed Nasheed for the “crime” of defying the order of a military coup by his predecessor Abdulla Yameen.
Nashed’s 11 year long incarceration was a result of him (and several other opposition figures) being charged under the draconian Anti-Terrorism Act 1978, a law which has been used to silence dissent and stifle free speech throughout its tenure and in various countries around the globe. Nashed was not the only one who was persecuted by this colonial law. In fact, this anti-terror law was used by Yamaen to persecute over 100 members of the political opposition. This included Nasheeds’ close political ally and the leader of Dhivehi",50,193,0.6185567010309279,8.615497903412857,0.9088118165340473,0.039858429283001616,0.8457142857142858,0.8654117647058812,0.8177056142566823,66.28333333333333,64.0618556701031,73.48629424011104

India’s Defence Strategy
The security concerns that India faces today are more complex and challenging than ever before, and the country’ s security strategy is also being reshaped in accordance with this. This article looks at the main features of the security challenge India currently faces and what it will take for the new government to be able to successfully address these challenges.
Introduction
Since the end of colonial rule, India has been a country in transition (Majumdar 2007). This transition is a product of a number of historical factors which include a combination of factors such as its geography, demography and economic development which have shaped its security environment - a factor that has played a significant role in determining the nature of its foreign policy and national security priorities. In addition, the transition process has had a bearing on the way security issues have been addressed, with the military playing the major role. However, over the years, this has changed",56,191,0.5591397849462365,7.625649981110372,0.8887516347671056,0.04901860794243279,0.8571428571428571,0.8538271604938275,0.7938435952393944,54.25067511231131,59.483870967741936,56.741622418879054

Defence expenditure of India is one of the highest in percentage of GDP. The question whether it is really necessary for the defence of a country like India or the funds could be used for other development purposes like health, education etc. has been debated for a long time. It also needs to be looked at in the light of its effect on economic development of this country. Defence expenditure has grown at a fast pace, from 2.5% of GNP in 1960 to 7.9% in FY 2006-07. In the last decade, the ratio of defence expenditure to the GDP has increased from an average of 5.8 per cent in pre-reform period (1971-75) to an all time high of around 6.6 percent in recent years.

India’s defence expenditures had been a cause of concern for quite a long time. The government of India in the 1980′s had to face serious economic problems. There was inflation and the balance of payment position was very bad. In spite of that the defense spending increased at a rate of 9%. In the period of early 90″s India had faced a major economic crisis which resulted in a very low growth in economy, high rate inflation, a large fiscal deficit and a high current account deficit. India faced the problems of a balance payment crisis. This had a big impact on India’ s defence. At the time of the economic crises in India, it was decided to cut defense budget by 20%.
The Indian defense industry also suffered from the problem of low technology level. A large part of military hardware was imported and India also had very few defense industries.

In India, the Cyber Security Research and Development Center will be set up under the aegis of the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) in the capital city of New Delhi. Cyber security is a growing concern for all nations, including India. The Indian government has taken several actions in recent years to strengthen the country'
s defences and improve the security of its information systems. India has also joined the United States and several other countries in supporting the adoption of voluntary standards and best practices for information technology security and privacy.
As part of these efforts, it has become clear that more needs to be done to help companies of various sizes and types better secure their information and information networks. To help fill this gap, India will soon be setting up a Cyber Defence Centre, with a focus on the development, promotion and implementation of best security practices.

Abstract
This work aims to study and explore the role of social network in countering terrorism in Modern Indian Defence Sector. The work is based on the theoretical framework of Network Analysis, and specifically on Social Network, a sub discipline of network Analysis. In recent years, Social networks are being applied successfully in various fields of research such as, sociology, psychology, political science, business, etc. However, the application of Social network theory has not been used extensively in the area of security, defence and counter terrorism. This work focuses on social networks as a tool for identifying the network of terrorists and their supporters, for predicting the next attack, detecting the terrorists in a network and also for tracking the movement of the terrorist across different cities.
In this paper, two case studies of Indian defense are studied. Both cases are from Maharashtra and are related to the Indian Army and Indian Intelligence agency.

Indian Industry has come of age in the past few decades. It is an industry which is not only self-reliance, but which has also emerged as a significant player in both the domestic as well as the international arena.
In order to achieve the goal of self reliant industrial development and to promote industrial growth and development the Indian Government introduced several industrial and fiscal reforms from 1991. The main objectives of these reforms were
a) To create an atmosphere conducive to private enterprise and private entrepreneurship. b) to attract foreign investment and technology and c) the creation of a competitive domestic environment. These objectives were achieved through de-licensing, liberalisation, privatisation and the reduction of fiscal deficits. All these were implemented in a phased manner and in 2009/11 India was rated the 9th most preferred destination by foreign investors.

In the backdrop, India's growing economy is the fastest growing among the G-20 countries and is set to become the third largest in the world by 2020. India is on the threshold of an economic transition where economic growth will accelerate to the next level. The country also stands poised to take a leadership role in global growth for the first time in its history.
While it is true that India has become a much stronger defence and strategic partner to several nations, its defence budget is still very small when compared to that of the US, Russia and China. It is therefore important that this is seen as a long-term goal, and not a short-cut. A larger defence outgo will not only have a negative impact on economic prospects but also on social and political goals of national development. This will also impact the country' s ability to meet its foreign aid commitments.

Abstract: The coasts of Western India face the problems of erosion of the beaches, which may cause loss of property and life. The beaches also provide important means of livelihood for the local populations. Coastal protection is a problem of considerable dimensions in India. However, it is still not very well understood. A study was made of three coastal areas, namely, the coast from Varkhal, near Vengurla, to Vadal, between Vennar and Terekhol Rivers. From Trivandrum, along the west coast and up to Kollam. This study is concerned with coastal geomorphology and the coastal engineering",102,197,0.547486033519553,7.324863908968972,0.8838686094078663,0.051548587056130184,0.8342857142857143,0.8056774193548382,0.7561166170637655,40.522844784727056,43.86033519553072,40.5925232244531

In his seminal work, 'Deterrence and Defence', Dr V.P. Srivastava (2003) has argued that ""the Indian concept of security is not one of an absolute defence against an external attack"". This is so because ""... India, in its quest for security, has always been a realist, and it has sought to ensure a balance of power in the sub-continent"". The author has also argued further that, since 1947, India “… has been engaged in an effort to achieve a modus vivendi with the neighbouring countries … and to seek a durable peace through dialogue”. He has gone on to say that this “peaceful policy has worked well to India’s advantage in securing her interests"".",103,199,0.5802469135802469,7.385337492392829,0.8930140056134155,0.048420578127970154,0.8866666666666667,0.8773913043478264,0.8060365636868698,67.63513873558406,73.77777777777777,63.89694976076555

[9][page needed], The right to self-defence was upheld by the Privy Council in the 1885 case of State of Bombay v. Dhirendramohan Barua.[10][11]. This was also one of the first cases to recognize the use of private force, in addition to the state's authority, to protect a person' s life and property.... and 'right of self defence' which has been given the widest scope in India. The Constitution of India has not provided any specific right for private defense, but the right of ""self-defense"".

As part of our efforts to strengthen our defence and security relationships with key partners, we welcomed the United States, India, Japan and China into the Singapore International Agreements Programme (SIAP), which provides a platform for Singaporeans to understand and debate international agreements that affect our country, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership [TPP] negotiations in Aukland and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in Kuala Lumpur.
These partnerships have helped to advance Singapore’s diplomatic efforts, and provide Singapore with greater insight into other countries’ views on international issues.

Abstract
Indian mustard Brassica Junce is a promising bio-fortified crop that can be utilized for the detoxication and reduction of toxic heavy metal As from contaminated water. In the current study, the role of exogenous application of various exogeneous antioxidants was assessed on growth and arsenite [As(III)] detoxifcation in mustard at the seedling stage.The exogenously applied antioxidants included, sodium selenite, vitamin E, ascorbic acid & glutathione. All the antioxidants significantly @P ≤ 0.05 increased growth, biomass production, root : shoot ratio and total root length, while reduced As accumulation in roots. The exo-application of vitamin C and asorbic Acid significantly improved the As detoxicating potential of plants, by enhancing the activities of As methyltransferases and GSH reductase respectively. Exogenous selenium also enhanced As",106,199,0.6545454545454545,8.407788596944448,0.9169959317147591,0.037431643418128865,0.8933333333333332,0.8859574468085107,0.8365458905746104,86.85877741989448,93.13333333333334,84.21987804878049

The Indian Defence forces have been in a state of near collapse for the last few years. It has been a long time since they got any significant upgrade in their equipment and weapons. There are several reasons for this. Firstly and most importantly, we are a country where there is a lot of corruption and mismanagement, which results in very low budgets and low equipment. Secondly, there are very few countries which are willing to sell us their advanced weaponry. Finally, even when we can buy weapon, our country does not give enough attention to defence.
We can see that we have a serious problem with the Indian defence forces, and we should all do something about it. Our country needs a strong defence, as our neighbours and friends are all building up their armies and navy. India needs to take advantage of this situation and start building a modern and powerful army. We can start by building",111,180,0.532608695652174,7.22465585158996,0.879199225413421,0.05333796535831585,0.8857142857142858,0.8702499999999997,0.7976955381145922,65.96823872186468,62.733695652173914,55.29268684531842

Essential Elements Of India'S Defence Offset Policy: A Critique
The Indian government' s Defence Exports Policy, 2008 was introduced on December 18,2009 in the context where the country had to deal with the aftermath of the global recession that had a devastating effect on the world economy. The policy document, as the title suggests, was aimed at boosting the Defence exports by way of offering various incentives and concessions to defence equipment vendors for their participation in India'"" Defence Procurement and Acquisition Process (dpp)"". This study examines this policy and tries to assess the extent to which it has been a success for India, by examining various facets of it such as its objective; its impact as per various parameters; the implementation of various provisions of this Policy; and, the challenges before this regime. This paper will also examine the role of Defence Industrial Development Organisation [DIDO], which is responsible",115,188,0.5945945945945946,8.087360843031885,0.900413788502988,0.04392530581137765,0.8742857142857143,0.8636024844720498,0.8243894422765228,74.20619316785451,75.34054054054054,69.78449848024317

in the meantime, the western nations have spent their money on social programs and are not spending the money they should be on maintaining military capabilities. in 2003 the usa spend about 2.9% and canada about the same.

Abstract
South Asia has the potential to witness a proliferation of missile capabilities in the near future, which will have serious implications on regional stability. This report provides an overview of the missile and missile defense systems in South Asia, including missile threats, missile defenses, and regional missile programs. It also provides a historical background of ballistic missile development in India, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Iran, Turkey and Egypt. In addition to providing a detailed account of South Asian missile arsenals in terms of their range, payload, accuracy and reliability, the report also examines the various types of indigenous and foreign missile production programs undertaken by South-Asian countries.

In a landmark judgement on Wednesday, the Supreme Court of India declared the offence of rape within marriage to be a ""civil offence"" and not a crime punishable by law. The judgement, delivered by a bench of Justices Ranjan Gogoi and B.S. Chauhan was based on a review of the provisions in the Indian Penal Code of 1860, and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013. 
The Indian Constitution, in Article 15(1), guarantees equal protection of laws to all citizens irrespective of their “creed, race, caste, sex, place of birth”, or marital status. This has been interpreted to protect all men and women, regardless of caste and creed, from all forms of discrimination, including in respect of gender. As a corollary, a woman in a marriage is protected against sexual offences committed",119,191,0.553072625698324,7.399607418244165,0.885825736146461,0.05067985451491177,0.8228571428571428,0.8283870967741945,0.7736269276435858,48.72313084112149,50.374301675977655,44.44756169212691

It is time to take stock of India'S foreign affairs. The recent visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to China, Japan and South Korea has been described as “India’s best foreign trip” by many observers. But how true is this assessment? Is the Modi government' s recent foreign tour a sign of ‘new’ India or 'old' India? The answer is: both!
In the 1980s and early 1990, India was a country with no foreign friends. It had a 100 per cent negative image and was seen as a threat to the regional security. This was the period that saw the assassination of Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards, the hijack of Indian Airlines aircraft by terrorists, and bomb blasts in major cities of the country.

indian army is a disciplined force but not in the sense of an army that has been disciplined by force. this was an important lesson learnt by the defence minister when the army had to be called in after the anti-sikh riots.
this is not a force that needs to have the discipline imposed by external forces. it has its own internal system. the system is built on discipline, which is the foundation on which the other qualities can be built — qualities like self reliance, initiative and creativity. in fact this is one of the best examples of how the internal discipline can produce results that are better than the results of a discipline by a strong external force (like the british).
the discipline in this case is internal and this discipline has to emerge on its basis and not be imposed externally. there has also to a be an acceptance by all the stakeholders, particularly the leadership of that discipline. discipline is an essential",124,197,0.4479166666666667,6.206515393788477,0.8472375116015547,0.0669042202921177,0.8285714285714285,0.8211904761904759,0.7270968188147591,44.60656688710988,41.614583333333336,39.318568232662194

The humoral immune response of adult Indian river shrimp, Macrobrachiun malcomsoni to various bacterial and fungal pathogens was evaluated. A total of 14 serum samples from the 7th to 12th instars of this shrimp collected at different periods from 4 to12 weeks after hatching and from a number of different water sources were screened. The results show that a large number (70%) of serum contained antibodies that were specific for at least one of the bacterial pathogens studied. However, only a few serum ""reacted"" with two or more of them. In addition, a very low frequency of antibody production was seen against the pathogenic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium verrucosum. It may be concluded that these two shrimp serums are not useful as a diagnostic aid for the detection of bacterial or fungous pathogens.

From 1947 to 2008, India has witnessed a number of social and economic changes and has gone through three major wars with Pakistan (1948; 1961; and 1971) and China [a] in 2021. This paper provides an analysis and comparison of India’s military expenditures with respect to other countries. We will also look at how India is spending its defense budget and the factors that drive its military spending. Finally, we will provide a brief comparison with other emerging and developed economies.

He also said that he has asked the Army chief General Bipin Rawat to look into this issue. India's defense budget in US dollar terms has more than doubled since 2002.

The Indian defence industry has been a significant beneficiary of the FDI policy of India since the 1990s. It was one of those sectors where the government permitted 100% FII / FIPB approval route for investment. This resulted in inflows of FPI from abroad and increased foreign ownership. For instance, between 2013 and 2021, FFPI - foreign portfolio funds – invested about Rs 2,50,000 crores in the Indian Defence sector.
Foreign direct investments from China are growing. Between 2004 and January 31, 2031, China’s share in Defence and Aerospace sector was 9.2%, which increased to 13.4% by April 1st,2022.

In the context of the growing importance of international terrorism and the proliferation of weapon of mass destruction and related materials the security and strategic interests of India are becoming more complex. In order to address and handle these complex and dynamic situations there is a requirement of a holistic view of security.
With the changing scenario, it is imperative that the Indian Armed Forces be made to respond in a manner in which they are able to meet the challenges of present and future scenarios. As a first step, the concept of ‘High Defence Management with Indian Characteristics’ [HDMIC), was developed. A high defence manager is the one who has a broad vision of how the armed forces should be organised, trained and equipped; and who is able and willing to provide a lead to the system to evolve and improve itself. The HDM-IC concept evolved out of an assessment of Indian needs and capabilities to ensure that India is better able than at present to deal with complex threats",137,200,0.5656565656565656,7.959493410609457,0.8922580580571382,0.046912341598469014,0.8514285714285714,0.8441379310344831,0.7792391648436605,58.6874153932461,60.474747474747474,52.13223465640846

Abstract
This study is aimed at evaluating the impact of employee retention and training (training) practices on employee attritions / retention. The study was conducted in 4 PSUs - one in each industry i.e. 2 each in manufacturing and services sectors. A total sample size of 150 employees from each PSU were taken for the study. Data was collected through questionnaire surveys, structured interview and focus group discussion. Statistical tools used were analysis of variance, regression and t- tests, to analyse the data.
The study findings suggest that employees have positive perceptions about the training programs provided in these PSUS and also about their employer and job security is a major factor that influences employees to leave the organization. Further it is also observed that training is one of the important tools in retaining good employees and the PSIs which provide training to their employees tend to be more productive as compared to those who do not provide trainings",147,189,0.5751295336787565,7.9899548333105095,0.8948902618742871,0.04598866880802219,0.88,0.8849704142011835,0.8009084778481015,58.3875539125077,63.89119170984456,66.6843910382945

The restructuring has been proposed in two parts: in the first, the army is to be separated from the other three services, which would then be reorganised, and the second is the setting up of a new defence industrial base, including a private manufacturing sector in defence.
In a recent article in Foreign Policy, Mani Shankar Aiyar writes that ""the government is planning a restructuring of India’s defence industries which it sees as critical to India's security and prosperity"". The first step is in setting out to separate the Indian army and other services and make it a separate ministry. A new ministry would have “a more focused mandate for defence production, procurement and security of supply of weapons and ammunition"". A separate defence ministry is necessary to enable the government to",149,193,0.4897959183673469,6.857142857142857,0.8647686695258835,0.05899486194580842,0.8342857142857143,0.8388372093023253,0.7539352149954536,46.22850678733032,50.775510204081634,53.37159329140461

The Indian armed forces are among the few in the world that are able to develop indigenous military hardware, weapons, and platforms to meet current and future challenges. These systems are critical assets for the nation, which are developed by the DRDOs of India.
A quality management system is necessary in such an environment to ensure the quality of products and process outputs, thus enabling the development of a strong and efficient industrial base for defence and security. However, a recent study by a reputed consulting firm found that only 20 out of 120 DRDos and defence PSUs have implemented and/or certified to an ISO 9001 quality standard. This paper is an attempt to analyse this issue in greater detail and suggest possible solutions for it. Using an extensive literature review, it finds that DRDs and DPSUs are lag",150,180,0.6011560693641619,7.906973581204937,0.9012474481553179,0.04412444931613597,0.88,0.8826845637583883,0.8167860145960208,83.11050156739812,78.01734104046243,69.76085972850679

I am not against the idea of a human battery, but if we are using humans as a source of energy, it is not a bad idea to use it for other purposes as well.
If you can use a battery like this to recharge your laptop, why not use the power from a person's body to power a laptop? This could be done by using an electroplasma generator. This device is made from the body' s own cells and can be used to make batteries for your car, laptop charger, etc.. I am sure that there are many ways to harness this power and make them into something useful, like making batteries. If you are looking at a future where we need batteries to run our vehicles, you will need to have the energy stored in something other than your own battery.

Indian defense,a phased approach to india's missile defence planning,"a phased approach to india's missile defence planning
In the late 1970s, the Indian government decided that India’s security required an independent nuclear deterrent. The decision to acquire a nuclear weapons stockpile came after a series of incidents in which India was forced to rely on other countries to defend it from Pakistani nuclear attacks.
At the time, there were few options for India. India did not have the financial resources to develop its own nuclear technology, nor was India capable of building nuclear warheads without the help of an outside country. This was due to the fact that a significant percentage of the country’’ military equipment was manufactured in the United States at the end of World War II, making India reliant on Washington. In addition, India relied upon American technology to help develop nuclear weaponry. Finally, since the 1950’’, India had maintained an agreement with the U.S to buy its nuclear fuel. It was the combination of these three things that made India unable to build its first nuclear bombs.

About the Project:
The aim of this project is to understand the evolution and current status of Indian aerospace sector and the policies that have supported it over its life span. The project will look at various policy interventions and how these have impacted the industry and its evolution. It will focus on a particular period (1996-2015) which will allow us to look back and see how it evolved from a defence-oriented industry to a largely civilian and private sector dominated industry. As a result of its transformation the aerospace and defence industry is no more in the radar of policy makers.

Abstract
The present paper presents a novel approach to build a semantic annotated text corpus, based on a large number of documents, for the purpose of developing a classifier that can be used to classify the text documents based upon their semantics. The annotated data set consists of a set of defense related articles which are classified as positive/negative and a manually curated corpus based from a corpus mining tool. These two corpora are further used for building the semantic annotated corporal for use in a machine learning algorithm for developing an accurate classifier. In the present study, we use the LSI based approach for feature selection to select the relevant features to be considered while training the model and then, used a Random forest classifier to develop the classifier for both the corporals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperformed a number approaches used in the literature.",166,193,0.515625,7.144709581221619,0.8740131041451173,0.05517751852935216,0.8457142857142858,0.8397619047619052,0.7783143620576419,51.8858367826315,55.526041666666664,49.459325650874945

by Ananth Krishnan – The Indian Defence Review
A ballistic missile (or ballistic rocket).
The missile’s warhead is a nuclear, chemical, or biological payload that may be either conventional or nuclear.
Missiles can be classified by their method of propulsion. Missiles that are propelled by jet engines, rockets, and other chemical or mechanical reactions are known as ballistic missiles. Ballistic missiles have a range and payload capability that exceeds that of cruise missiles and bombers. They have been used in military conflicts since the 1950s, most notably in the Cold War era during the nuclear standoffs between the Soviet Union and the United States. The development of these missiles led both sides to devote large amounts of resources to developing countermeasures..

Abstract
With the introduction of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in the 21st century, navigation has become an important aspect in warfare. GNSS is a technology that provides highly accurate position and time information to the users and the military. The GNSSL - based positioning system provides accurate location information within centimetre level of precision over a large area within minutes of time, which is critical for navigation. In addition, GNSPL also helps to track the movements of objects within its range. Since GNPS is based on radio signals it can be easily jammed, disabled or destroyed.
The research work is to review the current GNSA capabilities of the country and assess the impact in case of any GNPA/GNPS failure on the operational capabilities and its potential impact on India. A review of various GNPPL systems available in other countries has been performed",174,186,0.6,8.049844718999243,0.9016310671484934,0.04361731570305321,0.8857142857142858,0.8933333333333332,0.8233141712925921,79.84198645598195,75.81111111111112,73.66932744565217

India and Central Asia Defence Cooperation (ICADC) is one of the most important initiatives of cooperation between the Indian and the Central Asian Countries. This initiative was initiated in the year 2006 and now has evolved as an effective instrument of security cooperation and peace-building in this region of critical importance for India and its Central
Asia. The ICADCs aim to contribute to peace, security and stability in a region where these are most needed. As Central Asians are a vital part and component of India s neighbourhood, the ICADs are an important initiative of strategic engagement between India, Central Asias most populous countries and one with which India is deeply linked culturally, historically and
geographically, through centuries.
The ICADS are being pursued as a framework for cooperation in four areas: 1) Capacity-Building and Training; 2) Military Cooperation;
3) Counter Terrorism Cooperation and; and 4) Border Management cooperation",175,197,0.5405405405405406,7.352146220938077,0.8821563778976689,0.05197825141606706,0.8799999999999999,0.8797515527950306,0.7940659846992366,61.04574223245109,60.097297297297295,59.441491596638656

India-Israel relations have taken a new turn in the wake of US President Barack Obama’s visit to India in July 2010. In fact, it was this visit that provided the impetus to the strategic cooperation between the two countries that is now at the peak of its development. Since then, Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh and his Israeli counterpart Binyamin Netanyahu have met on several occasions.
It was in this backdrop that in February this year, the first India-Israeli Defence Industry Conference was held in New Delhi, with the participation of a delegation led by Israel Defence Minister Ehud Barak and the head of the Ministry of Science and Technology and Space of India, Vilasrao Deshmukh, who is also a member of Prime Ministers Council on Defence, Security and Strategic Affairs.

In the last few days of December I had the pleasure of reading The Reunion of The Church. It’s a slim volume (~ 130 pages) published in India in 1952 and has recently been revised and reprinted in a limited edition. The book is by a Scottish Presbyterian minister, C. S. Johnstone, and is a very thorough and clear statement of an alternative model for ecclesiology for Reformed churches, particularly Presbyterian churches.
A few thoughts on the book:
- Johnstones’ thesis is very much a product of his time (“Church and Kingdom” is an expression that dates him). But the principles that Johnston outlines are not dependent on his particular theological or ecclesiastical commitments. They are sound and can be adopted by churches in many theological traditions. I am not an Arminian or an anti-Calvinist,",189,199,0.5531914893617021,7.5849795578905175,0.886936383924207,0.04971669671584159,0.8457142857142858,0.8714634146341464,0.8022271456072042,66.99573556179993,65.05851063829788,63.133219834007235

The first ever defence policy was adopted in March 1951, when the government of Jawaharlal Nehru announced that a national policy for defence would be formulated. This was a significant step towards strengthening the Indian Armed Forces. The defence forces then consisted of two armies – the army and the air force.

The covid- 19 pandemic has had a major effect on global geopolitics over the past twelve months, with the United States and its allies being at loggerheads with China on issues ranging from trade to human rights to technology.
But in the coming decade, the pandemic will likely have its own effect. It is clear that the covid has highlighted some of the world' nations' - most notably the US – weaknesses and exposed its fragility in many areas. As a result, some countries have already taken steps to address those weaknesses, while other countries will need time to make those adjustments.

1.1 Introduction
In the contemporary era ‘defense spending’ has been a matter of serious debate. While some argue that defense spending should increase to keep up with the ever increasing threat of terrorism, others believe that spending more on defense can be counterproductive and lead to a situation where defense budget is used for purposes other than defence like development of infrastructure etc. and the economy is not benefited.
Defence spending is also a source of concern for many developing countries like India, which has to balance the need for modernization of its military to meet the rising security challenges posed by China and Pakistan. It has a huge population and its defence forces are one of the largest in the world.

The Indian government is in a hurry to increase the defence procurement process to keep up with domestic demands. India is the world'S third-largest defence spending nation after the United States and China; but, it is still a distant third, with less than $50 billion in defence procuremets in 2008.

The Indian Defence Industry has come a long away from the times when it was considered as an afterthought. The Indian Government is now giving it priority, by setting up the Defence Acquisition Council in 2001, and has made a series of policy announcements and measures in the last decade which have helped the industry. However, much more can be done for it, in terms of making India self-reliant, which will not only save valuable foreign exchange, but also make the country’s military more potent. This is especially so in view of the growing strategic competition with China and its allies, as well as the continuing terrorist threat from across the border in Jammu and Kashmir. A strong defence industrial base is the only way to meet the threats of today.

The change from a non-military person to someone with a military background to head the Defence Ministry is important.

The first step towards the development of an indigenous capability is the establishment of a defence industrial base, including the manufacturing and assembly of arms and armaments. The Indian government has been pursuing an ambitious “Make In India” policy to encourage domestic defence production and reduce dependence on foreign defence firms.. In the 1950s and 60s, India's defence requirements were supplied by indigenous manufacturers such as the Aircraft Factory at Nasik. This will enable India to build its own defence infrastructure and capabilities, rather relying on the foreign suppliers for the entire spectrum of military requirements. It was also felt that in the long term, such an arrangement with Russia would enable Indian firms to acquire the requisite technology to produce sophisticated weaponry. A large number of countries around the world are seeking to modernise their Armed Forces through the acquisition of the best available technology. These offsets are a mechanism for ensuring that Indian defence companies get a fair share of business in return for",217,195,0.6042780748663101,8.263378392636577,0.90370668341329,0.042385576665933386,0.9028571428571429,0.909447852760735,0.8181000643740718,70.40785120060502,78.90374331550802,84.9878983461073

The study was aimed to identify the potential sources of stress in the field conditions and to understand the role of antioxidant defense in alleviating the stress conditions on three traditional rice cultivars of Jeypure region of Odisha. For the study, three land races of rice namely, Kshamal, Pundari, and Khandia were subjected to different types of abiotic environmental stresses such as salinity, drought, high temperature, submergence etc. The results of the present study revealed that the landrace Khamal showed the highest yield under drought stress condition, followed by Punda and khandi. Salinity induced severe reduction in grain yield and other agronomic traits in all the three indigenous land rases of khamil, kunda, an Pundi.

Indian defense,martial law and the defence of constitutional order in india,"martial law and the defence of constitutional order in india: a critical analysis of the concept of 'external emergency' under the indian constitution (2005-2007)
Abstract
The Indian Constitution has provisions to address the issues which may threaten the very existence of India. Such issues arise due to a threat to national security, war or external aggression against the State. A ""Constitutional Emergency"" is a state of law wherein the provisions of Constitution are suspended. This study is concerned with the issue of martial law which is defined in article 352 of Indian constitution. The concept and provisions relating to martial laws have been analysed in the article and it has been observed that the Indian military can be deployed in any area of country under certain circumstances.

In May 2008 the government of India and the People' s Republic of China entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Defence Cooperation which was upgraded into an Agreement for Cooperation in the Field of Defence in October 2020. On 5 May, India’s Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj, visited China and met Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe. India will also help China establish 'a high-end maritime military force' that could rival the Indian Navy, he added.

The Indian Ballistic Missile Defense System (IBMDS) is being developed to address a wide range of potential strategic threats to India. The IBMDS is expected to include a space segment, a ground segment and a command and control element.
In this paper, I argue that while the development of the IBMD is a welcome step towards Indian self reliance and strategic autonomy, the Indian government'a decision to base the missile defense system on Israeli technology is not the optimal choice available. I also contend that given the political drivers behind the current development, India is more likely to use this missile defensive capability to deter and contain regional actors, and the Pakistani response to this could be asymmetrical nuclear threats.",224,188,0.6283783783783784,7.644552909699114,0.9070256064465932,0.04284017586168714,0.9120000000000001,0.8841935483870969,0.8082771101032983,80.9485621709194,76.00675675675676,62.864579606440074

India’ s military and security forces were stretched to their limit in 2019, with the number of terror attacks rising and a border conflict with China continuing despite diplomatic efforts to find a solution.
But, despite the challenges, the armed forces and intelligence agencies have made significant progress in their efforts at protecting India’ military, strategic and economic interests. They have also developed a new mindset and have begun to think of themselves as partners of the country's development and progress. As a result of this new approach, Indian armed ‘forces have become more professionalised and more effective. The armed and the intelligence forces have been able to adapt to new threats. And, more importantly, India ’ armed agencies are becoming more integrated and better able.

The main aim of this study is to present a survey and a critique of literature on defence spending published during the first three decades of independence in India. This is done with the help of a detailed analysis of some 300 references to the “defence expenditure” and allied matters. The data are arranged according to time, topic, author and source. These data and the analysis are presented for the period 1860-1947.
A number of conclusions and observations, in general, are drawn from the survey. One is that there is little agreement among the authors as to how the defence budget should be measured. Some have taken the budget estimates of defence ministries, whereas others have used the estimates made by various agencies. There is no unanimity on how these budgets should reflect the reality of military preparedness, the actual expenditure on the army and other forces, and their relative importance to other sectors and services in the economy.

The Indian government is expanding its defence cooperation with other countries while at the same time it struggles to increase local manufacturing.
New Delhi: The Indian defence industry, already struggling with a lack of investment and expertise, has been further hampered by the government’s push for indegenisation, which has led to a decline in foreign arms exports since 2015, according to government data reviewed by., the research arm of The Wall Street Journal. The country is in talks with several countries for potential arms deals, but none of them will result in a major purchase.

The government of India has a long-term policy, which is to build a strong military and defense industry in the country so that India can be self dependent on defense production.
This is the ""Indian Defence Production (IDP)"" programme. This programme was first announced in 1940, by the then prime minister of Independent India, Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru. The aim was to make India totally self-reliant on the manufacture of defense products and systems. It was a very ambitious plan, as at that time, there were no manufacturing industries for defense goods in India. In 1957, the programme became a law in parliament. Since then, this law and many others have enabled the government and armed forces to procure defense equipment from India-based industries. However, since India is a big country, with a large population, and with many different regions, climates and terrains, it is difficult to equip all parts of the nation equally.

The purpose of this article is to explore the post conflict defence reform process in India after the 2001 Gujarat riots. The Gujarat riot was a major turning point in the Indian security establishment as it led to significant changes in defence policy and reforms. While it is widely acknowledged that post the Gujarat violence the government of India took a more proactive approach towards defence planning, the manner in which it has been implemented remains a matter of debate and criticism. This paper examines the nature of post – Gujarat reforms and highlights the limitations of the reforms that have emerged. These include the lack of strategic vision and the failure of institutional reforms at the level of military and civilian leadership.
It is important to note the role of political leadership in implementing reforms, as defence is essentially a political subject. Political leadership is critical in driving the change that the defence forces and defence industry require to meet the growing security needs. It is also important as the armed",230,186,0.5050505050505051,7.106690545187015,0.8708278457306402,0.05624335441538624,0.84,0.8475862068965526,0.7514136761259087,53.26804002630838,49.57575757575758,47.238565488565484

Abstract
The human microbiome plays a significant role in maintaining health, and its disruption can cause chronic diseases. The intestinal mucosal barrier is essential for maintaining a balance between the host and the microbial community. However, chronic colonic inflammation has been linked to the development of ulceration, a pathological state of colons that is accompanied by the loss of epithelial cells. Colonic ulcerations are a common complication of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) and are frequently accompanied in IBDs. Ulcerations in the large intestine are associated with the formation of reactive oxygen species. These reactive species may be a potential contributor to ulcer formation in inflammatory diseases, such as IBD and colite, because these conditions are accompanied with chronic oxidative and inflammatory status. Furthermore, the antioxidant system of the body protects cells from harmful",232,185,0.5875706214689266,7.81711869122942,0.8972674940050391,0.04570005681661267,0.8799999999999999,0.8635294117647063,0.8084515780323865,66.70292580862764,66.38418079096046,52.833977011494255

Abstract
Background: L.theobroamae is a pathogen of tea causing leaf brown spots and black leaf blight. In this study, the effect of benzathiazol (benzothaizole) as an inducer of phenylalanyl-amino acid 5-aminolaevulinate lyase [PAL(5AL)], a rate-limiting enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis, was examined using the gene promoter of PAL(T). The PAL induction was used to improve flavanol biosynthetic pathway in the plants by the introduction of exogenous PAL gene.
Results: In the present study it was shown that benzthiazolone at 1 mg/ml concentration increased PAL 4-fold. Expression of gene PAL was found to be up-regulated by benzolthiadine in a dose dependent manner. A maximum of 7-folds higher expression was observed when the cells",236,194,0.6352201257861635,8.009821015753255,0.910476965577647,0.04066646287184001,0.8933333333333332,0.8823703703703705,0.8235797096890655,80.46951219512195,80.0754716981132,65.83425797503467

the global transfer of high-technology is one of the most sensitive issues in international trade. the international transfer to the developing countries of such high technology is a matter of great concern because the developed countries want to prevent the diffusion of this technology to their adversaries. however, the transfer is an inevitable consequence of a free-market economy. therefore, to understand the nature of international technology transfer in the world it is necessary first to know the basic structure of world economy and the forces which act upon the technology in different countries. it must be noted that the total amount of transfer varies from country to country depending upon its technological strength and economic condition.
in the present world the main players are the u.s., the european nations, japan, and some countries like the korea and singapore. there has been a shift from the western world to some extent to east asian countries, particularly japan and korean in technology. but, in general, western countries retain their dominance",240,195,0.4975369458128079,7.088810304070324,0.8686131377262313,0.056939149673508695,0.835,0.8344134078212296,0.7354733988733572,41.55032509752926,43.20197044334975,39.86223674655047

The policy has been a significant milestone in the government's attempt to develop an indigenous defence and aerospace manufacturing industry. However, this policy also brought in a number of challenges that have been addressed by the latest version, ""DPO 2020"".
The new DPO — a major milestone for ‘Make In India’ initiative – has a new vision (i.e. 10x increase in manufacturing and defence exports and a USD 75 billion target market) and an action plan. It has addressed the following issues:

Foreign Direct Investment
In defence, FDI may have two types of benefits in the form of technological transfer and market share.
(1) Technological transfer: In a joint venture, the transfer of technology would be the prime attraction. The foreign partner may provide technology, which may not be available in our country. It also facilitates joint development of new products. (2) Market share: FPI may seek market expansion and may invest in production to gain market position. FFPI can also seek investment to meet the growing demand of the market
Problems:
The problem is that FIP may be used by foreign countries to obtain sensitive information about their military hardware. In 1958, a US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin had to pay a huge penalty ($ 20 Million) to USA for illegally exporting military information to Soviet Russia through India.

Abstract
The Indian Ballistic Missile Defence [BMD] project is a response to the growing nuclear threat from China. It was launched after the Pokhran-II nuclear tests by China in 1995 when there was a serious concern that the Chinese nuclear arsenal was expanding at a much faster pace than the Indian nuclear deterrent. BMD was envisaged to protect the country from such Chinese threats and to maintain the nuclear deterrence capability. The project envisions a three-layered BSD architecture which is primarily aimed at intercepting short-to-medium range missiles. This thesis examines the implications of India’s BMS on regional and global strategic balance. To this end, the research will",272,184,0.6407185628742516,8.279908588115264,0.9130196334206511,0.039132461431052944,0.8733333333333334,0.8855944055944055,0.8343541949749484,96.97407110303408,90.39520958083833,70.45719696969697

The India-Japan Ballistic Missile Defence cooperation has taken many turns. The most noteworthy is the fact that Japan’s request for an early warning system was turned down by India citing a clause in the Missiles Technology Control Regime (MTCR) that India is a member of. In 2011, Japan had requested India to join the US-UK-Australia MTCS, as a non-nuclear member – this was again declined. India then sought to have a more ‘flexible’ understanding of the MCCR by allowing Japan to access information from the Indian radars, which would in turn allow Japan, to develop its own missile detection systems, and not be dependent on the information provided by the United States. However, this has been rejected by both India and the U.S [1].

- In a previous microarray study we identified a number of genes that were upregulated in white mustards after challenge inoculation with Alternaria Brassicacola. Here, we present an update of this study, including a more sensitive micro array technology. - For the analysis, the expression data of 11 white-mustard cultivars, of which seven resistant and four susceptible to Alterna- tiona Brassicae- cola were used as experimental material. For each individual sample, two replicates were performed, one with and one without pathogen challenge. The results were validated using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. This analysis confirmed that the upregulation of several genes after pathogen exposure is specific for the interaction between Alternari- a Brassicarola and its host.

- The rupees decline was a consequence of high oil and commodities prices, high capital inflows, a large external account deficit and a rising current account gap. These are the reasons for the rupees fall, but the question which arises is why has the dollar appreciated. Is the appreciation a result of higher demand and supply of currencies. The answer is not quite correct, for it is the demand for dollars that causes appreciation of dollar and vice versa. This is because dollar is used as a benchmark for pricing commodity prices. It is therefore, the increase in demand of commodities for which the price has increased. In other words it means that there was more demand. As a currency it has its value. And the more the value of a particular currency, it will be more attractive for foreign investors and traders. So as we know that the higher the values the lesser is its cost",275,182,0.45263157894736844,6.239095750946101,0.8489283134581485,0.06629575329192372,0.8114285714285714,0.8077108433734937,0.7159591570830868,41.926859028751394,39.86842105263158,35.922054895459155

The Indian Army, like the Indian Navy and the Air Force, is a professional organisation. Its recruitment process is governed by the Defence Services (Entry Procedure) Rules. These were notified under Section 57 of the Army Act, 1950, which is the basic law governing the recruitment and training of officers and gentlemen in the army. The rules were made by a committee of senior army officers who were entrusted with the task by General V.C. Deshmukh, the then Chief of Army Staff.

India-China defence engagement in the new century
China -India relations: A road map
The Chinese and Indian economies are the fastest growing in Asia.
They are also the most populous, largest and richest countries in that
region. They are therefore natural partners for a stable and prosperous
Asia. China and India have an old friendship. This friendship was
renewed by the historic visit of the first Chinese Premier, Mr Zhao
Zhuangang to India in 1979. The ""special relations"" that have evolved
between the two countries over the years have been marked by
frequent high-level exchanges between the leaders, close political and
economic cooperation, and growing people-to-people contacts. Since then
the relationship has grown from strength to strength, covering all major
areas of cooperation. Today, both countries regard India as an important

Introduction: A Paradigm Shift in India’s Defence Relationship
The Indian Army is currently engaged in Operation ‘Rahat’ in Jammu and Kashmir against terrorist organizations, the most important of which is Pakistan’ Army’ sponsored Lashkar-eTaiba. It is widely believed that Lashakeraida and Pakistan are behind the attack on Indian military personnel in Uri. This is the first attack by terrorists in Indian territory on the Indian security forces since the Kargil conflict in 1999. The attack was a clear message to India that Pakistan-based terrorist groups were still active on India soil and had not given up the use of terror to achieve their objectives.

Abstract
The India-Australia Security and Defence Relationship, as it has developed over a period of 60 plus years, was discussed in this paper. The paper began by reviewing the history of Indo-Australian Defence Relations, with particular reference to post 1990. In the first 30 years of bilateral relations, Australia had been a major provider of military assistance to India, particularly following Independence in 1947. However, after 1972, when India's relations with the USA were normalised, the bilateral military ties began to deteriorate as Australia became a close ally of the US and its military links with India diminished. Following the end of India?s nuclear tests in May 2008, Indo Australian bilateral defence ties were revived and the relationship has grown steadily. Australia has now become one of key",283,181,0.5617977528089888,7.495316889958614,0.8887229930182067,0.0494472173494836,0.8971428571428571,0.8981818181818189,0.7979238298284013,67.30763524611879,66.33707865168539,62.10405927835052

The Indian Navy is a major force in the Indian Ocean, and it has a large presence in Malabar, the western coast of India. The Indian Army has its own independent military, but has close cooperation with the Malaysian Armed Forces, especially in training.

• ""What is the scope for EU-India defence relations?""
This question is addressed through a historical overview of Indo-European relations. In addition, it is assessed whether the current level and scope of the EU's involvement in the military domain, in comparison to other international organisations (NATO, OSCE, ASEAN) is appropriate. It is argued that the European Union – India strategic partnership is a good basis to further improve the defence dimension of EU engagement with India.
2. EU’s approach and engagement in defence and security cooperation
The European security and defence policy has been developed in an incremental fashion and is characterised by three phases. The first phase 1999-2003 focused on civilian and police aspects. From 2004 and on, the security dimension has become increasingly important. At present, a more holistic approach to security is under development. This includes a wider scope and a stronger political focus on security",288,199,0.5404040404040404,7.604158883350106,0.8836219516411599,0.05067262257133251,0.8457142857142858,0.8487356321839076,0.7946718411505218,54.70209316448362,54.01010101010101,53.5186974789916

INDIA TO HELP IRAN BUILD NUCLEAR REACTOR:
India is expected to assist Iran in building a nuclear power reactor in Bushehr, in a move designed to boost bilateral ties.
Iran and Russia signed an inter-governmental agreement for building the Bussehr nuclear facility on Tuesday. Iran would supply Russia with enriched uranium for 15 years. In return, Russia would build the nuclear reactor and train Iran’s nuclear technicians. The two countries signed the accord after talks between Iran and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. “This accord will help us to achieve our national goals,” said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qazizadeh Hashemi in Tehran. He said Iran had been seeking the help of other countries for the last four years to build a second nuclear plant, but that it had finally found a country that was ready to help.

Abstract
India and Russia have had a long history of bilateral relations, which has been marked by a mix of cooperation and competition in areas spanning a range of interests. This research aims at studying the bilateral security partnership between India and Russian Federation during ‘India-Russia Summit 2018’ with a focus on the economic and security dimensions of this partnership. In particular, this study is an attempt to analyze the nature and scope of the Indo -Russian defense and military cooperation, the role played by the defense industries in the development of military technologies, security challenges that India faces and the security concerns of New Delhi with regard to Russia. The study also examines the extent of strategic cooperation between the 2 countries in economic sectors other than the defence sector.

India has been a “strategic pivot” — an important part of US military plans in Asia-Pacific. The US has spent over USD 100 billion in arms purchases since President Obama took office, and India is now its top recipient of arms, accounting for a fifth of its total arms deals. But the Indian military remains under-equipped, underpaid, ill-prepared and underfunded.
This article is based on the findings of a year-long study – ‘India: The Strategic Military Pivot in the Asia Pacific’ -- which was commissioned by the Centre for the National Interest in Washington DC.

It seeks to discuss the reasons why the concept of 'battery and its implications are not well understood by the judiciary and law makers. It also discusses the difficulties in establishing the battered women syndrome by looking at the relevant provisions and their interpretations by different Courts of law and the possible reasons there for. The paper further suggests that the existing provision in the Indian Penal Code 1860 [for the offence of cruelty towards wife] can be amended to include the term “battere dwoman” and can also suggest some other remedies for battered wives to help the women in their difficult situations.",293,185,0.5935483870967742,7.389617825902989,0.896570975522118,0.047220712992594775,0.8666666666666667,0.8766412213740463,0.7896790482077242,74.17096219931271,65.9483870967742,65.59988360250254

The US has long been seen as the ‘poster child’ of the liberal international order, which seeks to create a rules-based international system, promote liberal values, and maintain peace and security. This vision has been largely supported by US allies and allies-in-arms in Europe, North America and Asia. But the US-India alliance has become a test case for this vision in recent times. The two countries are seen by many as natural partners in the quest for global liberalism, with their shared values of democracy, pluralism and secularism underpinning their respective visions. However, the relationship has not always been an easy one. In fact, it has seen some of its worst days since the end of World War II.

Description
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of the defence innovation and technology ecosystems (DITEEs) in China and India to understand the factors that have enabled them to grow as strong technology powerhouses. It identifies the key elements and best practices that India could learn and leverage from China in order to develop a strong domestic defence ecosystem that will be able to support the growing aspirations of its defence and security sector. The study also provides recommendations to the Indian government for creating an enabling environment that would encourage more private sector participation and facilitate innovation in defence.

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors behind the recent rapid growth of defence-related cooperation between the United States and India. Using a case analysis approach, the paper argues that the main factors that led the two countries to engage in a closer defence relationship are their common interests in maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific regional security environment, and their shared concern that China has a rising power in the region. The paper concludes with recommendations for the next US administration on how to continue and expand this cooperation.",299,189,0.6301369863013698,7.613974175141785,0.9073325646033857,0.04281530858009208,0.8720000000000001,0.8577049180327877,0.8095817764802805,73.77935943060498,73.77397260273973,56.49958228905597
Indian defense,india's defence budgeting: lessons not learnt,"india's defence budgeting: lessons not learnt
In the wake of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, India' is expected to increase its defence budget by around 10.7%.
The rise is a direct result of growing security concerns, and the realisation that the Indian military is ill -equipped to deal with the threats to national security.
However, while this may seem logical, there are many who are sceptical of how effective the additional funds will be, particularly in the context of a large military establishment, which consumes the lion' s share of budgetary allocations. In fact, according to a report prepared by an NGO, a third (33 %) of India ’s annual budget of Rs 1,20,000 crores is currently spent on the armed forces, with only 7 % of these funds being used for modernisation. The rest are used to pay for salaries and pensions, maintenance of military equipment and infrastructure",300,187,0.6242774566473989,8.21108794971282,0.9085709863814767,0.040852158269083574,0.8999999999999999,0.8885906040268459,0.8059635184968255,83.08111806657234,84.10982658959537,80.65940454893943

Indian defense,"offset contracts under defence procurement regulations in india: evolution, challenges and prospects","offset contracts under defence procurement regulations in india: evolution, challenges and prospects
Defence Offset is the mechanism under which the Indian government encourages foreign vendors to set up facilities in India for the manufacturing of defence equipment and components. It was introduced as a policy to encourage the development of India’s defence manufacturing capabilities, to provide employment in the defence industrial sector by leveraging the strengths of domestic industries and to promote defence exports in order to achieve self-reliance in military equipment.
In 2007, the Cabinet decided that all offset contracts for equipment procured by the armed forces would be made mandatory with the offset obligations being incorporated into the contract. The Offset Policy - 2015 provides the basis of implementation of this provision. Offset obligations are mandatory in case of foreign defence acquisition, and voluntary if the procurement is from a domestic vendor. As per the Offset policy, all the offsets contracts are required to be registered with Ministry of Defence. Further, offsets are to cover manufacturing activities, research and development and services.

This dissertation will examine the impact of Tibet in the 21st Century on the defence, foreign, and security interests of India. Tibet has historically been a significant factor in determining India’s position and interests in China and the world. The ‘Tibet Card’ that the Indian government can play in order to achieve its ends in South Asia and beyond has been in decline since the end of the Cold War. China is now a major world power with global interests and a large, modern military and has emerged as a strategic rival to India as well as the rest of Asia.
In particular, Tibet serves as an example of how the Chinese Communist government uses a policy of ""strategic reassurance"" to manage foreign relations with countries around the globe and to protect its interests at home and abroad. This policy has become the norm in international relations. It is a strategy that seeks to establish China as “a responsible power, a partner",306,192,0.5153061224489796,7.214285714285714,0.8743880750620311,0.05479838247898555,0.8628571428571429,0.8627906976744182,0.7814788070006389,58.56135782163743,61.90816326530612,55.86077558804831

India has been an exporter of military technology for a long time, but in recent times it has taken a different turn towards imports of defence technology. With the advent of economic reforms in 1990s India started to import a lot of arms from the western world.
In 2000, the government started the Defence Acquisition Process which was aimed to develop the Indian Defence Industrial base with the assistance of the private sector. This was also aimed at making the defence procurement process transparent and efficient so that India can become self-sustaining in the field of Defence. However despite the various steps taken by the present government to boost the self reliance of Indian industry, there are many issues that stand in India's way of becoming",307,191,0.5698924731182796,7.772297096131725,0.8923967014264812,0.04741250709658292,0.8685714285714285,0.8970370370370369,0.8062790513246766,66.97170656951191,64.41397849462365,65.47213254035684

“Defence imports, especially arms, is not a matter of national pride for us. They are the result of our past. We must be able to produce our own arms,” he said.
Asked whether the import of arms would not go down in case of peace, the minister said the country was ‘still in transition to achieve peace’.
When asked whether India was in talks with Russia to buy the advanced S-400 Triumf air defence system, Mr Singh, who was here for the second day of the India-Russia summit, said talks were on. “We have a very important military relationship with them.”

Abstract
This paper aims to analyse the price volatility for defence sector stocks traded on the Indian stock exchange by using Bollinger Band (BB). A simple volatility analysis model has been developed for this study. The paper uses daily closing prices for the selected stocks from January 2000 to March 2010. It has also been observed that the BB bands are wider in the bull market conditions as compared to bear market condition. This is evident from the higher standard deviation during bull phase.

India is a vast country with a population of more than 120 crores. It is the 2nd largest populated country in the world, with the largest youth population in 10 of the countries in Asia. India has many security threats and challenges. There is an urgent imperative for a paradigm shift in India’s defence policy. The existing security environment is very complex and dynamic. This paper analyses the existing defence challenges of India. In the present day, there is much need to reimagine and re-conceptualize our defence architecture. A case is made for creating a Chief of Defence Staff in our Defence Structure with appropriate mandate, powers and authority to provide a unified, coordinated and holistic approach and leadership for defence.",317,182,0.554140127388535,6.943355894868313,0.8832458489123913,0.05316916506613213,0.8533333333333334,0.8622556390977445,0.7731222963952764,46.67212355842112,50.038216560509554,48.32402410505487

Abstract
This paper presents a case for use of convenience foods based upon a traditional Indian diet to provide nutritional adequacy at reduced costs of food preparation for the defence personnel.

An Analysis

The Indian Defence budget for 09- 10 has received considerable attention, both
in the media, and in the blogosphere for the increase over last years allocation,
as well as for some of the key items.
While the 08-09 allocation of Rs 1.04 lakh crore ( 2.8 % of GDP) was an increase
of 15.3 %, the current allocation is an addition of nearly 20 %. This increase has
been possible primarily because of a significant jump in military spending from
Rs 75,000 crore in 06-07 to Rs. 97,900 crore this year. While the allocation for
capital expenditure in FY-2008 was Rs, 71,500 crore,",328,181,0.5714285714285714,7.091242083423347,0.8888979444302765,0.05078903002447464,0.8266666666666667,0.8310769230769233,0.7833962773542491,51.85848252344417,52.44155844155844,42.845027515723274

Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between defence spending, economic activity and per-capita income for India and Pakistan. The study uses a panel data analysis with fixed effects model. Using the panel dataset of 1995-2013, the findings of this study provide support for the ‘crowding out’ effect of defence expenditure (i.e., the negative impact that increased defence budget has on the private sector). This means that a 1% increase in defence spend reduces per capita income by 0.1%. This relationship is found for both India, and for Pakistan, even though the former has higher economic output. Further, this result is robust to different sample specifications and estimation techniques. This result holds for all the sub-periods and all specifications examined. It is argued that",331,187,0.5621621621621622,7.6462320697756,0.8896694123473259,0.04866441578750215,0.8514285714285714,0.8633540372670807,0.8080932446313072,61.666666666666664,62.31891891891892,62.60035052012664

The paper identifies the various steps in the acquisition cycle, the institutional framework within which the process takes place and the role of various actors in this system, and discusses the major lessons learnt from it.
The paper begins with an overview of the evolution of defence systems in India and a brief overview on the current state of affairs of India-US defence cooperation. This is followed by an analysis of US defence procurement, with a focus on its acquisition processes. An examination of key areas where the two systems can benefit from each other is done to highlight areas for future cooperation, while highlighting key differences.

I was amused by this comment at the time – and perhaps even agreed with the sentiment - but now I find myself coming closer to agreeing with it.
It is now nearly 20 years since the Kargil conflict and the Indian army is still without a formal strategy for countering cross border threats. It is also 10 years after the end of the IPKF and nearly a decade after India withdrew the bulk of its forces from Sri Lanka and it seems that the strategic vision of Indian military planning is as confused as it was at that time. A few weeks ago I wrote a short piece for",340,185,0.6413043478260869,8.699075413138932,0.9148117726100222,0.03761372174154738,0.88,0.8840000000000003,0.8556191449589232,93.2915766738661,92.97282608695652,77.14094362255098

Defence Procurement: What is DPP (Defense Procurement Procedure). The DDP is the most important defence procurement procedure and the main document which governs the defence acquisition process. The Defence Procurement Manual 2013 : A Guide for Procurers is a compendium of the policies and guidelines relating to defence procurements by the Ministry of Defence. Defence acquisition is responsible for procurement of various items required for military operations. This is done by procuring these items from the Indian private sector and foreign suppliers. Procurement of items through this process is also done through the Defence Public sector undertakings. In the recent years, India’s defence forces have been facing severe shortages of a variety of weapon systems and platforms. These shortages are not only because of inadequate production in the private and public sector industries, but also because there are a lot of procedural bottlenecks. It is in this context that the",341,184,0.5384615384615384,7.0,0.8793272064796496,0.0541646903634966,0.86,0.8628965517241378,0.766426852720292,49.44611882897732,52.59171597633136,48.31219681219681

Abstract
Stinging nettle (Urtica urens L.), the most potent of all stings found in the family Urticaceae is the major cause for urtica related skin allergy. The plant has been known as a medicinal plant for the treatment of various diseases. In the present article, phytochemical constituents and the antioxidant activity of U. urensis are studied. Antioxidant activity was carried out by using DPPH and FRAP methods. Phytocompound analysis was performed by Gas chromatography-Mass spectroscopy & HPTLC-UV and FTIR. Urena-1, a phenylethyl amine was identified as the dominant constituent in U-root extract. A new compound named as ursol, which has 3,7,13-trimethyl-3-oxatricosa-7-ene-2,5-dione skeleton was also isolated and characterized from U ",344,191,0.6496815286624203,8.140486221569747,0.9147048999065963,0.03884289521145565,0.8733333333333334,0.8685714285714281,0.8312469010154878,82.39191087916501,83.51592356687898,60.31283950617284

In the last three decades — from 1989 to 2015, the share of FDI in defence and security has remained at 7% of total FDi in India. However, this ratio is much lower in Asia (~ 3%) as compared to the rest of world (> 15%). The government has taken several measures to encourage FII flows into defence manufacturing in 2000, 1999, and 1955 but there has not been any noticeable Fii flow into the Indian defence industry till date.

Abstract
India is one of the fastest growing economy globally and has made significant progress towards economic liberalization since 1990. It has also seen an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) in its defense sector. However, the defense industry has been considered to be a strategic sector, and therefore, a significant barrier has remained in the way of foreign investments. This has not only hindered growth of Indian defense manufacturing sector but has created a gap in technology and capabilities in comparison with the developed countries. The present paper attempts to review the present status of FDI in defense in India and its trends, requirements and the forecast. A critical review of available literature, reports and data has enabled the authors to identify the factors responsible for the low F DI inflows into defense and to understand that there is a strong case for allowing F I DI in certain categories in Indian defence industry.",348,199,0.5483870967741935,7.479002866089018,0.8850357857086775,0.05065589715371274,0.857142857142857,0.8706172839506175,0.7859990988497827,66.62607598693975,62.36021505376344,50.31891971664699

This thesis is a study of the defence ties between India and Japan, and how these have evolved and are likely to develop. It is premised on the notion that a nation’s foreign policy is determined by its domestic political culture and interests. India’ s foreign policies, in a sense, are a response to its internal political situation and the nature of its external environment. This study has taken a long-term view of India-Japan relations and examined the genesis and evolution of these relations. An attempt has been made here to analyse and evaluate the bilateral security relationship, including its political underpinnings and its trajectory in the future.
The study focuses on how the security ties of two non-traditional powers, that are not in close proximity to each other, have developed over the past five to six decades and their evolution since the end of World War II. The study attempts to explore the factors which have contributed to the evolution and expansion of bilateral relations, the obstacles and challenges, if",349,199,0.5141509433962265,7.486150735203552,0.8758092638984701,0.05338469744946834,0.86,0.8763829787234034,0.7718363070405148,57.01347904429832,58.37735849056604,61.49352286558859

The Indian Navy is the third largest navy in the world. Vietnam is a fast rising maritime nation with its navy and coast guards growing by leaps and bounds.
With a population of 92 million and its economy growing at 8% a year, Vietnam’s maritime and defence forces are getting stronger as the nation continues to develop its capabilities. The Vietnamese naval force consists of a 12,000-strong navy, a coast guard with about 3,500 personnel, and the 1,200-member marine police. They maintain a strong presence in their waters, with patrols in coastal areas, offshore patrol vessels, aircraft carriers, submarines, frigates, corvette, minehunters, patrol boats and other vessels. It has also established a network of coastal radar stations to monitor the sea and has developed maritime surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities and a number of surveillance ships to patrol its coast and waters.

The Indian government'S Defence Policy, which had been in limbo since the 1990s was finally articulated by the then Defence Minister, George Fernandes, and was accepted with alacrity by his successor, Jaswant Singh. This document was presented to parliament in July 2002 and is known as ""Strategic Defence and Allied Review"" or SDAR. The document states that India' S security interests are'regional'. It says in the document, “India is not in a position to undertake a global role, but it is able to play an increasing role and responsibility in maintaining security in our own region and that of our neighbours.”
It says the government ‘will continue to pursue a balanced approach to security concerns. It will continue its traditional approach of pursuing friendly and peaceful relations with neighbours, both bilaterally and in regional organisations.""

The Indian defence forces are being increasingly burdened by an ever growing number of weapons and military hardware. The government has a responsibility to make sure that the defence expenditure does not get beyond the country’s capacity.
It appears that India’ s self–inflictive defence expenditures are growing by leaps and bounds. In 2005–06, for example, the total defence budget of India is estimated to amount to about Rs 300,000 crores, or more than 1 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). This is a 50 per
cent increase as compared to 10 years ago, and more importantly, 25 per-
 cent higher than the global average. It is not only high by any global measure, but
also a significant increase in a country which is yet to become a world power, with a
population of 120 cro- re. As India continues its march towards world",354,191,0.615819209039548,8.192941705230835,0.9063392916758577,0.04166451164062367,0.9199999999999999,0.9142483660130717,0.8380060542484601,82.06831395348837,90.10169491525424,86.53423658155289

The India-Bangladesh relationship has come a full circle. In 2006, the India’s ‘Look East’ policy had led to the signing of the Agreement for the Promotion of Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (APNU) between the two countries. This was followed by the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Dhaka, in February 2010. The Prime Ministers of India and Bangladesh have met four times since then, and the latest was held during the Indian Prime Minster’ s visit to Bangladesh on 15-16 October. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi have now set the tone and direction for India Bangladesh bilateral relations which is marked by a growing convergence of views in the field of foreign policy and security issues.
A few days before the PM’S visit, Bangladesh Foreign Secretary M. Shahidul Haque said that India “was the closest partner of Bangladesh in terms",358,200,0.6129032258064516,8.358885556217137,0.9063199470075244,0.04127760241735839,0.9085714285714286,0.8958024691358022,0.814462388477865,93.0,81.91397849462365,73.88319238900635

Vietnam and India are both members of the non-aligned movement. The two countries have also established the India-Viet Nam strategic partnership, a long-term comprehensive co-ordination.
The relationship between the two nations is not only bilateral but also multi-faceted. In order to promote and strengthen the comprehensive, long term, and all-round strategic co -operation between India and Vietnam, the Vietnamese foreign ministry has decided to send an official delegation to New Delhi to exchange views on bilateral ties, including the situation in the East Sea as well as international and regional issues of mutual concern.

As the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19, the need to strengthen bilateral defence ties between India and Malaysia has taken on new salience, not just to address the pandemic but also to deal with new realities and emerging threats, including climate change. Both countries are also looking at ways to further deepen defence industry linkages and enhance strategic cooperation through joint exercises and training. The recent signing of a Memorandum of Understanding ‘on the basis of strategic trust and friendship’ to deepen bilateral cooperation in the defence sector is",362,188,0.6043956043956044,8.153742483272113,0.903242568358954,0.04281167053192435,0.8914285714285713,0.885822784810127,0.8174252435855391,86.2995867768595,76.9010989010989,82.74902950310559

well, we can do what we've been doing for 40 years now and that is to sit back and watch. but the time has come for the united states and its allies to take action to counter this growing threat. i have long said that it was time to move away from a policy of containment and to go to an active policy that would seek to neutralise china's growing influence and power. we should now make a start with a military build-up in the area that will make china think twice. the us military",375,194,0.5396825396825397,7.419408268023741,0.882334229407988,0.051688005648197276,0.8571428571428571,0.8545454545454554,0.7829694219647643,53.7017637233067,58.370370370370374,52.75063920454545

The Defence Ministry is also working on a 100 per cent indigenisation plan under which all the arms and ammunition that are currently imported will be manufactured in the country by 2030. India’s defence production has witnessed a major shift, with the government’ s aim of 70% localisation in production of defence equipment, including military hardware and weaponry, by the year 2020 on the anvil. It is now aiming to manufacture 85% of the defence components in India. “We have a lot of capacity and capability. The government has been encouraging private and public companies to invest in defence manufacturing, but the private sector has remained hesitant to enter this field.

India'S Defence Spending Is Too High, Say Experts
By Pratik Kanjilal
NEW DELHI: The recent $6.3 billion deal to buy 126 combat jets from France is just the tip of the iceberg. India is likely to spend more than 10 times the amount to modernise its military in the next decade, a report prepared for the government by the Centre for Air Power Studies (Caps), a defence think-tank, shows.
The government has already cleared 20 defence deals worth 3.6 trillion rupees ($61.8 billion). “This is a good beginning but it will have to pick up pace and become more strategic, especially with China’s rise and Pakistan’S nuclear programme,” says the author of Caps’ report. The report, based on an assessment of India’ S defence requirements, says India will require 1,200 fighter aircraft, 900 attack helicopters and 700 subm",382,198,0.6704545454545454,8.894584665044027,0.9226766061057042,0.03443462822659767,0.9028571428571429,0.8973684210526316,0.860607121111529,103.7474931018238,120.7784090909091,104.66363102232668

The United States is in the process of rebalancing its security policy towards Asia, a rebbalance that is being driven primarily by the growing economic, military and demographic power of China.
In this context, India – the United State’s third largest arms supplier after Russia and Israel - has emerged as a key strategic partner to the US in Asia. This has been evident in recent years as the bilateral defence ties between the two countries have grown. The two governments have concluded two landmark defence cooperation agreements since the end of the Cold War, and have been actively engaged in joint training and exercises. India is now the largest importer of US arms. Moreover, as part of a larger trend across the Asia Pacific, US and Indian military forces are increasingly engaged bilaterally through the 'two-plus-two' ministerial dialogue and other military-to-military initiatives.

Indian defense,an overview of indian defence industry: a transformative perspective,"an overview of indian defence industry: a transformative perspective
by ravi shankar (ravi_shank@rediffmail.com)
Indian defence has witnessed a series of transformation during the last decade. The transformation from 'defence' to ‘defense’ was initiated by the then Defence Minister George Fernandes with a view to bring the armed forces under one umbrella. With the transformation, the defence research and design organisations – DRDO and ADE, were also merged as DRDE. A number of indigenous weapon systems were developed during this time.
In the post 9-11 era, defence became a ""frontier area's for Indian economy and the Indian armed services were called upon to play a role of national and international dimension. This resulted in significant increase in defence production. As a result of the new policy of export oriented production, India started making inroads into international market. For instance, in the field of armaments, indigenous products started being exported to countries like South Africa",385,199,0.5944444444444444,7.97530911974925,0.8998397191882809,0.04441160905614423,0.8457142857142858,0.8728205128205128,0.8157383190919596,65.48580462420131,65.37222222222222,62.51304567388621

In the wake of the recent spate of incidents of violence against women in Delhi, the Government of India has initiated a series of measures to improve its policing system. In addition, in the last year, India’s Defence Minister has announced that a new army chief, a navy chief and a chief of air force will take over from their predecessors. The current chief army staff, Gen. V.K. Singh, is set to be superseded by the current vice chief General Dalbir Singh in August. It is to the credit of this army officer that the Army’ first and most visible initiative in its battle against sexual violence has been the formation of special task forces to combat the menace.

in this scenario, the number of nuclear weapons of both the states would be same — around 150.
this is the status quo ante [the situation before the nuclear tests] and the most probable option. the only thing that may change is that, india is now also a nuclear-state. this is most likely, given that the two states are not going back to their respective pre-testing situation in terms of arms. there are other options, but these are the least likely ones. it is important to note that india and china have never had any nuclear war. their nuclear doctrines were ‘nuclear restraint’ till 2006. india’s current posture is ’limited deterrence‘. both states have",387,183,0.5274725274725275,7.115993439946571,0.87708346009673,0.05438613158713274,0.8228571428571428,0.8362025316455692,0.7703041409012783,43.86095100864553,45.362637362637365,43.54207778522847

The Indian Army’s Air Defence System (ADS) has been developed to provide a protective shield to critical assets. The ADS is a network of sensors and weapons designed to detect and track enemy aircrafts and missiles. However, the Indian Airmen have faced the challenge of integrating the AADS with other Air Force assets such as fighter aircraft and surface to air missiles, thereby making it a complex task to manage and operate.
India’ has witnessed a rapid growth and development of air assets and airbases. In recent years, India has inducted new aircraft such a fighter jets and multirole aircraft as well as helicopters. As the size of the fleet grows, there is also the need for the air bases to be expanded and modernised.

They show how India is using diplomacy to develop new relationships, build confidence and expand strategic cooperation with other countries in a range of areas including counterterrorism, nuclear safety, peacekeeping, and disaster response as well as arms sales. These articles also highlight India' s role in peace and security in South Asia and Southeast Asia. They conclude with an overview of how the country - in its new role as a middle power -- is seeking to play a leading role globally.

The Indian Ocean Region (IOR) has emerged as one of the most important theatres of power competition in the 21st century. India’s maritime engagement with the region is not limited to commercial or civil purposes, however, but also entails defence and security considerations. The Indian government, in its Look East Policy, has recognised the importance of India-Israel relations within its regional maritime strategy, which aims to strengthen maritime security in IOR. In recent years, India has sought to build upon its traditional ties with Israel in order to bolster its security and diplomatic engagement in East Asia.
India and Israel have developed their ties over decades; they are now both considered as the world’ s only liberal democracies. Their shared values have been at the foundation of their cooperation, with shared interests and perspectives on regional security challenges driving bilateral ties further. This partnership has been further consolidated as India seeks to diversify its diplomatic footprint",408,190,0.5876288659793815,8.184723008242214,0.8990747862574633,0.04411449314955049,0.9142857142857144,0.9058823529411762,0.8341841840628,83.39479536498771,87.4381443298969,67.76472701149424

Abstract
This work is an attempt to analyze and suggest ways through which the Indian Armed Forces could achieve carbon neutral status in the coming years. The Armed forces are a major consumer of energy and also a large polluter. In order for the armed forces to achieve a carbon-neutral status, there are many challenges that need to be overcome. These include a lack of political will, a poor knowledge base of the Armed force personnel about climate-change and energy-security risks, low levels of awareness and understanding of climate change and related issues among the general population, high levels and costs of fuel consumption, and a limited capacity to innovate and deploy new technology. This thesis provides a review of existing literature on energy efficiency in armed Forces of countries around the world. An attempt is also made to understand the factors that drive energy use in these forces.",409,194,0.583756345177665,8.19341074860961,0.8981164407030512,0.044404035298174604,0.8685714285714284,0.8744508670520227,0.8198601680201134,77.1500740408556,73.04568527918782,53.66920775149615

Description/Abstract
This paper examines the relationship between the British occupation of Persia from 1838 and Indian frontier policy from the Treaty of Amiens - the end of the war with France and the beginning of 'the great game'. It argues that there is a strong continuity in British policy in Persía and India during the 19th century that is based on the desire to safeguard Indian security. The paper concludes by discussing the relevance of this continuity to British imperial policy and security in the post-Cold War world.

Indian defense,"scraping the bottom of the barrel: budgets, organisation and leadership in the indian defence system","scraping the bottom of the barrel: budgets, organisation and leadership in the indian defence system
The Indian government has a long way to go before it can achieve what the Defence Procurement Procedure of 2008 (DPP) envisages. This is not an indictment of what we have today, but of where we need to be. The problem today is that the Indian defence budget – the biggest budget after the Central government - is still less than 10% of defence capital expenditure. Even if the 2% annual defence spending growth of recent years is sustained, it will take decades to catch up.
What is also clear is how difficult it is for the government to get this spending right. In fact, the DPP is the third Defence Acquisition procedure, each one more onerous than the previous. Yet, despite these efforts, India’s military capability has been falling. A lot of this is due to the fact that, in addition to being a large bureaucracy, defence procurement in India is an unwield",413,189,0.5544041450777202,7.702028533011032,0.8879163824451305,0.04903995061210181,0.8514285714285714,0.8615384615384614,0.7773221621474901,61.634787472035796,59.93782383419689,62.37664640324215

indian army chief’s usa trip may not affect india’ s defence cooperation with usa, but it is a reality check for the indian strategic community..
the visit of general rawat is not a visit in the normal sense as it has been done by the defence minister in previous years. it was a political visit. this is because the visit was preceded by a high octane political controversy in india over the purchase of the s400 missile defence equipment from russia. the controversy led to the resignation of a senior minister. in this context, the us president’ presidential address at the 73rd session of un general assembly and his speech before the joint session to congress were significant in many ways. these were not about defence and national security. yet, it can be said that they gave a hint of what is expected to come from him. he made it clear that he wants to make america stronger. america’ first priority is america",415,191,0.5661375661375662,7.783104751750395,0.891464014008455,0.04767749047779989,0.8571428571428571,0.8533333333333327,0.8029938119613609,55.86684782608695,58.04761904761905,51.766616482658634

In a previous blog post, I spoke about the bong middle classes and their consumption of cultural goods. I argued that the Bengalis are the quintessential cultural middle-class – their consumer habits reveal an affinity for a particular brand of culture, the ’bong-middleness’. This middle culture that they subscribe to, is a kind, gentle and accommodating one, which allows for multiple cultural influences to enter their life-space, but at the same time, it does not threaten their cultural identity.
The bongs have been described as “the only people in the world who have a class without a culture”, which implies that for the vast majority of the Indian diaspora, class is defined in terms of material resources that are available to them, rather than their culture. The bings have the luxury of being able to define and negotiate their own culture as their socio-economic position allows it, without feeling the pressure of any other",416,190,0.5376884422110553,7.585028893589194,0.8827809826170588,0.0509902170720762,0.8628571428571429,0.8770285714285714,0.7907884701358605,67.72582697201017,66.83417085427136,59.5653311965812

India’s military modernisation and expansion are a cause for concern in the region
In the coming years, India will be the fastest-growing large economy in South Asia. In the long term, a rising India could help stabilise and strengthen the South Asian region.
At the same time, however, this is also a period of intense uncertainty for India’ss security. The rise of China, and the potential for conflict on the Indian subcontinent, could lead to the militarisation of regional politics. This would have significant implications for the security of other countries - including Japan, the United States and Australia. To avoid a destabilising spiral, it is vital for all parties to understand how the current security and defence policies in India may affect the wider region and how they might affect their own regional strategies.

In a previous post I pointed out that the US has decided to increase its defense and security cooperation with Pakistan. In the past the United States has accused China of having a negative role in the Indo-Pak conflict. This time, however, the Chinese government has not reacted, as they are more interested in developing trade relations with both nations.
The US decision to expand the cooperation between the two nations could have a profound effect on the Indian government, who have always maintained that Pakistan is the biggest threat against peace and harmony in South Asia. It has already been reported that Indian officials were “furious at the decision”. The New York Times reports that “[w]hile the Obama administration has been seeking to repair a relationship that had deteriorated under President George W. Bush, some American officials privately expressed fears that closer security ties could undermine India-U.S. ties.”

Abstract
This thesis examines the evolution and current status of defence indegenization in India, a program that seeks to increase local production of defense equipment. India'a indenigenizing efforts began in the mid-1950s with the formation of the Ordnance Factories Board (OFB) and the Indian Ordance Department. However, these entities were primarily intended as research and development organizations rather than as manufacturing entities. It was only following a 1974 Cabinet resolution that OFB began manufacturing. Over the decades, the program has been a significant contributor to the development of a domestic defense industry in addition to providing critical capabilities to India. The thesis will examine the current state of indegneous production and how the indgenous program",421,195,0.632183908045977,8.339078479367938,0.9111126152317206,0.03967214058624792,0.86,0.8546666666666668,0.8255241916123949,93.95453963375593,79.48850574712644,61.83963750985028

The Government of India has a very strong focus on ‘Make in India’ which means that the Ministry of Defence is trying to increase the manufacturing content of defence equipment.
India has started the first phase of Make in Defence programme, which is focused on creating the infrastructure in the form of a Defence Manufacturing Zones and Defence Industrial Corridors. The Defence Ministry is looking closely on a few countries which are also working aggressively on defence manufacturing. These countries includes Israel, France, Germany & Japan. It is expected that these countries will share the expertise on how to build a strong ecosystem and infrastructure, and India will follow the same model and set up similar facilities across the country.

the defence minister of india has proposed reforms in the defence sector which include a “re-think in our procurement policy.”
this is a long overdue step, and i am glad that the current defence ministry is taking this important issue seriously.
but the problem with defence and military affairs is that it cannot be managed in a vacuum. the changes and reforms that we make to our system of defence management and procurement, need to take into account our national interests and the threats which we face. it is one thing to make reforms, but unless the reforms take care of our actual threats, they are of limited value. we need a holistic approach to defence reform. this is where the ‘china factor’ comes into the picture. in fact, india needs to learn the right lessons from its rival, not just from the western countries which have been its main trading partners and friends. china is now emerging in",428,183,0.5,6.892024376045111,0.8678970839418051,0.05797156656294826,0.8857142857142858,0.8783132530120482,0.7747632623359705,56.40408460977389,54.43157894736842,54.635543266893535

The fouling patterns exhibited by these egg mass species were compared. In all three cases, fouled eggs were predominantly deposited on shell fragments in the immediate vicinity of the egg clutch.

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to find out the status of English language courses offered for the officer trainees of the National Defence Academy. A qualitative research approach was selected. This study employed a descriptive research method to identify, explore and describe the issues that influence the implementation of an English Language curriculum at an officer training academy. The research was carried out by gathering data from the students, staff, and the course coordinators and teachers of NDAs and conducting in-depth interviews. To gather the data, a researcher-made questionnaire was administered to the respondents. Interviews were conducted with the staff of NDA and course instructors in order to gain a deeper understanding of their perspectives of teaching and learning English as a language course. Data analysis of both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of information was undertaken.

This is an abridged version of a report prepared for the India Foundation by Dr. Ajai Sahni and Dr S. Chandrasekharam (both retired from the defence forces and senior fellows at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi) on the need to build an industrial base for defence and security in India. [1]. The defence budget, which is already in short supply, needs to be increased. A 20-year plan for indigenization of defence manufacturing needs immediate attention. The government must also initiate steps to develop strategic industries for military needs – an “industrial complex”, if you will.
In other words, in order to ensure that India does not become the next victim of an arms embargo, or the victim, by the way its military operations go, of the arms trade, it has to start planning now, and in a big way, for its own defence industry and its supply of military hardware.

defencetalk.com
The challenges of the Indian defence market -- from the lack of indigenous manufacturing capacity to a complex procurement bureaucracy – have been well-documented. However, in addition to the obstacles, India’s defence procurement market also presents a number of opportunities.
One of them is the potential for greater participation of domestic industry. While this is a key goal of India's Make II programme, which aims to increase the local content in defence equipment and services, there are many challenges facing the domestic defence manufacturing industry that must be addressed. The Indian military’ s requirement for high-technology and sophisticated military equipment has created opportunities for the country’S defence industry in the fields of design & development, production, integration and testing. In particular, the industry will be able to leverage its capabilities in manufacturing, systems integration, software development/programming, and maintenance and repair to provide solutions to meet the needs of both the armed forces",440,199,0.5647668393782384,7.84599168316077,0.8914353142276398,0.047500312219032136,0.8971428571428571,0.8826035502958585,0.7929701781631396,59.926940639269404,64.70984455958549,65.13946472019464

The present paper investigates the relationship between dissent and rule of law in India during the rule under emergency rules in 1975-77. The paper examines how dissenting judges in the Supreme Court of India used the ""doctrine of necessity"" to challenge the legality of the imposition of these rules and how, in their judgments, dissent became a space for contesting the boundaries of political, legal and judicial authority.

Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to analyse the Indian law relating to mental health and insanity and to see whether there are any provisions under the Criminal Law that could be used for the defence. In this regard, this article will look into some aspects of the present mental healthcare system in India and its provisions with regard to insanity defence, which are not sufficient. The paper will try to look at the international law, particularly the law in the United Kingdom with respect to defence and the recent amendment of Section 106 of Cr.

In the 1940s, the United States and its Western Allies began to develop nuclear weapons. In order to maintain their power and control over India, Britain had to create a network of allies in India.

Thesis
This dissertation examines a key period in the history of Indian administration (1920-24) and British imperialism - a time when the Raj was at its weakest. It is concerned with the changing nature of British intelligence activities within the Indian empire. At the end of World War 1, Britain was in possession of one of its largest overseas territories. In the period between 1918 and 1922, the British government had to grapple not only with a vast number of domestic issues such as a labour movement, an economic recession and a constitutional crisis, but also the challenge to its authority of a growing nationalist movement. The result was a series of events, which have come to be known as the 'Rajput Scandal'. The Rajput scandal was the first serious crisis of imperial authority in British India. This dissertation will investigate the role played by the intelligence services in dealing with this crisis and",462,188,0.5445026178010471,7.525175895041185,0.8842629696962797,0.050738858959949125,0.84,0.8622754491017965,0.7833445813716761,56.574873249637854,49.86910994764398,54.97825670498084

by:
- The total expenditure incurred by the defence services in a year (the budgeted expenditure) and the total capital expenditure on the acquisition of new hardware & equipment by these services
(capital outlay for procurement of capital equipment).
It is, thus clear that even if one were to take the maximum capital outlays incurred in the last three years as capitalisation of defence outgo, it still does not add upto half of the budgetary expenditure. In other words, the ratio of expenditure to budget has increased significantly over the years.
The defence budget is a highly politicized subject. There is an almost constant demand for more spending in order to “catch up” with our neighbours, particularly in view of China’s aggressive posturing and its growing naval and strategic presence in our neighbourhood. While the demand does have its merits, we cannot lose sight of some of its consequences. The biggest of these is",463,190,0.5526315789473685,7.617500626155123,0.8869714120143601,0.04960105732290608,0.8685714285714285,0.8633734939759033,0.8044158654602555,59.23143350604491,65.72105263157894,61.18892770015525

The manufacturing sector in India has grown significantly over the years. India is among the most attractive markets for foreign companies in this sector.
In terms of market value, the Indian aerospace manufacturing market is estimated at $7.7 billion in 2018. This market includes manufacturing of aircraft components as well as MRO (maintenance repair and overhaul).
Aerospace and Defence are two important sectors for India to achieve its ‘Make inIndia’ vision and its plans for Atma Nirbhar Bharat 2.0. The sector has been identified as one of the key sectors by the Government of India (“GoI”) and will be accorded topmost priority. There are a lot of initiatives under various schemes of GoI such as “Make-In-India” to boost the manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Some of these initiatives include:

Indian defense,transfer of defence technology: exploring the avenues for india,"transfer of defence technology: exploring the avenues for india
Abstract
There is a need to develop a comprehensive technology transfer policy that would ensure effective transfer to the end users. This requires a clear vision of how the policy is to be implemented with appropriate institutional mechanism. The objective of this paper is twofold: to analyse the current status of the technology flow in the context of transfer of military technology from developed nations to developing nations; and to examine the possible avenues of technology development for India to become a technology provider country. To achieve this, the paper will first briefly examine why technology transfers are not happening, and then look at various options for technology acquisition. Finally, it will examine what the future holds for the Indian military in terms of future defence needs and technology.",467,190,0.5231788079470199,6.42892882429216,0.8708798381955191,0.05925724086474629,0.84,0.8274015748031488,0.7457662321554506,44.19696666132393,42.01324503311258,38.750517598343684

Introduction
The Defence Research and Development Organisation is a premier science and technology institution that has been at the forefront of indigenous technology development and indigenous defence manufacturing since inception in 1958. The DRDO, as it is commonly known, is one of the three wings of India’s Ministry of Defence that is tasked with the development, acquisition, research and development of all weapon systems and platforms for the Indian Armed Forces. Its other wings include the Defence Acquisition and Research, and the Military Engineering Services.
History
DRDO was formally established as a government-owned corporation in April 1979, with a charter to carry out research in defence and aerospace sectors. It was then renamed as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research – Defence Organisation & was placed",471,181,0.5872093023255814,7.701177801796536,0.8965760988437703,0.046263737461850724,0.8533333333333334,0.8621621621621619,0.8065863242549917,76.48672566371681,72.57558139534883,54.840062111801245
Indian defense,india's defence budget and expenditure management in a wider context,"india's defence budget and expenditure management in a wider context: an evaluation of the last ten years - by anupam sahu (research scholar, university of delhi)
The 2016 defence spending of India is estimated at 0.83 per cent of its GDP. This is lower than the average defence expenditure during 2008-12 (~1.3 per
cent), but higher than in many developing countries.
India’s expenditure on defence has increased substantially over the past decade, especially in the period after 9/11. But this increase in
defence expenditure is largely due to the rise in expenditure incurred on personnel rather than on capital and equipment. The share of capital
expenditure in defence increased only slightly. As a result, the defence-to-GDP ratio remained at around 2 per-cent for ten fiscal years, and is
still less than half of what China spends. In fact, China’ s defence /GNP ratio is almost ",472,196,0.553072625698324,7.399607418244165,0.885825736146461,0.05067985451491177,0.9085714285714285,0.9024516129032252,0.7991920224122468,65.69627364084639,66.29608938547486,55.60054875474884

A ship in distress at sea is a scene of horror. The life and death of a ship at the mercy of the waves are the most thrilling and dramatic episodes of naval history. This book tells the story of Indian Shipyard. Indian Navy had a dream of building her own aircraft carriers, submarines and other warships. In spite of this, the first warship made in India in the post-independence years was an American second hand vessel, namely the aircraft carrier Rajput, which India purchased from the US. It was not until 1964 that India decided to build an aircraft carrying carrier on her shores and she decided on the design to be used for this project, and the shipyards in which it be built and operated. Thus came into being the ‘INS Vikrant’, India’s first aircraft aircraft",474,186,0.5706521739130435,7.740702698132099,0.8924290857019751,0.047496497601331324,0.8514285714285714,0.85125,0.7993132851283381,59.97222465113647,58.84782608695652,49.86666666666667

Abstract
This paper examines the strategic partnership between Thailand and India from the perspective of defence convergence. The objective of the study is to assess to what extent the two countries have achieved convergence in the area of military cooperation. To assess the status of convergence, the paper draws upon the theory of strategic cooperation to analyse their defence relations. It argues that the convergence process has advanced at a rapid rate and that a new form of cooperation has emerged, one that is based upon a convergence of national defence priorities and interests.

The signing of a defence cooperation agreement between Singapore and India was a milestone in India' - the country has been looking at since the late-1990s
NEW DELHI -- The signing last week by Defence Ministers SM Krishna and AK Antony of the Agreement for Defence Cooperation between India and Singapore is a significant milestone for both countries. It was 11 years in the making, the signing was long awaited, and the agreement itself is far from comprehensive, but it opens the way for greater defence exchanges and cooperation between the two countries, particularly in areas of training.
It also marks a new era in Indian-Singapore defence ties. The two defence chiefs are to meet in Singapore in September for the first time, to sign a Defence Framework Agreement, which is expected to be followed by a visit to New Delhi by the Indian defence minister. In other words, a more formal structure for defence relations between New Delh and",487,187,0.5133689839572193,7.020215271620454,0.8725393651283679,0.056104542898107304,0.8685714285714285,0.8539877300613498,0.766706524469417,55.93895544403448,56.55080213903744,52.477475966912586

The Defence Planning Committee (the committee set up by the Prime Minister's Office for strategic planning of India' defense) recently held its first meeting for 3-4 February 08 in New Delhi. As a first step of the meeting, the committee decided to conduct a comprehensive review of all aspects of defence and security of ""the country and … to evolve a long-term vision to ensure that our defence forces meet the challenges of an increasingly sophisticated security situation"".
In view of this review, a number of important developments have been made in the security scenario and the Indian security establishment is taking a hard look at the changing security matrix in a global context. In the recent past, India had taken a few key initiatives in order to build a strong defence capability. The decision to acquire 126 MIG aircraft from Russia is in many ways an extension of these initiatives.
