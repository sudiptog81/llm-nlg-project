India’s Defence Budget: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly
By: Dr. Ajai Shukla
The Union Budgets are the most anticipated documents in the Indian calendar. They are eagerly awaited, debated and dissected. In the first of a two-part series, Aerospace and Defense Focus analyses the defence budget and its impact on the industry.
As India’ s defence spending has grown from Rs. 1,00,592 crore (US$ 21.2 billion) in 06-07 to R15,48,129 cr.

India and Russia have been partners in defence for more than five decades now. However, the relationship has not always been smooth. The recent announcement of the joint production of BrahMos cruise missiles in India is a welcome development. This will not only improve the capability of both countries but also provide an opportunity to India to improve its technology and manufacturing capabilities.
The relationship between India and the Soviet Union began in 1947, when the Indian government signed a trade agreement with the USSR. In 2008, India became the world's largest arms importer, spending $4.1 billion on defence equipment. India'

Bhattacharya, Somdutta
This paper examines the relationship between defence expenditure and growth for India. It does so by applying the methodology of the ‘new’ defence economics, which is based on the premise that defence is a cost rather than a benefit to the economy. The paper estimates the defence multiplier for a panel of 25 Indian states for the period 1990-2011. We find that the impact of defence on growth is positive, but that it is statistically insignificant. However, the estimated defence effect is sensitive to both the specification of our model and the choice of states. This suggests that there is scope for further research on defence and its impact on economic development in India, using a broader range of models and data.

The role and importance of the armed forces is not limited to the military domain, but also extends to areas such as disability rehabilitation, relief and rescue, medical aid, and civil-military cooperation. This is due to their unique skill sets, infrastructure, equipment, manpower, logistics, training, experience, discipline, morale, leadership, esprit de corps, etc. The armed services have been a part of India’s disastrous response for decades.

India's Defence Industry
The Indian defence market is expected to be worth $100 billion in the next decade, with an annual growth rate of 7-8 per cent.
In the past, the defence sector was considered a ""closed shop"", with the government controlling all aspects of it. However, in recent years, there has been a gradual opening up of the sector, and it is now possible for private companies to enter the market. This has led to a number of new players entering the field, including some of India' s largest companies. In addition, foreign companies are also increasingly active in India, particularly in areas such as aviation and shipbuilding. As a result, India is becoming an increasing important player in global defence markets.",14,187,0.5751633986928104,7.114378334399101,0.8900491139027654,0.05032787905250607,0.8666666666666667,0.866666666666667,0.7772139438618881,51.54904306220096,51.57516339869281,50.65948012232416

The Indian defence industry has seen significant changes in the last two decades. The liberalisation of the economy and the opening up of new avenues for private players in defence sector have resulted in a new scenario. There is a need for better understanding of supply chains and their relationship with customers. This paper provides an analysis of how a defence PSU has adopted the concept of SCOR and how it has helped in managing customer relationships.

In his blog, the writer argues that the Indian defence establishment has been systematically underfunded for years. He also arguably suggests that a part of the budget should be used to create a ‘peace dividend’.
The Indian military has always been under-resourced and undervalued. It is not just the army, but also the navy and the air force. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has not been able to replace its ageing fleet of MiG 21s and Mirages, while the Navy has had to operate with an age-old fleet, which includes 1960s vintage destroyers and frigates. And the Army, well, it is a story of its own. So, there is an urgent need to increase the defence expenditure. However, this does not mean that we should increase it blind",17,200,0.5823529411764706,7.592953389588967,0.8947235578765801,0.04719966510524967,0.86,0.8767123287671232,0.8013851673719515,62.11424762346395,69.65882352941176,63.16948282300224

However, India’ s defence manufacturing industry has been slow to develop, and the country’ S defence procurement policies have been criticised as being too restrictive and too focused on Western suppliers.
The Indian government has recently announced a number of initiatives to promote the development of India S micro and small enterprise (MSME) sector, which is a key component of its Make in India programme. These initiative include the establishment of a National Defence Manufacturing Policy, the creation of an MSME Development Fund, a scheme to provide financing to MSMs for defence projects, an increase in procured from MSMS, as well as a range of other measures.

The paper then examined some implications for the future of bilateral defense co-operation and concludes with some recommendations for further enhancing cooperative ties.
Singapores defense policy is based on a three-pronged strategy of deterrence, diplomacy and defense. In the event of a threat to its territorial integrity, Singapore would duly respond, but would also seek to resolve the problem through diplomatic means.

The US-Indian defence relationship has grown rapidly over the last decade. In 2005, the US and India signed the New Framework for the Defence Relationship, which provided the basis for a comprehensive bilateral dialogue on defence issues.

11.1 Introduction: a new look at the frontiers of empire
In the late 1870s, the British government began to question the value of its control over the North-West Frontier of India. The region was remote, and its inhabitants, many of them, at least, hostile to British rule. It was difficult to defend, because of both the terrain and because the local tribesmen were able to move quickly and with great mobility. In addition, it was also a place where the costs of maintaining an army were high, while the benefits were uncertain. And, finally, its strategic importance was limited.
Nevertheless, for more than a century the Frontiers had been the responsibility of Britain. They had to be defended, or so it seemed. There were two reasons for this. First, British India was the 'jewel in the crown' of a",28,190,0.5445026178010471,7.525175895041185,0.8842629696962797,0.050738858959949125,0.8342857142857143,0.8304191616766468,0.7482600030206286,49.979905046834176,47.68586387434555,46.267834793491865

Indian Air Force: A Force That Does Not Exist

IAF’s woes are not a secret. They are well known and have been well documented in the media. The lack of fighter squadrons, the shortage of spares, a large number of aircraft undergoing major repairs and the inability to replace them, are just some of the problems that the IAF is facing.
The IA is a force that does not exist. It has been decimated by the Pakistan Army and is now in a state of virtual collapse. Despite this, there are no plans to rebuild it. Instead, it is being disbanded and replaced by a new army that will be made up of volunteers. This new force will have no military experience and will not be able to fight against Pakistan.",32,190,0.524390243902439,6.715471761210061,0.8734243061644078,0.05714881161810298,0.84,0.8325714285714285,0.764018682539349,50.59435836313071,56.61585365853659,45.68269230769231

India and the United States have been trying to find a common ground in their defence relationship for some time now. The two countries have shared interests in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and have a convergent view on the need to counter China’s growing influence in South Asia. However, the US has been unable to overcome the ‘hangover’ of the Cold War, and its strategic vision for the region remains wedded to the notion of containing China.
The US is also concerned about India’S growing defence ties with Russia, which has emerged as a key partner for New Delhi. India has also been cautious about the security implications of its growing tilt towards the West. This has led to a situation where the two sides are unable either to move forward or to backtrack.

Amidst the controversy over the Rafale deal, the defence budget for 19-24 has been announced. The allocation for capital outlay is Rs 4.05 lakh crore, which is a 6.8% increase over last year’s allocation.
The Defence Ministry has also decided to introduce a new category of capital acquisitions, “Buy (Indian-IDDM)”. This will allow the procurement of defence equipment from the private sector. It is expected that this will provide an impetus to the ‘Make in India’ initiative and help in boosting the economy. However, this is not the first time that such a category has come into existence. In 80s, a similar category called “Make” was introduced. But, it did not yield the desired results. So, what will be different this time?

In the last 10 years, India has made a remarkable transition from a net importer to a major exporter of defence equipment. This has been achieved by the indigenisation of many products, including radars, airborne warning and control systems, missiles, artillery guns, armoured vehicles, naval ships and submarines. It is also the only country in the world to have built a fully indigeneous aircraft carrier. The government has now set a target of 60 per cent indigeous content in all defence acquisitions by 2025. With a large number of projects in various stages of execution, this target appears achievable. In the process, the country has also emerged as a hub for the global aerospace and defence industry.

India is the only country in the world to have been created as a result of an idea. It is also the largest democracy in human history. Yet, the very idea that India is a country has come under attack in recent years, especially from within the country.
The Envisionment of A Nation is an attempt to explain why this is so. What is it about the concept of India that has led to its rejection by so many people? The book takes a long historical perspective to answer this question, and traces the origins of this idea to the eighteenth century. The author argues that the Indian idea has been a source of inspiration for many thinkers, including the founding fathers of modern India, who drew on the ideas of Enlightenment philosophers like Montesquieu and Rousseau to construct a new nation.

Criminal law is an integral part of our legal system. It is the most important area of law, because it is concerned with the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are guaranteed by the Constitution of India. The criminal code is a body of rules and regulations that set out the guidelines for the conduct of the criminal process. These rules are meant to ensure that the accused person is treated fairly and that justice is done. However, the rules of evidence and procedure are often complex and difficult to understand, and it can be difficult for an accused to defend himself against the charges brought against him. This is where the role of a criminal lawyer comes in. A criminal attorney is someone who is trained in law to represent people accused of crimes. They are responsible for preparing the case and presenting it in court.

During the Russians– Japanese war, the Indian government was in a dilemma. It was not sure how to respond to the war. The British government did not want to take any side. But the government of the United States of America was eager to help the Japanese. In 1904, Lord Curzon, Viceroy of British India, sent a telegram to Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State for India. Curson said that the British Empire was facing a grave danger. He said, “The British people are ready to give all the support to Russia in this war.”
But Lord Curron was anxious. “If the people of Russia lose the confidence of their government, they may turn against us. We cannot afford to lose their confidence.” He wanted to know how the Viceregal Government of Bengal would",51,193,0.5056179775280899,6.745785200962753,0.868390126036164,0.05848236054994469,0.7885714285714285,0.8116883116883115,0.7462862994770016,40.78257761437908,41.42134831460674,38.06477702191988

India's defence expenditure is the fourth largest in the world and has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 12.7 per cent over the last decade. The defence budget for 2015-16 was Rs. 3,00,290 crore, which is 5.8 per of the total expenses of government. It is a fact that the defence sector is one of those sectors which are most affected by the fluctuations in economic conditions. During the period of recession, the government of India has increased the allocation for defence in order to boost the economy and employment opportunities.

for the use of the analytics techniques in the field of defence.
This report has been prepared as a result of a request by the
Government of India to the Council of Scientific and Industrial
Research to examine the possibilities of applying the techniques and
methods of operative research to defence problems. It is not intended
that this work should be exhaustive, but rather that it should
indicate the nature of problems which could be dealt with and the type
and range of techniques which are applicable. The report should also
show how the methods of analysis and problem solving have been
applied to problems in defence and how they have influenced

India has made some progress in the defence manufacturing sector, but it still has a long way to go.
The Indian defence sector is one of the most important sectors of our economy. It contributes to around 2.5% of India’s GDP and is a major employer. However, the sector has been plagued by corruption and inefficiency. In order to turn things around, India needs to make some major changes. First, it needs a new defence strategy. Second, we need to reform our defence procurement process. Third, our military needs more money and better equipment. Finally, there needs be more transparency in defence deals. If India can make these changes, then it can turn its defence into a world-class force.",65,191,0.5359477124183006,6.6293070843264355,0.8760110583065229,0.05675352589590897,0.86,0.8533333333333339,0.7711611352977069,54.90088102889749,54.470588235294116,47.555566801619435

India has a very diverse defence industry. This diversity is reflected in a variety of defence products, a wide range of manufacturing capabilities and a rich pool of skilled manpower. The Indian defence production industry is largely dominated by the public sector.
The defence industrial base is characterized by a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises. There are about 200 private companies and more than 10,050 small-scale industries involved in defence manufacture. These industrie

Majority of the countries are now focussing on healthcare and medical infrastructure. Defence sector has been left out in the cold. In India, the pandemonium has forced the Defense Ministry to postpone the procurement of arms and ammunition. India has also postponed the MMRCA tender. These decisions have a serious impact on the country’s defence preparedness. There is a need to increase the budget allocation for defence.

The North-West Frontier, the borderland between British India and Afghanistan, was a theatre of war for most of the nineteenth century. It was also a region of great strategic importance, both in terms of Britain's imperial interests and as a buffer zone against Russian expansionism. In the 1890s, however, British policy in the region was severely criticized in Parliament and in public opinion. The situation was exacerbated by the Boer War, which caused a major political crisis in India. After the war, a number of reforms were introduced to deal with the situation, including the creation of a new political structure for the Northwest Frontiers, and a more flexible system of defence.

India and France have been in talks for a long time over the possibility of a joint venture to build a 126 multirole fighter aircraft. Now, the two sides have come to an agreement that could see the French Rafale jet fighters produced in India.
The French government has said that it is willing to partner with India on the Rafales. However, there are still some hurdles to overcome before this deal can be finalized. The two governments must agree on how much each side will contribute to the project and how long it will take for the planes to be delivered. They also need to decide where they will be built and what kind of technology they’ll use. If all goes well, we could have our first Rafael jet in service by 2025!

Terrorism is a worldwide phenomenon, which is not confined to any particular region or country. It is an organized activity to cause violence, fear and insecurity to a particular group of people, with a motive to gain political power. Terrorists use weapons and explosives to achieve their objectives. India has been facing terrorism for decades. The terrorist attacks have been increasing in recent years.

This arrangement was in accordance with the spirit of a 1950 law, the ""Army Act"", which stated that the chief was to be a soldier of proven integrity and a person of outstanding ability and capacity. In the past, this had been interpreted to mean that a chief had to have at least 25 years of service in a field unit. But this was no longer the case.

There is also a strong emphasis on innovation and R&D. This has resulted in a new set of challenges for the defence services and defence industries. In order to meet these challengers, there needs to be a change in how innovations are created and implemented.

One of these initiatives is the “Make-in-Indian” (MII) programme, which aims to promote the development of a robust domestic industry capable of meeting the country’s defence requirements.
In this context, it is important to examine the role of India-Kenya defence relations in the context of MII.

The joint forces of India are evolving in a way that it is becoming more and more difficult to distinguish between the three services. The jointmanship is being practiced at the operational level, and in the training and education of the officers. It is not that the joint training has been done away with.
Jointmanships are not only being done at operative level but also at strategic level. This has given birth to the concept of ‘jointness’. ‘JOINTNESS’ is a concept that has emerged in recent years in Indian defence. Jointness has come to be accepted as a basic requirement for any modern military. As joint operations have become an integral part of modern warfare, the need for joint services has also increased. There is no doubt that joint operation is more efficient and effective than separate operations. But there is also a need to develop",87,200,0.4782608695652174,6.487446070815474,0.858560301139939,0.06245080616334651,0.8057142857142857,0.8082500000000004,0.7631641612781292,36.8,42.10326086956522,37.17236467236467

The Indian Ocean is a unique marine environment, with its rich biodiversity and the importance of its ecosystems for the well-being of the region’s populations. Its coasts, including those of Western Indian countries, are threatened by climate change and sea level rise. In order to protect these vulnerable areas, a new project has been launched to explore the potential of green infrastructure to reduce flooding and coastline erosion.
Green coast protection is an innovative approach that uses natural systems to provide protection from coast eroding processes and climate-related hazards. The project will involve the development of an evidence base for green protection measures, the implementation of pilot projects and capacity building in the countries concerned.

R.W.J.L. Buisman
The Frontier Tribal Areas (FTA) of British India are not well known to historians. This is not surprising, since the FTA was a borderland, a front line of defence, and a military zone. The FTAs were a buffer zone between the British Raj and the Muslim Sultanates in Afghanistan and Central Asia. In the late nineteenth century, the region was threatened by the rise of the Russian Empire and by annexationist tendencies of local rulers. To defend the border, it was decided to create a special administrative zone with a unique system of government. As a result, there were two parallel administrations, one British and one tribally, that co-existed for decades. A peculiarity of this zone was the presence of a large number of military canton",90,192,0.5739644970414202,7.461538461538462,0.8917741329269079,0.04857781450419806,0.8266666666666667,0.8256551724137922,0.7628081146825304,46.77993162864852,50.52662721893491,42.765507518796994

Australia has long been concerned about the Soviet Union's naval activities in Asia and the Indian ocean. In the last two years, however, the Australian government has taken a more pro-active approach towards the Soviets, and has initiated a series of steps to improve the effectiveness of Australia' s defence capabilities.

India is a major defence importer, with purchasing requirements running into billions of dollars every year. The US is the largest exporter of defence equipment to India, accounting for more than half of all defence imports in 2006-07. In the wake of the recent scandal involving counter-feits in spare parts for the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, the US Department of Defence has tightened the procurement rules. These changes have implied that the Defense Security Service (DSS) will have to be involved in all purchasers of US defence articles and services. This would mean that even India' s Defences Procurements, which are currently under the Ministry of External Affairs, would have the DSS involved.

The proposed Indian model Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 18th July 30, 65, has been widely criticized for not going far enough in terms of protecting user’s rights and ensuring that they are not deprived of their right to privacy.
In this article, we will analyse the provisions of the Bill and argue that the Indian government has failed to protect the privacies of its citizens. The Bill is likely to be passed in its current form, and the government is unlikely to make any significant changes to the proposed legislation. This article will argue for the need to improve the current legislative framework in order to ensure that user privacies are protected. We will also argue against the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, as this could lead to a violation of user rights.

Coastal Erosion is one of the most important environmental problems faced by India. This is due to the high population density, industrialization and urbanization along the coast. The Southwest Coast of India is most vulnerable to eroding. A detailed study has been made on the eroded coasts in Southwestern India, which includes the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Coastal defence structures are being constructed to protect the shoreline from erodible forces. In this study, the effectiveness of these structures has also been studied.

It has also been recognized as a part and parcel of right against self-incrimination. The right is implicit in the freedoms of speech, expression, assembly and movement.
The right not to have one’s privateness interfered with is recognized in many other countries. In the United States of America, the Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment of U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.

Abstract: Arsenical compound is a major toxic element which is commonly found in the soils of Punjab, India. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediated induction of arsine (AsH3) detrimental effect on the plant growth and development is well documented. However, the role of sulfur compounded in arsinic stress tolerance of plants is not well understood. To understand the effect of AsH<sub>3</sub>, the plants were exposed to As at 50 mg/kg soil and 100 µg As/g soil for 4 weeks. Arsic induced",106,191,0.6571428571428571,7.7754191435023525,0.9150375908140737,0.03958869544289598,0.8879999999999999,0.8675862068965521,0.8321040316543228,78.46433063056615,72.32142857142857,50.528614457831324

India and Russia have a long history of defence and military cooperation, but there are signs that the relationship is under strain.
In recent months, Russia has raised the price of its weapons, making them unaffordable for India. India is also concerned about the quality of Russian weapons and the lack of transparency in the procurement process. In addition, India has been looking to diversify its defence suppliers and has signed contracts with other countries, including the United States. Russia is the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for more than 70% of the country’s defence budget. However, the recent developments have put the future of this relationship in doubt. It is time for both countries to sit down and discuss the way forward. If they can find common ground, there is no reason why the defence relationship between India and Russian should not continue to be strong.",107,188,0.5359116022099447,7.209953218597514,0.8800064616732979,0.05314907961761336,0.9028571428571429,0.8963057324840764,0.7725329744352385,65.35354671143278,62.41436464088398,54.735767729342875

Australia is one of the fastest growing defence markets in the world, with a defence budget of AUD 39 billion. The defence industry in Australia is a significant contributor to the country’s economy, accounting for around 1.5 per cent of GDP and employing more than 60,00 people.
The Australian defence market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7 per between 01/07/2022 and 70/12/30. This growth is driven by several factors, including an increase in defence spending, the need to modernise and upgrade existing equipment, and the growing geopolitical threats faced by the region. As a result, there is an increasing demand for defence equipment and services in India.

India and the United States are forging closer defence ties, in particular through a landmark 2005 agreement that will see US firms supply India with a range of weapons. This paper examines the strategies behind the relationship and assesses the potential for closer co-operation in the future.
The Indian and US defence establishments have been cooperating for some time. In 1998, the two countries signed an agreement to co–operate in defence research and development. Since then, both countries have collaborated on several projects, including the development of the Javelin anti–tank missile. India has also been a major buyer of US arms, with its armed forces having acquired some 50 percent of their weapons from the US.

Offsets are defined as the obligation on foreign vendors to invest a portion of the contract value in various activities in Indian industry. This includes purchases from Indian venders, research and development, technology transfers and investments. These off-set obligations are typically 30-50% of contract values. Offsets can be in cash or in kind. There are no restrictions on the choice of off set activities, except that they should be related to the defence industry or defence research. Investment in civilian industry is also permitted. It is the responsibility of foreign firms to determine the off sets and to report on their implementation.

South Asia is a region of high strategic importance to the United States, and the security of this region is of great concern to both the US and Indian governments. The development of India’s missiles, including its nuclear-capable ballistic missilities, has implicated the nuclear strategies of both India and Pakistan. This paper examines the evolution of Indian missilery and its implication for the strategists in both countries. It argues that the development and deployment of the Prithvi and Agni missils have made India a nuclear power and a de facto nuclear weapons state. These missels have also made the Indian nuclear strategy more robust, thereby reducing the probability of a crisis or conflict.

Defence is one of the most important functions of government. The defence of a country is a very serious and responsible task. It is the first responsibility of any government to protect its people from any external aggression. Defence of our country has been the primary responsibility and function of armed forces for centuries.
The security of India has always been of paramount importance to its political leadership. In the last few decades, the security environment in our region has undergone significant changes. India is surrounded by hostile neighbours and a host of non-state actors. China and Pakistan are the two main adversaries of Indian security. Both these countries are engaged in an arms race to enhance their military capabilities. Pakistan has made significant progress in developing nuclear weapons. This has resulted in a strategic imbalance in the region.

An analysis on foreign investments in the indian defence industry
Foreign investors have been allowed to invest in defence production in India since 2001, and the Government has taken several steps to encourage foreign participation in this sector. In fact, the defence ministry has even been promoting joint ventures between foreign and Indian companies in order to improve the technology and efficiency of Indian defence industries.
However, foreign companies have not been able to make a significant impact in Indian markets, with many of them withdrawing from their joint-ventures with Indian firms. This article looks at why this is happening and what needs to be done to change the situation. The article also discusses how foreign fir...

Indian Defence Industry-Regulations & Rewards
The Indian defence sector is growing at a steady pace, and it is one of the most important sectors in the country. The defence budget of India is around 2.5 lakh crore rupees, which is about 1.7% of its GDP. This is a significant increase from the previous year’s budget, when it was around Rs 3 lacs.
In order to promote the growth of this sector, the government has introduced several regulations. These regulate the manufacturing and export of defence equipment, as well as the use of technology and research. In addition, there are several reforms in place that are aimed at making the sector more efficient and effective. Here are some of these reactions and their impact on the industry:

The British Empire in the twentieth century is often seen as a series of setbacks, retreats and humiliations. This book argues that the British were in fact able to hold on to their empire by exploiting the very weaknesses that were attributed to them by their critics. It examines the case of the Transcaspian frontier in Central Asia, where the collapse of Russian authority in 2015 created a power vacuum.
This book examined the response of Britain and India to the Russian collapse and arguing that Britain was able in effect to re-establish a frontiers in a part of Central Asian that had been out of its control for nearly a century. The book also arguably established that it was the imperial authorities in London who were responsible for the failure of a much more ambitious policy in Iran.",148,194,0.5730994152046783,7.494247306438351,0.8917284120762755,0.04848713682027419,0.8733333333333332,0.8726530612244898,0.7883644518805037,62.87859007832898,66.17543859649123,55.07

The Defence Production Policy 2011 has been drafted in a way that makes it easy for the Indian private industry to enter the defence sector.
Air Vice Marshal (Retd) V R Chaudhary
India's defence requirements are growing and the need for a strong defence industrial base is becoming increasingly imperative. In this context, the Defense Production Act 1980 and its subsequent amendments have been in force for several years. The policy has remained unchanged over the years and has not kept pace with the rapidly changing global scenario. Therefore, a review of this policy is overdue. As a first step, it is necessary to define the scope of policy and clearly identify the objectives. Defining the policy scope and objecting the objective is the first and most important step in the process of making policy. However, this is not a static process.",149,188,0.5406976744186046,7.091183520466117,0.8805447997215052,0.053434882675610584,0.8533333333333334,0.8575675675675682,0.7734350621940576,51.33612273361227,57.66860465116279,56.7672469374597

S. K. Jain, A. B. Srivastava
The quality of defence R&D output is a matter of concern and a major area of interest for the defence establishment. This paper presents a study of quality systems in defence research and development organisational units and their performance. The study is based on the data collected from a sample of 16 units of the DRDO. It was found that the units have been using quality assurance (QA) systems for a long time but their systems are not fully implemented. A majority of them are following the ISO 9001:205 standard. There is an overall improvement in the performance of these units in terms of their QA systems. However, the study reveals that there is still scope for further improvement.

In Defense of Fragmentation
Writing about the Hindus and Muslims in contemporary India is a difficult task. There are many reasons for this. One of them is the nature of our society. It is not a homogenous society, as is often assumed. In fact, it is one of great diversity. We are a country of many faiths, languages, cultures, and traditions. This is what makes us a vibrant and alive society but also makes it difficult to speak of us in the singular. Our society is divided not only along religious lines",153,193,0.5246913580246914,6.678230711206282,0.8732318689917037,0.057373735943829864,0.8266666666666667,0.8130434782608703,0.7536863728617256,42.96996577057939,44.77160493827161,39.77207817846802

India’s ballistic missiles are an important part of its national security apparatus. The country has a number of missions in its military doctrine, which include the deterrence of a nuclear attack by its adversaries, the destruction of enemy strategic and tactical assets, and the projection of power. To achieve these missons, India has an array of ballistics missles, including short-range, medium-ranged, intermediate- and intercontinental- range ballastic missle systems.
However, while India’ s ballistc missels have been deployed, they are not fully operational. For example, its Prithvi-II (P-2) short range surface-to-surface misslie (SRBM), which has been in service since 1995, is yet to be fully integrated into the Indian military. This is because it is still undergoing flight tests and its production line is not yet fully functional",154,199,0.5789473684210527,7.570719217728538,0.8937029425667388,0.047602885172331806,0.8533333333333334,0.839183673469388,0.8039083172796793,62.56967213114755,59.590643274853804,50.03134218289085
Indian defense,the defence of india: a budgetary perspective of strategy and politics,"the defence of india: a budgetary perspective of strategy and politics
Paper presented at the Indian Society of International Law conference on 19th September 2015
Defence expenditure in India has been a subject of considerable debate. It is a highly sensitive subject and is often viewed as a source of wasteful expense. The subject has attracted much attention in recent years, particularly in the aftermath of the 4th Finance Commission report on defence expenses. This paper attempts to examine the budgeting process of defence, its impact on the economy and the political and strategic imperatives that have influenced the process.
It is important to note that defence budget is an important component of government expediture and a large part of it is devoted to capital expensiture. In addition to the capital outlays, the current expendiure incurred in defence is also quite large.

The role Ballistic Missile Defence in Emerging India-China Strategic Balance
Satish K. Chandra
Ballistic-missile-defence (BMD) is a strategically important component of the Indo-US strategi
c partnership. The US has been eager to sell BMD technology to India. This paper examines the
IndoChinese strategies, their implications for BM D and the prospects for India’s acquisition of B
M technology from the US. It argues that India is unlikely to acquire B M technology in its present
form. However, India could acqui re B MD technology for a limited purpose. India and China are
likely to develop their own BD systems, but they will not be interoperable. Their B D systems will
have different missions and will be designed to protect different assets. They will also have different",170,195,0.5497076023391813,7.188359661277602,0.8836235067391955,0.0521167469657467,0.8533333333333334,0.8634013605442177,0.7965008247264218,54.216796875,52.52046783625731,54.28667376317924

The Middle East has been a major source of strategic and commercial interest for Britain for over 200 years. In the 50-year period covered by this book, Britain's relationship with the Ottoman Empire was the dominant influence on her foreign policy.
From the French Revolution to the Napoleonic Wars, and from the Congress of Vienna to Trafalgar, the Middle Eastern territories were the theatre for a series of conflicts which determined Britain’s place in world politics. This book describes the development of British interests in Syria, Egypt, Persia, Arabia and Turkey, as well as the early stages of the East India Company’ and the British Navy’’ s involvement in these regions. It also examines the key role played by the Arabian Peninsula, where Britain fought a long and bloody war against the Persian Empire.

India’s Partition and Defence of Pakistan: An Historical Perspective
The Partitions of India and Pakistan are among the most traumatic events in the subcontinent’ s history. They were the result of the British Government’’ decision to grant independence to India on 15th August 47. The decision was taken after a series of events that began with the arrival of Lord Mountbatten in India in March 2046. These events, which were to change the destiny of millions of people, were neither inevitable nor unavoidable. On the contrary, they were a result, among other things, of a flawed British policy of ‘’divide and rule’. This policy had been followed for more than a century and had led to a situation where the Muslims were alienated and marginalized in a predominantly Hindu India.
It is therefore, imperative to understand",172,197,0.5588235294117647,7.286167394050018,0.8866930716650269,0.050800055203665796,0.8266666666666667,0.8249315068493157,0.7731381376625712,50.16819571865443,49.10588235294118,45.355979581915406

In the first volume of his critically acclaimed history of British imperialism, N A M Rodgers examined the establishment of Britain's global maritime empire. The second volume traced its expansion across the globe from the end of Napoleonic Wars to the outbreak of World War I. In this third volume, Rodgger turns to imperial defense and its impact on the nature of imperial power. He examines the Royal navy' s role in protecting Britain and her empires from foreign attack, and in upholding British interests in world politics.

India’s defence ties with Israel have received a boost with the recent visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to India. This is the first time that an Israelli Prime Minster has visited India in the last 15 years. The visit is significant for several reasons. First, it is indicative of the deepening of bilateral tensions between India and Pakistan. Second, the visit comes at a time when India is engaged in a major arms race with China, which is a long-time ally of Pakistan and is increasingly becoming a rival.
The visit also coincides with a period of relative calm in India-Pakistan relations. In recent years, there have been several high-level visits between the two countries, including a visit by Prime minister Narendra Modi to Pakistan in 2014.

The European Union is India's second largest trading partner. The European Defence Agency (EDA) was set up in 2004 to contribute to the European security and defence policy. In 1998, the EU and India signed a Cooperation Agreement, which is the basis for bilateral relations.
In the field of defence, India is an important partner for the EDA. Both sides have expressed a common desire to develop their co-operation. But there are still many obstacles to be overcome. On the one hand, there is a lack of clarity about the scope of the cooperative activities and, on the other, about their financing. Moreover, neither the Indian nor the Union Defense Ministers have the political power to make decisions. To overcome these obstacle, both sides must find a new political impetus.",191,187,0.5696969696969697,7.317890075118315,0.8898047982481192,0.04969379915440369,0.8666666666666667,0.8451063829787235,0.7765345590462858,59.27713817871823,57.83030303030303,47.90361868045211

The Indian Defence sector is undergoing a major transformation. The new policy initiatives of the Government of India have resulted in an increased emphasis on indigenisation, a higher degree of self-reliance and the development of a robust domestic defence industry.
India is on the cusp of its next big defence acquisition programmes. As per the Ministry of Defense, India is looking at a potential acquisitions budget of USD 150 billion over the next decade, which will be the biggest in the world. This will provide an opportunity for Indian companies to partner with the global majors in order to develop the technologies required for the Indian defence requirements. A key focus area for this partnership will need to be in areas of technology transfer, manufacturing capabilities and joint ventures.

Professor Srinath Raghavan
Defence analysts in India and abroad are united in their assessment that India’s defence expenditure is inadequate to meet its security requirements. The reasons for this include the fact that defence spending has been declining as a proportion of the GDP, the inability of successive governments to build a consensus on the nature of India's security challenges, and the failure to make defence procurement more efficient. This talk will examine these issues, arguing that the current problems are rooted in the country' s past. It will be argued that a key reason why India has not been able to achieve a more robust defence posture is that it has pursued a strategy of ‘strategic autonomy’, which has had the effect of reducing the level of",196,200,0.5859872611464968,7.3423993371021234,0.8942976174667105,0.048136253593062873,0.8733333333333334,0.8649624060150377,0.7940472884121491,48.653721293537586,60.853503184713375,61.81007339644719

In 2007, India and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) signed a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which was a major step in deepening relations between India, Asean and other Asiatic countries.
The two countries have been working together on a number of issues, including security, trade, and investment. The two sides have also been cooperating on projects such as the India-Vietnam oil pipeline and the Delhi-Hanoi railway line. Recently, the two nations have signed an agreement on defence cooperation.

India's defence education system has been in a state of flux since independence. In the first years after independence, the Indian military was not adequately staffed, and the British officers who had been trained at Sandhurst and at the Royal Military College in India were needed to fill the ranks of the army. But by the 1960s, India was producing more than enough officers to staff its armed forces, yet the system of education that produced them was inefficient, ineffective, unimaginative, lacking in innovation, unable to attract the best and brightest, out of touch with the needs of a modern military, unaware of developments in military education around the world,...

The JSC was the most important of these three, as it was responsible for the strategic direction of defense. The COS were responsible to the MoD for operational matters.
In 30 years, there had been a significant change in the global strategies of defence. This led to a shift in priorities for HQ MoS, and in particular, to their role as the center for strategizing.

In order to promote the growth of MSMS in the defence sector, the government has taken several initiatives, such as the ""Make in India"" campaign, which aims to encourage foreign companies to manufacture their products in Indian MSSEs. Another initiative is the Defense Corridors, where MSSMs can set up their manufacturers and benefit from tax breaks and other incentives. These initiates have helped to increase the number of defence MSMDs in MSMMs, and the sector continues to grow.",212,191,0.6266666666666667,7.675067860720625,0.9067302877986564,0.042861121661698205,0.86,0.890476190476189,0.8118094055495101,71.48328412989707,69.66,58.12422037422037

J. S. Dewan
This book examines the role of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in the civil–mil­it­ary relationship in India. The author argues that the MoD is a weak min­istry and that its role in civil­milita­ry relations is not well defined. This has led to a lack of accountability and control over the defence forces, which have been allowed to become autonomous and powerful.
The author traces the development of civil military relations over a period of 60 years, beginning with the first defence secretary, Lt Gen P. C. Lal, in 1954, and concluding with a brief discussion of current issues. He describes how the structure of Mo­D has remained unchanged since 2001 and how it has failed to meet the needs of a modern defence minis­try.

The present study was aimed at evaluating the performance of three rice (Oryza sativa L.) landrace varieties of Jeypur tract in Odishan India in terms of leaf gas exchange, antagonistic and pro-oxidative enzymes, and the relationship between these trails in the context of multiple stresses. The results revealed that the three land races showed high tolerances to both drought and salinity stress. However, the tolerant land race showed higher antiprotease activity and lower prooxydative activity than the sensitive land race. Moreover, tolerants showed significantly higher chlorophyll content, higher photosystem II activity, lower non-structural carbohydrate and starch content and higher leaf water potential than sensitive. These results suggest that tolerable land raced showed better leaf functioning in photosythetic and stress-",220,183,0.575,7.273238618387272,0.8909623082220898,0.04946994384875627,0.8666666666666666,0.856176470588236,0.802111475980132,55.77780775110152,67.44375,51.109613375130614

India is one of the largest importers of defence equipment in the world. The country' s defence budget is growing steadily, and it has been estimated that India'S defence expenditure will rise to $110 billion by 2015. India is also one the major arms exporters in Asia. It is currently the third largest arms supplier in South Asia and the seventh largest in world, with a 3.4% share of global arms exports.
The defence industry in India has grown over the years, as the country is seeking to reduce its dependence on imports. Indian defence companies are now able to meet the majority of domestic requirements for defence products. However, the industry is still heavily reliant on imported technology, which is a major concern for the Indian government. As a result, India needs to develop its own defence capabilities in order to become self-sufficient.

The political dynamics of India' s Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) programme have been subjected to intense speculation and debate in the past few years. The programme, which has been in existence since the early 1980s, was officially announced in January 2003. Since then, there has emerged a plethora of reports in both the Indian and international media on the programme. There are also a number of studies and articles on BMD published in academic journals. Most of these studies are either purely technical in nature or focus on one aspect of the BDM programme without providing a comprehensive picture of its political and strategic implication. This study, therefore, attempts to fill this gap in knowledge by examining the political factors that have influenced the development of BM D in India. In particular, the study will examine the following issues: (1) The role of national security",224,197,0.5911602209944752,7.95324736484468,0.8988807354044175,0.044789043808612865,0.88,0.8777070063694264,0.8006811926610441,67.99497710879089,64.93922651933701,54.247150997150996

The defence budget of India has always been a subject of debate. The question is whether it is sufficient to meet the requirements of the armed forces. It has been argued that the defence allocation is inadequate to maintain the operational efficiency of our defence forces, to modernise our weapon systems and to provide for the welfare of defence personnel. This article attempts to examine the trends in the allocation for defence during the post-independence period.
Defence expenses are met from the Defense budget. Deficiency in this budget is met by the revenue budget (the budget in which the expense for all the non-defence activities are made).

India’s new nuclear doctrine: Implications for Pakistan
The new Indian nuclear posture has been described as a ‘strategic triad’, which includes nuclear-armed submarines, land-based missiles and air-launched missile.
By Nadeem F. Paracha
Amidst the political furore over the Indian government’ s decision to withdraw the country’’ status as the world’ second largest arms importer, New Delhi has quietly launched its new ‘’Nuclear Doctrine’. The new doctrine has also been accompanied by a new set of nuclear delivery vehicles, including a nuclear submarine and a long-range nuclear missle. It is being argued that the new policy is a major departure from India’ previous nuclear policy, where the focus was on a minimum deterrent. Some have even gone as far as to call it a “first strike doctrine”.

Indian Defence and Security Industry
The Indian defence industry is a dynamic and rapidly growing sector that is playing an increasingly important role in the country’s economy and national security. The industry has been growing at a steady pace over the past few years, and is expected to continue to do so in future.
One of the key drivers of growth in this sector is the increasing demand for defence equipment from the Indian Armed Forces. With India’ s growing population and increasing security concerns, the need for modern and sophisticated defence systems has become a priority for the government. This has led to an increase in investment in research and development, as well as in procurement of defence goods and services. According to the Ministry of Defense, India spent over $55 billion on defence in 2019, which is more than double what it spent in just 10 years. Moreover, this figure is projected to increase to over",231,197,0.5454545454545454,7.458978726096732,0.884128614416961,0.05100328528611154,0.8571428571428571,0.8804907975460114,0.7878873984722461,62.333333333333336,64.92513368983957,64.17880464858882

India’s Defence Policy: The Challenges and Opportunities
The Indian armed forces are undergoing a major transformation. India’a defence expenditure has increased significantly in recent years. The country’ s defence budget has doubled over the past five years and is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace.
This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including India s increasingly assertive foreign policy, the country s growing economic power, and the growing threat from Pakistan and China. These factors are putting a strain on the Indian military, which is struggling to keep up with the demands of the government and its allies. As a result, India is facing a series of challenges that are threatening its ability to defend itself and maintain its position as a regional power. This paper will examine these challeng es and offer some possible solutions.",235,194,0.5952380952380952,7.715167498104595,0.8987514753225125,0.045498630464059824,0.8333333333333334,0.8741666666666669,0.8013906735453092,66.74471920540438,68.75,60.30715596330275

By: Bidyut Chakrabarty
The First World War, and the subsequent interwar years, were a period of intense debate over the future of the British Empire. In the years following the end of hostilities, the colonial governments of India and Australia began to agitate for greater autonomy and self-government. This book analyses the strategic and political implications of these debates for the defence of Britain and India. The book examines the political and strategical thinking of key figures in the post-war period, such as the Secretary of State for India, Sir Edwin Montagu, Lord Chelmsford, General Sir William Mitchell, Winston Churchill and Lord Halifax. It shows how the imperial debate had a profound impact on the formulation of British defence policy, particularly in relation to the Indian Army.

India’s defence ministry has launched a major overhaul of the country’ s defence acquisition system, with the aim of improving the way in which it purchases military hardware. The over-hauling of India’’ defence purchasing system comes at a time when the government is under pressure to reduce the costs of defence equipment and to speed up the delivery of orders.
In a move that has surprised many, the defence minister has announced that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) will no longer be the sole buyer of military equipment. Instead, it will act as the regulator of a new system that will see the Indian armed forces themselves take charge of purchas-ing military gear. Under the new proc-ess, each of three service chiefs will be responsible for the purchase of equipment for their respective services.

Indian Defence Offset Policy: An Impact Analysis
By: Lt Col. Gaurav Dua
Offsets are a mechanism to ensure that the benefits of defence acquisition are shared with the host country. In the Indian context, the Defense Offsets Policy was announced in 2005 and is aimed at achieving a fair and balanced distribution of the economic benefits derived from defence procurements.
The Definitive Approach
As per the policy, foreign vendors are required to invest a certain percentage of their total contract value in India, in projects that are related to the defence sector. The investments are to be made within a defined period of time, which varies from contract to contract. These projects are known as ‘offsets’. As per current policy guidelines, offsets can be in the form of:
Transfer of technology and/or know-how
Investments in research and development

These revised policies have opened up the Defense Sector to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) up to 74%. The policy has been welcomed by the foreign companies as an opportunity to invest in India. This has led to an influx of foreign investments in defense sector.

It also examined the causes and consequences of high defence budgets of both countries.

The recent deployment of the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) system has raised serious concerns about its impact on the regional strategies of India and Pakistan. This paper examines the implication of BMD for the strategical stability of South Asia. It is argued that BDM has the potential to destabilize the nuclear deterrence of Pakistan, and to lead to a nuclear arms race in South Asian region. The paper also suggests that the BMG will not be able to dampen the Pakistani nuclear capability. However, it will strengthen India's conventional military capabilites.

Japan is currently considering the deployment of a ballistics missiles defence (BMD) system, which has been a contentious issue in its relations with China. Japan’s BMD system is intended to protect against a limited ballistically missle attack from North Korea, but it is also likely to be seen as a threat by China, with whom Japan has a territorial dispute in the East China Sea. India is a close ally of Japan and has also been considering BDM. However, India’ s BM D programme is primarily designed to provide a shield against Pakistan, and China is not seen to pose a serious threat. This paper looks at the prospects for co-operation between India and Japan on B M D.

The Indian Rupees exchange rates have been volatile in recent times. The Indian ruppe has fallen to a record low of 69.19 to the dollar. This has been attributed to weak domestic economic fundamentals, such as high inflation, low growth, and high interest rates. In this blog post, we will explore the factors that have led to this volatility and how the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has responded to it.
India’s economy is heavily reliant on exports, with the country’ss top export destinations being the United States, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and the UAE. As a result of this, Indian exporters have experienced significant losses in the past few years due to currency fluctuations.

Indian Defense and United Nations Peace Keeping Operations: Are the Two Compatible?  United Nation’s (UN) peace keeping operations have been a major success story of the organization. 245,00 military and civilian personnel are deployed to 75 peace-keepings operations. These operations are often called ‘the UN’ s best idea’. The UN peace operations in the past have seen some successes, but also failures. A recent report by the UN highlighted that in some cases, peace keepers have contributed to the conflict and in others, they have failed to protect the civilians.

India’s Higher Defence Organisation: Implications For National Security And Jointness - 2019
The Government of India is in the process of creating a High-Level Defense Council (HDC) to advise the Prime Minister on defence and national-security related issues. The HDC is intended to be a single-point decision-making authority on all defense-related matters. This is a significant step toward India’ s goal of achieving joint-ness in national defense, which is widely considered to enhance the effectiveness of defense policy and operations. However, the establishment of the HLC could also have the unintended effect of undermining joint operations and even the concept of joint defence.
In this report, we examine the implication of this development for the future of Indian defence policy, and for India-U.S. defence cooperation. We recommend that",277,186,0.543859649122807,7.111887749987415,0.8815433844209584,0.05304828567669944,0.8533333333333334,0.8495238095238099,0.784277804612509,57.0,52.11695906432749,51.715891572456314

In the first of this two-part series, we examine the challenges to India’s defence sector and how the Modi government is tackling them.
India is not a country with a history of strategic thinking. Its leaders, from Jawaharlal Nehru to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have always been more comfortable with the idea of non-alignment than with that of alliances. India has been a reluctant buyer of weapons, preferring to develop its own arms industry and relying on the Soviet Union and later Russia to supply it. But the country has also been an indifferent provider of military hardware to other countries. And it has failed to build a coherent strategically oriented defence industrial base. Instead, India is a nation of arms importers and arms exporters, with neither the industry",279,183,0.5921052631578947,7.299963950884314,0.8956840537227323,0.047810918644049086,0.8866666666666667,0.8978124999999997,0.7936634669168666,64.3718378543127,66.15131578947368,65.40323464912281

The defence ministry has issued a draft notification on the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy in the defence manufacturing sector. The notification has sought comments from the public and stakeholders. It is expected that the FDI policy will be finalised by the end of this year.
India has one of the largest defence forces in terms of manpower. However, it is not equipped with modern weapons and equipment. This has led to a shortfall in defence expenditure, which has been a cause of concern for the government. In order to address this issue, the Indian government has decided to allow foreign direct investment in India's defence industry.

The 1987-88 Indian nuclear tests and the subsequent imposition of sanctions by the United States and other major Western countries in 2008-09 have severely constrained India’s access to advanced weapon systems and defence-related technologies. The Indian military’’ response to the sanctioned environment has been to diversify its defence suppliers. India has long been a major arms importer and, in recent years, has turned to Israel to meet its military requirements.
In 50 years of diplomatic relations, India and Israel have built a strong relationship, but the defence relationship has only begun to develop over the past decade. In 30-plus years as an independent nation, Israel has become a leading arms exporter, with a 70 per cent share of its $5.7 billion defence export market going to Asia. Israel’ s military and intelligence ties with India are significant and have",296,198,0.5891891891891892,8.013839380822503,0.8986643898280164,0.04469692741068358,0.9314285714285715,0.9006211180124224,0.8162242005953326,74.39650549989275,80.82162162162162,58.60381895332391

Innovation in the defence and security sector is a key priority for the European Union. The European Defence Action Plan (2013) highlights the importance of innovative technologies and the need for a better cooperation between Member States in this field. However, the EU is not the only region in which defence innovations are considered a priority. China and India are two emerging powers that have been identified as potential competitors for Europe in many areas, including defence. This paper focuses on innovativeness in defence in these two countries. It analyses the innovating capacity of the private sector, as well as the role of public institutions and defence industries in innovate defence sectors.

The Indian government’ s decision to increase the defence allocation for 2010-11 to Rs 1,42,500 crore (USD 32.5 billion) is a welcome step. It is also an acknowledgement of the fact that the country’ S security is being threatened by a variety of factors, including the ongoing internal insurgency in the Northeast, the threat from Pakistan and China, and the growing incidence of terrorism. The decision has also come in for criticism from several quarters for its inadequacy.

As a part of the Make in Indiadrive, the Indian government has taken several initiatives to promote indigenous manufacturing and to increase the share of domestic manufacture in the defence industry. The government launched the ‘Make’ procedure in 2013, which is an initiative to encourage indian companies to manufacturer in-house and promote domestic production. It also introduced the “Make II” procedure, aimed at increasing the indigeneity of indiand products. In 1998, India launched a programme to develop indigeous military equipment. This programme was aiming to build a strong indiginous defence industrial base and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers. To achieve this, indien defence industries were encouraged to establish joint ventures with foreign companies.

The Indian government has clearly made it clear that it will not compromise on its security concerns. In fact, it has reiterated that its nuclear weapons programme will remain as an ""insurance policy"" against any eventuality. The government also made clear its position that India will continue to remain a non-nuclear weapons state. However, in the changed global context, India has decided to go ahead with the nuclear agreement with US. While the US has made its commitment to India, there are some who question the wisdom of this decision. They are of the opinion that this deal is not in India' s interest.

In its current form, the BMS is a layered system, which includes the Phased Array Radar (PAR) and the Advanced Air Defensse (AAD) interceptor. This paper analyses the current state of India’s BDM program and its future prospects, and also discusses threaths that India may face in the future.

Indian military leadership has been in the news for all the wrong reasons in recent times. In a span of less than two years, the Indian Army has had three chiefs, and the Navy has seen two chief commanders. The Army’s third chief, General Bipin Rawat, was appointed on December 31, 2016.

In 1998, India became the only country to have conducted a nuclear test. Since then, the country has been under a lot of international pressure to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). In the past, there have been many attempts to persuade India to join the treaty, but to no avail.
India has always been reluctant to do so, and for good reason. The CTBT is a flawed treat. It does not provide for the verification of nuclear tests. This means that India would be able to conduct nuclear weapons tests without any international oversight. Additionally, it does nothing to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. India is not the first country that has refused to ratify the CBTT.

Indian Defence Expenditures in Global Perspective
In the last two decades, India’s defence budget has grown at a rate of 10 percent per annum. This is a remarkable achievement in a country where defence spending is perceived as a drain on the economy. India is the world’ s fourth largest military spender, with a defence outlay of US$ 55.6 billion in 2018-19. The country’S defence allocation is expected to grow to USD 62.5 billion by 3032-33, and US $ 80 billion to 700 by the year 02524.

India has been a free and independent nation for more than 50 years. In this time, it has developed a formidable defence capability. This has enabled the country to play an active role in international affairs, including peacekeeping and disaster relief operations. India has also been an important partner in global economic growth. But the rapid changes in technology, the globalisation of the economy and the emergence of new security threats have created new challenges for India. These challengers will require a more proactive approach to defence, both at home and abroad.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between defence expenditure and real GDP growth in Pakistan and India, using the co-integration and error correction methods. The study has found that defence budget has a negative effect on real growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in both countries. For Pakistan, the defence-Gross National Products (GNP) ratio is 2.5 percent while for India it is less than 1 percent. However, in the short run, defence has no significant effect in India but it has significant negative impact in case of Pakistan.

India is the most important U.S. partner in Asia. The two countries have a long history of cooperation, and their relationship has been strengthened by the UPA government’s reform agenda. In 1998, India conducted its first nuclear test, which led to a UNSC resolution condemning the test and calling on India to suspend all nuclear tests. India, however, refused to do so. Instead, it conducted another series of tests in 90s, after which it became a de facto nuclear weapons state. This led the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on New Delhi.

India's defence procurement process is a complex and unwieldy bureaucratic mess, with the acquisitions process taking anywhere between 10 to 20 years to complete.
In comparison, the US defence industry is one of the most advanced in the world, and has a robust and efficient acqui-sition system in place. This paper examines the defence-acquisition process in India and the United States, including the bidding, evaluation and awarding process, as well as the role of various institutions in this process. It then exam-ines how the Indian defence sector can learn from the American defence system, to make India'a defence pro-curements system more efficient.",338,182,0.5827338129496403,6.870330330407765,0.8905608205096683,0.05106785985675675,0.8720000000000001,0.8566956521739136,0.7741324914268167,56.84350433211789,59.805755395683455,45.81294030404153

1. Introduction The defence industry is a key sector for the economic growth of any country. In the context of India, the country’s defence industrial base has been characterised by a combination of imports and indigenous production. While the former has ensured the availability of a wide range of defence equipment to the Armed Forces, it has also led to a high dependence on imports. Moreover, a large part of these imports are from a limited number of countries, which in turn has resulted in a vulnerable supply chain.
The defence policy of 2013 has, therefore, sought to promote indigeneous design, development and manufacturing of equipment by the private sector. The policy also encourages foreign collaboration and technology transfers for defence production, subject to certain conditions. This has led the Government to consider relaxing the existing FDI policy in defence. Recent policy announcements have, however, been met with criticism from",346,194,0.5263157894736842,7.2547625011001164,0.8776727765405299,0.05368163693008349,0.8571428571428571,0.8486746987951812,0.7498783547601952,55.27310017271158,54.01052631578948,51.19647930194805

2 I think the problem with the defense system is that the people in charge of it are not in the military. They are politicians. Politicians are good at a lot of things, but they are definitely not good leaders in battle. It is a well known fact that a good leader in war is someone who can be decisive and make the right decision in a split second. The problem is, the politicans don't have this ability. So, they make decisions based on what they think will get them votes. This is not a recipe for success in military matters. We need to elect people who have military experience.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has been a major player in the defence of the country. It has not only played a vital role in defending the borders but also provided strategic mobility to the Indian Army during operations in Kargil and Operation Parakram.
With the introduction of supersonic fighter aircraft, the IAF has become a formidable force in South Asia. However, it is not just the number of aircraft that is important but the quality of pilots and the availability of spare parts. The IAf has taken several initiatives to improve its operational efficiency. These include the re-organisation",361,194,0.632258064516129,7.871549423244489,0.9090979587045557,0.041501495582326624,0.8666666666666667,0.8680916030534352,0.8225914147557618,72.29166666666666,79.87741935483871,71.65284542425019

In a bid to further strengthen the defence ties between India and Malaysia, the two countries signed a defence framework agreement on 26th January 1994. The agreement provided a legal framework for the bilateral defence relations between the countries. However, it was only in 30th September 06 that the Malaysian government decided to upgrade the relationship with India to a “Strategic Partnership”.

In a recent interview with The Economic Times, the Defender of the Realm, Mr. Manohar Parrikar, expressed his concern about the inability of India to spend on defense in proportion to its growing economy. The Defensive Minister was quoted as saying, “India is a big country and a fast-growing economy, but we are spending only 2 percent of GDP on defence. We should be speding 3 percent to 4 percent.”
This statement is noteworthy for at least three reasons.

Sir John Simon, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was the most important member of Britain’s war cabinet, and he was responsible for the formulation of its foreign policy. His policy was based on the belief that Britain had to act in concert with France and Russia.
Simon’ s policy had three main aspects: first, it was a policy of support for Russia; second, a commitment to France; and third, an attempt to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Simon believed that the first two of these aspects were necessary for Britain to be able to defend its interests, but the third was necessary to ensure that Europe was not dominated by a single power. He argued that if Britain did not support Russia, France would be forced to take on Germany alone. If Britain supported France, Germany would have to deal with the French alone, which would leave Britain exposed to the possibility of",371,188,0.4846938775510204,6.785714285714286,0.862784760394811,0.059860345150701204,0.8514285714285714,0.8520930232558142,0.7674593030545818,49.0,50.53061224489796,50.36979472140762

The United States and India have recently agreed to elevate their relationship to a “major defence partner” status. The designation is meant to signal to the world that the two countries will have an even closer defence relationship than they have in the past.
As the United State’s largest arms supplier, India has been a key defence and security partner for decades. India is also the second largest buyer of US military equipment in Asia, behind only Japan. And the US is India’ s second-largest arms exporter, after Russia. In 2015, the Obama administration cleared the way for India to purchase US drones, and in 1998 the Clinton administration approved the sale of the C-17 Globemaster III aircraft to India. This was the first time the administration had approved a major arms sale to an Asian country.

India’s defence sector is one of the largest in the world, and it has been growing rapidly in recent years. With a strong focus on research and development, India is now able to produce advanced weapons and systems that are competitive with those of other countries.
The Indian defence market is projected to reach $150 billion by 2025, making it one the most lucrative markets in Asia. India’smilitary expenditure has increased steadily since 1998, reaching $65 billion in 0014. The government has also been investing heavily in new technologies and equipment, which is expected to drive further growth in this sector. In addition, there is a growing demand for defence products from countries around the globe, providing opportunities for Indian companies to export their products and services.

Provocation is a mitigating factor in criminal cases. It can be used as an affirmative defense, or it can serve as the basis for a lesser charge. However, it is important to note that proving provoca-tion is not an easy task. In order to be successful, the defendant must be able to show that the other person was the cause of his or her actions.

However, the Indian government is not keen on acquiring a dedicated AWACs, which is believed to be a very expensive system, especially when the country is looking at alternatives to reduce the budgetary allocation for the defense sector.

China is a nuclear power. It has the third largest nuclear arsenal in terms of the number of warheads in its inventory. Its nuclear forces are believed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons by land, sea and air. However, the Chinese nuclear force is not the most important aspect of China' s nuclear policy. China has been pursuing a policy of nuclear progression. In other words, it has a programme of increasing the nuclear capability of its forces. This policy is reflected in China's nuclear doctrine which is based on the concept of minimum deterrence. The Chinese are concerned about the pro-lifers in Pakistan and Iran. They are worried about Pakistan''s ability to develop and deploy nuclear-armed missiles. Pakistan has tested a missile with a range of 2,00 km.

The Indian defence sector is a key area of focus for the Indian government.
In 2015, the government launched the ‘Make in India’ initiative, aimed at boosting the manufacturing sector and creating jobs. The initiatives are expected to increase the share of defence manufacturers in the global defence market to 50 per cent by 100. India is already the second largest importer of arms and defence equipment in Asia after China. In the last 40 years, India has imported more than $25 billion worth of weapons.

The Indian government is considering a major restructuring of its military command and control. The Indian military is currently divided into three commands, each headed by a lieutenant general. It is proposed that the army, navy and air force will be brought under a single integrated command, with the chief of defence staff (CDS) as its head. This would be a historic development in India’s defence organisation, which has remained largely unchanged for decades.
A CDS will have the authority to exercise control over all three services, and will also be responsible for the overall planning and execution of military operations. He will act as the military adviser to the government and be the principal military spokesperson. Currently, the three service chiefs are the primary military interlocutors with political leaders. There are many advantages to having a CDC.

The North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) is one of the most important areas of Pakistan. It is the gateway to the Central Asian republics and a vital link in any future trade with China. In 1914, the British government was concerned about the security of India’s northwestern frontiers. The British Indian Army’ s North West Frontiers Force (the NWFF) was a force of about 20,00 men, commanded by Major-General Sir Charles Monro, which was to be deployed in India to defend the NWF. This force was stationed at Peshawar, a city in northwest Pakistan, on the border with Afghanistan.

The cost of research, development and production of any defence system is a function of its complexity, technical and schedule risks. It is essential to have a cost estimate of the project at the beginning of development to be able to assess the cost and time overruns and to take corrective measures. In this paper, a method for the estimation and analysis of cost risk is presented. The method is based on the concept of probability of occurrence of risk and probability distribution of costs. A model is developed for estimation the probability distributions of project cost, schedule and technical risk.

Greening Indian Defence Forces: A Conceptual Framework Towards Accelerating Carbon Neutrality In India -
The concept of green defence was first introduced in the 1980s. The term was defined as the military’s responsibility to protect the environment and to reduce its own environmental impact. Since then, the concept has evolved to include a wide range of activities, including energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction, and pollution prevention.
In recent years, there has been growing interest in green defense among military leaders and policymakers. This is due, in part, to the increasing awareness of the importance of environmental sustainability and the need to address climate change. Green defense is also seen as a way to enhance military readiness and resilience by reducing the risks posed by climate-related disasters",409,181,0.5962732919254659,7.565859899895366,0.898245418711485,0.046109021284217726,0.8533333333333334,0.8543065693430664,0.80604234359456,64.41020837536388,68.42857142857143,61.5622863004331

The Indian defence budget has been in a state of flux since the mid-1990s. The Indian armed forces have been underfunded for decades, but the situation became more critical during the 15-year tenure of former Prime Minister Vajpayee.
Vajapayee’s tenures (10 years in power) saw defence spending rise from 2.7% of GDP to 3.2% in 5 years. However, this was not enough to meet the demands of a growing military and a large number of ageing equipment. Since 9/11, the Indian military has had to deal with an increased threat from Pakistan and China, which has resulted in increased expenditure on the military. In the last decade, defence expenses have increased to around 4% GPD.

What should the Indian defence industry do to become a successful exporters?
India is a country with a large population, a strong economy, and a growing defence sector. In recent years, India has been increasingly looking to export its defence products and services. This is due to a number of factors, including the increasing demand for defence equipment from countries around the world, as well as the growing need for India to generate revenue from its exports.
There are a few things that the defence manufacturers in India can do in order to make their products more export-friendly. Firstly, they should focus on developing products that are tailored to the needs of the export market. Secondly
1. India should continue to invest in its domestic defence capabilities. 2. The government should provide incentives for Indian companies to produce defence exports, such as tax breaks and subsidies.3.",424,187,0.5136612021857924,6.948679946972985,0.8721195620784874,0.05652296241981945,0.84,0.866666666666666,0.7610245859660614,51.93770777925532,53.387978142076506,53.38529493215176

India is a big market for defence and security products and services. The country is one of the biggest arms importers in the world. India is also the second largest arms buyer after the US. However, the country has been struggling to procures arms and equipment from the international market. This is because the Indian defence establishment is not a single entity. It is made up of different arms of services and agencies. These agency and departments are under the control of civilian bureaucracy and politicians. They are not accountable to the people.

India is a country with an economy that is on the rise and a growing middle class. It is also a nuclear power with a large military. As it becomes increasingly important for India to maintain its security and stability, it is essential that it has a strong military-industrial complex. This complex will provide the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the military, as well as the economy.
The economic imperative for developing a robust military is clear: a well-equipped military can help ensure that India remains secure in the face of threats from both within and outside its borders. The defence industry in India is currently worth about $25 billion, and is expected to grow to $50 billion by 2022. A strong and efficient military will also help India maintain stability in its region, which is important given that the country has border disputes with both China and Pakistan.

The Defence Procurements Procedure (DPP) of 2005 has been a major step forward in terms of opening up the defence sector to foreign vendors. However, the DPP has not been able to fulfil its objectives because of a number of procedural and institutional bottlenecks.
In the wake of the 1962 war with China, defence preparedness in India took a backseat and was given low priority. In the post-1231 war years, India was more focused on the political and economic fronts and defence was relegated to the back burner. This resulted in a significant decline in the country's defence capabilities and a corresponding increase in defence imports. The defence budget remained stagnant at around 3% of GDP and the acquisition process was inefficient and protracted.

The current reformation of the Chinese military is an attempt to address the shortcomings of its existing military structure, which is based on the Soviet model of military organization. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone a number of changes over the years, including the introduction of a new command structure and the expansion of joint operations.
One of China’ s most important military reorganizations is the creation of seven military regions. This change has made it easier for the PLA to respond to threats and has also improved the coordination between different branches of service. Additionally, the new military districts have improved communication and coordi- nation between the military and civilian authorities. These changes have made China a more formidable military power and have increased its ability to project power abroad.

The defence under Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code is available only to the accused persons who are suffering from a mental disease. The defence is not available to a person who has a defect of reason, but is capable of knowing what he is doing.
Insanity is a state of mind where the person is unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts. In other words, the law does not recognize a man’s right to kill another person because he happens to be insane. It is the duty of a court to protect society from such persons. Hence, insa nity as a defence has been rejected by the courts. However, in the case of R. v. Dudley and Stephens (1883) 11 QBD 273, it was held that if a defendant is suffering form a severe mental disorder, he may be acquitted.

Indian defense,private defence under indian criminal law,"private defence under indian criminal law

This article discusses the issue of private self-defence under Indian criminal laws.
Private self defence is a complete defence to a criminal charge if it is proved that the accused has acted in self defense. It is not necessary that there should be a reasonable apprehension of danger to the life or physical safety of the person. Even if the appellant had not reason to believe that his life was in danger, he can still claim private defense if he had acted to protect his property. The right of self protection is inherent in the right to life. In the absence of any statutory provision, the common law position is that a person can use force to defend himself and his family, his body and property from assault, and to prevent crime. 
The right is limited by the principle that it must be used in proportion to, or not exceeding, that which is necessary to repel the assault. This is known as the ""proport",450,197,0.4603174603174603,6.328318816843779,0.8519884889186642,0.0650182273254042,0.7999999999999999,0.841454545454546,0.754116976275968,43.24576271186441,43.02116402116402,42.65752953552355

India is a country that has long been associated with the pursuit of knowledge and learning. From the days of the ancient Vedic civilization to the modern era, India has been home to some of history’s most important thinkers and philosophers.
Today, however, the country is facing a crisis of ideas. In recent years, there has emerged a growing sense of intolerance and authoritarianism, as well as a climate of fear and repression. This has had a profound effect on the intellectual life of India, with many of its brightest minds leaving the county in search of more tolerant and open societies. As a result, it is more important than ever that we defend the spirit of free thought and critical inquiry in India.

India's defence relationship with the United States is a key pillar of the strategically important bilateral relationship. The two countries have been working closely in the field of defence for several years now.
The two have also been developing the capability to produce advanced military platforms and systems together. A number of joint programmes have already been initiated. These include the Joint Strike Fighter programme, the C-130J transport aircraft, and the UAVs. India is also seeking to buy the Boeing C17 transport plane, which is expected to be approved soon. In addition, India and US are working on the development of a new generation of jet fighter aircraft. This is the F-21 programme.

This study is an attempt to evaluate the foreign aid received by Pakistan and India and their military strengths and defence policies. It also tries to compare the military assistance and military capabilities of the two countries. The study uses a quantitative approach and relies on secondary data.
The study finds that India is the largest recipient of military equipment from the United States. India receives 40 per cent of all military sales from America. Pakistan is ranked second with 14 per cents of total military imports from USA. On the other hand, India’s military expenditure is 3.6 percents higher than that of Pakistan. Furthermore, the study reveals that Pakistan has a higher military-to-GDP ratio than India. This implies that the Pakistani military is more powerful than the Indian military.

India’s defence forces operate in a vast geographical area and require accurate position information for their operations. The Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has developed a GPS/INS based navigation system called the INSAT Navigation System (INSNAV) for the Indian armed forces.
The INSNAR system is based on a single frequency GNSS receiver and an inertial navigation unit (IMU) with an accuracy of approximately 500 m.

There were no new contracts signed, but the contract for a $2 billion deal for 46 naval multi-role helicopters was given to the AgustaWestland, a company owned by the Finmeccaanca.

India is a major military power, with the world' s second largest armed forces. It has a wide range of capabilities, including nuclear weapons. Its defence budget is the third largest in the World. However, the defence spending is only about 2.2% of GDP, which is less than the 3% minimum that is recommended by the UN.
The defence budgets of other countries are much higher. For example, China'S defence outlay is about $ 110 billion, or 4.6%of GNP. This is more than double the Indian figure. The United States, on the other hand, spends about six times more on defence, about eight percent of its Gross National Product (GNP).

It is also based upon the idea that all cultures are equal and that they are in competition with each other. Therefore, it assumes that multicultural societies are inherently unstable. This is a very misleading assumption. In fact, multcultral societes are not inherantly unstabe. They are only unstabale if they have a weak political system. If the political systems are strong, then multculural socities can be stable. India is an example of a multulcual society that is stable despite having a large number of different cultrues. Another example is",466,180,0.5126582278481012,6.444014001823413,0.8680230447042022,0.06002616600782077,0.7666666666666666,0.7817910447761198,0.7306218041160963,31.751923076923077,35.18354430379747,34.12034411041785

The defence industrial sector is one of the most important sectors for the development of a country. A country with strong defence capabilities is able to protect its citizens and its territory. In addition, a strong military also helps to deter potential threats and to maintain peace and stability in the region.
India is a major player in defence manufacturing and has a significant presence in global markets. The country is home to a number of leading defence companies, including Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, and Larsen & Toubro. India is also a member of several multilateral defence organisations, such as the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Wassenaar Arrangement.

India is at the forefront of cyberspace development, but its cybertroopers are not fully prepared to meet the challenges of the new era of war.
By R. Sridhar
The Indian Army has been working on its network-enabled warfighting concept for some time. But the concept of network centricity and the associated need for cyberexpertise has not been fully assimilated by the force. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has done better. It is already a networked force and is looking to further enhance its capabilities. In contrast, the Indian Navy is still struggling to integrate its networks. However, it has started to address the cybernetworking aspect of its war-facing capabilities and has begun to recruit cybettroops.

The Indian Army is the world’s second largest standing army, with over 1.2 million active personnel. It is also the second most expensive standing military, after the US. India’ defence budget is over $40 billion a year, and is growing at a rate of 8-9 per cent annually. This is in sharp contrast to the declining defence budgets of the West. In the last decade, India has increased its defence expenditure by more than 300 per
cent, while the USA and UK have cut their defence spending by over a third.

India has a reputation for being an arms importer, and is often criticised for its lack of a long-term defence industrial policy. This book examines the reasons for the apparent lackadaisical approach to defence procurement and provides a detailed analysis of the various arms imports over the past two decades. It looks at the procured equipment, the defence and strategic environment in which it was acquired, its role in the development of Indian defence industries, India' s defence doctrine and the country'S political and economic situation. The book also analyses the implications of India becoming a nuclear weapon state and its potential impact on defence acquisitions.",496,190,0.6375838926174496,7.782703244930885,0.9100571055668271,0.041387567987388886,0.8720000000000001,0.8646400000000007,0.8084280722126207,78.4805104192508,75.66442953020135,64.62859275849198

The role and effect of various phythophylogical parameters on the expression of defence genes in plants will be studied.
The project will also focus on studying the effect and role phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications on defence proteins in relation to the development of disease resistance.

India has a lot to be proud of. It is one of the world' s largest democracies, with a population of over a billion people.
It is also one the fastest growing economies in the developing world. In the past decade, India'
s GDP has grown at an average rate of 7 per cent, making it one
of the top five fast growing countries in Asia. India has the fourth largest army in
the world, and is the third largest arms importer. This is a remarkable achievement for a country that was once one-third of its current size. However, despite these achievements, the country still faces a number of challenges. One of these is its defence. The country has been spending more on defence than any other country in South Asia, but it is still struggling to defend itself. There are a few reasons for this.
