Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure in India,"Infrastructure in India: A New Dawn
India is set to be the fastest growing major economy in the world in 2018. The government’s policy initiatives to improve infrastructure, increase ease of doing business and focus on manufacturing, coupled with the continued economic growth, will drive the need for more efficient, cost effective and reliable infrastructural development.
The country’ s infrastruc-ture sector is expected to receive a boost from the government, which has announced a slew of initi-atives in its Union Budget 17-108, including a national highway development fund, a highway asset recycling fund and a rural roads development agency. It has also set aside Rs. 4.97 lakh crore for the railways, R3.28 lacr for roads and highways and R69,0",0,182,0.647887323943662,7.72046849632954,0.9124185578900518,0.040692243833645364,0.8640000000000001,0.8766101694915258,0.8236812493998324,72.31481481481481,81.54929577464789,81.53681568252449

Infrastructure is one of the most important sectors of an economy. It is an important factor in the growth of any economy and has a significant impact on the lives of people. Infrastructures are the basic facilities that are required to sustain the economy of a country and they play a crucial role in improving the quality of life.
The infrastructural facilities of India are one-of-a-kind and have been developed over the years. India is a developing country that has been able to develop its infrastruc­ture over time. The infrastru­cture of Ind­ia is divided into three categories: physical, social, and economic infrastr­ucture. Physical infrastruture is the physical infrastrut­ure that is needed for the development of industries and the provision of services. Social infrastrur­e is required for social welfare and health care.

Infrastructural services are an important input in the production of manufactured goods. This paper examines the role of infrastructure in economic growth and development. Using a cross-sectional data set for 188 manufactures from 31 states of India, it finds that the share of external inputs in total manufacture value added is higher in manufacturers using more infrastructures. The study also finds a positive and significant relationship between the provision of public infrastruncture and the manufacturer's share in output.

Subjects: Waste management
Abstract: 'Waste' is a key term in the literature on globalisation and development. It is often used to describe the 'wasteful' production of the global North, and the inefficiency of its recycling. In contrast, the waste of global South is seen as a valuable resource. This article argues that these opposing views of 'global waste' are both wrong. Rather than being a problem to be solved, waste is central to the functioning of contemporary capitalism. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in Delhi, it shows that waste management is not just a technical problem of recycle, reuse or dispose, but a political one of how wastefulness is defined. The article highlights how 'infrastructure' (defined here as the political, legal",8,191,0.5325443786982249,6.923076923076923,0.8771731997827062,0.055131528889209185,0.8066666666666666,0.8273103448275861,0.753545258723034,41.897567339139385,41.72781065088758,40.64637239979706

The Indian economy has been growing at a rate of 7.5% per annum for the past decade. This growth has led to a significant increase in infrastructural development in the country, with the government allocating 6% of the GDP to infrastruc-tural expenditure in 2011-12. The Indian government has recently announced a National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) of Rs. 102 lakh crores. While the overall NIP is a welcome initiative, there is little information on the sector-wise allocation of funds.

India’s infrastructural growth has been constrained by lack of access to capital, particularly for infrastruc-ture projects that are large in scale and have long gestation periods. The Indian Government has initiated a number of measures to encourage private sector participation in the infrastru-cture sector. Among these, the most significant has probably been the introduction of the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme. Under this scheme, VGFCs are formed with the purpose of providing the ‘gap’ funding for a project. VCFs, which are typically private equity funds, are given the mandate to invest in projects identified by the VFCSs. This paper examines the impact of syndicated VGC investment on the project performance.

Indian Smart Infrastructure Development
The term smart road is used to describe a roadway that is designed to maximize the use of technology to improve traffic flow, reduce traffic congestion, improve safety, and reduce the environmental impact of roadways. Smarts roads are a new concept in road design that will have a significant impact on the way we travel and the world around us.
Smart roads can be divided into two categories: those that use technology and those without. The first category includes smart parking, smart traffic signals, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and intelligently connected vehicles (ICVs). The second category does not use any technology, but rather relies on human drivers to make decisions about their travel. This second type of smarts road can include things like traffic lights, speed limits, stop signs, etc. In this article we will discuss the benefits of using smart technology in roads",22,191,0.5217391304347826,7.0772138954350625,0.8752453344814665,0.055083752984934106,0.8685714285714285,0.8707499999999992,0.7930054170367024,45.74246339362618,58.82608695652174,54.86474912112496

The Indian government has set a target of completing 100 smart cities in the next 5 years. This ambitious goal can only be achieved by the use of advanced technologies in infrastructural projects. However, the government and private players face a lot of challenges in this regard.
There are many challenging factors that hinder the implementation of automated processes in India’s infrastrucutural sector. These factors include:
Lack of skilled labour
India’smassive population is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides a huge labour force to the country, but on the other hand it creates a skilling problem.

Infrastructural development is one of the major thrust areas of government policy. However, the lack of effective governments and weak institutions in the country have resulted in poor infrastructures.
The infrastructure sector in India has been growing at a fast pace and is expected to continue to grow at the same pace in coming years. The sector is characterized by a large number of projects with a high degree of complexity. These projects are often complex because they involve multiple stakeholders and involve a number
of different technologies. This complexity makes it difficult for the government to manage the projects and ensure that they are completed on time and within budget. As a result, there is a need for better governances in infrastrucutre projects. Governance refers to the way in which a government or an organization is organized and managed. It includes the processes by which decisions are made",24,180,0.5294117647058824,6.902684899626333,0.8761655515660626,0.055519966069169494,0.8333333333333334,0.842465753424657,0.7688968458424826,50.593660691088594,51.16470588235294,46.11474184782608

Author: K. S. Subramanian
This article examines the role of India in the infrastructure building of Africa. The article argues that India’s infrastructural engagement in Africa is a manifestation of the South’S- South Co-operation and a new form of asymmetrical relationship between the two regions. It also contends that the building and sharing of infrastruc-ture in India and Africa can be seen as an expression of a globalized world, where the economic, social and political interactions between states are increasingly interdependent.

In 2014, India was the first country in the world to launch a national digital payments system. Today, 80 per cent of all digital transactions in our country are done through the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). In a country where the vast majority of citizens are still unfamiliar with the concept of a debit card or a credit card, this is a remarkable achievement. It has also helped to boost financial inclusion in a big way. Even as we are in lockdown, more than 100 million Indians are using UPI to pay for their groceries, medicines, and other essentials.

The construction industry in the developing world is responsible for significant environmental impacts, including significant material wastage, which can be attributed to inefficient use of resources. The circular economy concept is gaining momentum as a potential solution to address the issues of material use efficiency and waste. This paper presents a methodology for estimating the material circular potential (MCP) of construction material. It was applied to the Indian transport infrastructures sector, where construction activities are carried out in a large scale. A case study of a highway project in Punjab, India, was used to demonstrate the application of the method. MCP was calculated for 20 construction elements. Materials with high MPC were identified, and the key drivers of MCF were analyzed. Results showed that the MCA of cement, steel, aggregate, bitumen, plastic, wood, glass,",30,197,0.55,7.379024325749306,0.8848754153131206,0.051046862153629594,0.8457142857142858,0.8541025641025644,0.7542513298667032,45.45090579309429,48.294444444444444,51.51869137601311

The 'development plan—town planning scheme' mechanism is used by the Egyptian government to acquire land for urban development in Cairos suburban areas. The mechanism was introduced in 2002 as a means to provide an alternative to the traditional land acquisition mechanism of the state. It is based on a system of land rights and land valuation that allows the government and the private sector to obtain land at market price. This mechanism has been criticised for its lack of transparency and its failure to protect the interests of poorer landowners. In this paper, the author examines the effectiveness of this mechanism in terms of its impact on the land market, its effect on urban land use, and whether it is a viable alternative for land development.

The Indian economy is in a state of transformation. In the last few years, the country has been able to reduce poverty and increase its growth rate. The country is also making a significant contribution to global economic growth. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure that the benefits of economic development are shared by all.
One of the major challenging areas in rural India is the lack of adequate infrastructural facilities. Rural areas are often deprived of basic amenities like roads, electricity, and water supply. This results in poor living conditions and hinders economic activity. Therefore, it is essential to invest in infrastruture in these areas to improve living standards and promote economic activities. There are various initiatives that are being taken by the government to promote rural development. These include the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Y",42,182,0.5562130177514792,7.230769230769231,0.8856499971536249,0.051326668725824635,0.8333333333333334,0.8441379310344835,0.7653536642683844,54.03698336693549,52.43195266272189,50.611858704793946

B. Chandrasekhar, V. Venkateswaran, S. K. Garg
This paper analyses the impact of infrastructure and information and communication technologies (ICT) on the productivity performance (PP) of Indian firments. The study uses the annual data for the period 1998-2007 for 3224 firmen from the manufacture sector. We find that the infrastructural quality of firment's location and ICT investment have a significant and positive impact on their PP. Our results also indicate that ITC investments have been more effective than infrastruture investmrnts in improving the PPP of manufacturers.

This paper examines the impact of state-level infrastructural development on the productivity of Indian manufacturers. The analysis is based on a dataset of 1,291 manufacture units in 23 Indian States for the period 31 March 03 to 5 April 97. We use a two-stage least squares estimator to estimate the parameters of a stochastic frontier production function, which is assumed to be a Cobb-Douglas function of capital, labour and a set of inputs which include infrastruc-ture. Our results indicate that the level of productive efficiency is higher in the states which have developed their infrastru-cture better than the others.

Innovation in infrastructural development is a key challenge for India. The country is the world’s fastest growing major economy, but the infrastruc­ture is not keeping pace with the needs of the growing population.
The automotive industry is well positioned to be a catalyst for infrastru­ctural innovation. It can do so by developing new mobility solutions that reduce the need for automobiles and by providing innovative solutions to address the existing infrastrutural challenges. This paper presents a set of case studies that highlight how the automo­bile industry has responded innovatively to infrastruture challeng­es in the past.

The Indian government has embarked on a major public–private investment programme to upgrade the country’s infrastructural deficiencies. The public sector is increasingly using the public private partnership (PPP) model to fund such projects, which are financed through a combination of government funds, private investments and external finance.
Between 2004 and 08, the government’ s invest­ment in the infrastruc­ture sector rose by 13% a year to reach Rs 3,10,012 crore (Rs1.2 trillion). The government is planning to increase this to R2,64,711 cr (US$55.5 billion) by the end of the 5-year plan period. This has led to a surge in PPP projects.

The present paper investigates the causality between transport infrastructures and economic growth and its impact on urbanisation in the Indian context. The study has used data on transport, economy and population for 18 states of India for the period 21 years (i.e. 31st March 91 to 4th January 09). The unit root test, cointegration test and Granger causation test are applied to examine the long-run relationship and causally related relationship between the variables. This study finds that transport plays a significant role in economic and social development in Indian states. It is observed that there is a positive relationship among the transport sector, population and economy. Transport sector has a strong and positive impact upon the economic performance of the state. Therefore, the development of transportation system is the key to the socio-economic development.

The results show that human capi-tal and accessibility to roads and electricity have a positive impact on rice production, while the effect of education is mixed. Investments in education and other infrastru-cture have the potential to increase the income of small and marginal farmer households.

The idea of ‘alternatives’ to the ailing neoliberal order has gained currency in recent years. It is being used to describe a variety of approaches to economic development, from state-led industrialization to community-based production. The idea that there are ‘good’ alternatives to neo-liberlism is premised on the notion that the latter is a system of economic governance that is fundamentally flawed. This is because it is based on a set of ideas and policies that are inimical to human welfare. These ideas include a focus on profit maximization and efficiency, the belief that markets are self-regulating, and the idea (which is",62,189,0.559748427672956,7.058159112891483,0.8855240088708072,0.05200151752016591,0.86,0.8453333333333343,0.7636011185748501,52.917956656346746,54.61635220125786,50.40710964742348

This paper traces the infrastructural speculation on India's railroads between 28 August 80, when the first railway line in India opened between Bori Bunder and Thane, and 30 September 44, the day the British government nationalised the country' s rail system. The paper argues that the history of infrastruc- tural investment in colonial India can be seen as a series of speculative bubbles, each of which was followed by a crisis of investor confidence, which in turn led to the creation of new forms of government-led infrastru- cture. These bubble-and-crisis cycles were repeated on an increasingly global scale between the 60s and the present day.

The study examines the role played by public investment in infrastructures in the process of regional economic development in India. It focuses on the experiences of the states of Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradsh. The study argues that public sector investing in roads, irrigation, drinking water, power, telecommunications, ports, airports, railways, etc. is a necessary but not sufficient condition for economic growth and development.

Infrastructure plays a crucial role in the development of a region. It is an important factor in attracting investment and improving the quality of life for the people living there. Infrastructures can also help to create jobs and boost the economy.
However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure that infrastructural development is sustainable and benefits everyone. These challengers include:
The lack of coordination between different levels of government when it comes to infrastricture planning and development. This can lead to duplication of effort and resources, as well as delays in projects being completed. Additionally, a lack coordiantion can result in inefficient use of resources and poor quality infrastruture. Finally, if there is a mismatch between the needs of the region and the infrastrcture that is being built, this can have a negative impact on economic growth and job creation",69,196,0.5561797752808989,7.420363721059028,0.886783441557603,0.0503090793390739,0.8742857142857143,0.8776623376623376,0.7877804130278436,57.210339344101975,65.56741573033707,65.7735462184874

China and india have experienced rapid economic growth over the past few decades. However, water resources have not kept pace with this growth, and water supply and sanitation (WSS) services have been a major challenge for both countries. China’s water sector has been dominated by the state and investment in infrastructures has largely been financed through state funding. In India, the central government has played a more limited role in water and WSS, with most of the investments being made by state governments and the private sector. The financially constrained nature of state-owned enterprises in India has led to inefficient WS services. This paper examines the policy dimensions and institutional arrangements that have contributed to the development of WAS in China, India and other countries in the region. It also examined the role of public and private investors and institutions in finanancing WASS infrastru...

It is found that the Indian road system is characterized by poor network density. However, the network is not well connected. This is because of low road connectivity, which is a result of poor road design and low level of maintenance. Moreover, high traffic volume and poor traffic management are responsible for the high level road accident rate.

Rural India is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in terms of economic and social development. In this paper we use a panel dataset of Indian states for the period 1993-2005 to examine the linkage between infrastructural development and economic performance in rural India. We find that a one standard deviation increase in the road density index is associated with an increase of about 7.5 per cent in agriculture output. This positive association is found to be more pronounced in states with a higher share of agriculturally dominant districts. Further, we find a positive link between the electricity density and the agricultura l output in India, which is more prominent in those states where the share in electric power intensive sectors is higher.

Economic development is dependent on the availability of infrastructures, such as transportation, energy, water, telecommunications and sanitation. Infrastructure investments are critical to a country’s economic growth. However, many developing countries are unable to meet the increasing demand for infrastrucutre due to their limited financial resources. The lack of financing is one of the biggest obstacles to infrastruture development.
In the past, infrastruucture financies were mostly provided by the government. But with the rise of private sector participation, the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) has become more important. PPPs allow the private sectors to finance and operate infrastrcutures in exchange for a share of revenues. This is a win-win situation for both the public and private partners.

Jayant M. Patil, R. Mishra
Municipal waste water is a major source of pollution in urban areas. It contains various pollutants such as nutrients, organic matter, heavy metals, suspended solids, pathogens, and microorganisms. In India, the municipal waste-water treatment plants are designed to treat only domestic waste. The treatment of municipal wastes is an important issue in developing countries. This paper describes the characteristics and treatment technologies of the wastewaters from the domestic and industrial sources in Indian cities.

The Government of India (GoI) has identified the need to improve the financing of public-private partnership (PPP) infrastructural projects. This is because the PFIs (public financial institutions) are not able to finance such projects on their own, and the government's own resources are limited. The government has been trying to overcome this problem by encouraging PPPS (project preparation support), and by setting up a PPI (Project Preparation Institute).

India’s infrastructure deficit has been a major constraint on its economic growth. The country’ s economic performance has improved in the past few years, but infrastructural bottlenecks have been slowing down the growth momentum. A lack of investment in infrastruc- ture has resulted in delays in completion of projects, and the consequent dela- yed completion has led to an increase in project costs.
The infrastru-cture sector in 2013 accounted for 37.6% of the total capital expenditure (capex) of Central and State governments. Investment of Rs 11.1 trillion was made in this sector, which was 4.2% higher than the previous year. However, this invest- ment was still below the target of 9% to 8% for the next decade.

India’s urban infrastructure is in dire need of an overhaul. The country’ s cities are in a state of disrepair and are struggling to keep up with rising urbanisation. This is leading to a slowdown in economic growth and the creation of a vicious cycle of poverty and poor quality of life.
Infrastructural deficiencies are also impacting the competitive advantage of Indian cities, with some of them falling behind in the global race to attract foreign investment. Investment in infrastructures is essential to improve the quality and availability of services, and to enable cities to meet the needs of their growing populations.

This study examines the impact of infrastructure investment on economic development in the Indian context. We use the data on state-level infrastructural development and the state level Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the period 1990–2012. The study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to test the long-run and short-term relationships between the infrastruture development expenditure and GSDPM. Our empircal results indicate that infrastrutural investments have a positive and significant impact on the economic performance of the states.

This is because the benefits of such facilities are more likely to accrue to the rural population than to urban populations, which are better served by existing facilities.

Estimates of the equitable cost to society of capital investments in regulation-constrained infrastructures have been used by governments to inform the design of infrastruture policies and regulations. We estimate the pre-tax cost-of-equity (COE) for investment in the electricity and natural gas securities markets in emerging economies. In addition to traditional determinants of COE, we include the impact of investor perceptions of market risk and government policy risk. Using the implied volatility of stock returns and a model of government risk, our estimates of pretax COEs are 15.7% for electric utilities and 9.5% to 8.8% (depending on the level of risk) in natural-gas distribution companies.

India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Urbanisation is a major factor in this growth. Infrastructure has a direct impact on the growth of urbanisation. However, the relationship between urban infrastructural development and urban population growth is not well understood. This study investigates the impact of infrastruture on urban growth in India. The study uses a panel data set of 285 towns and cities for the period 1991 to 93. We find that infrastrucuture has an impact in reducing the population-growth rate of a town or city. It is found that the effect of physical infrastrcuteure is more pronounced than that of social infrastrcture.

Infrastructure management is an emerging field in developing countries. In India, the management of infrastructures is a complex and challenging task, due to the vastness of the country, its diverse and complex needs, and the lack of adequate resources and infrastruc-ture. The development of a generic framework for the training and development in infrastru-cture management in the Indian context is the main objective of this paper. This paper is based on the findings of an extensive literature review and a series of interviews with key stakeholders in this area.

This paper investigates the profit efficiency of three real sector industries, namely, real estates, infrastructural and industrial sectors in India. The data of 30 firmed listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) were used for the analysis. For the estimation of the model, the data were divided into three equal time periods of five years each. To examine the efficiency, two different methods, viz. data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis were employed. DEA is a non-parametric method of measuring efficiency and it provides a relative measure of efficiency. Stochastic frontiers analysis is an efficient method for measur­ing efficiency with respect to a set of inputs and outputs. It is also a parametric approach.
The study reveals that real-estate, infra­structural,",108,199,0.5380116959064327,7.035415838697228,0.8794407738581683,0.05398989527154142,0.84,0.8492517006802719,0.7760288598944747,53.826280623608014,48.93567251461988,44.17676575203252

The Investment in infrastructure is a critical component of a nation’s development. It is the backbone of any economy and is critical to economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. India has been facing a significant infrastructural gap in the past few decades. The lack of adequate infrastruc-ture has resulted in poor economic performance, low productivity, high costs, inefficiency, poor living standards, environmental degradation, etc.
Infrastructures are essential to the economic and social well-being of the people. They are the building blocks of economic development and are necessary to support the growth of industries and businesses. In addition, infrastru-ctures play a vital role in promoting social welfare and human development by providing access to essential services such as education, healthcare, transportation and communication.

We estimate the impact of the Indian Golden quadriliteral (GQ) highway on households in the state of Tamil Nadu. The GQ is a 2300 km highway that connects the four largest cities in India. We use a difference-in-differences approach to estimate how the Gq has affected households' incomes. Our results show that the highway has increased household income by 4%-6% in rural areas and 3% to 5% for households living in urban areas.

The Indian automobile industry is on the cusp of a revolution. In the next few years, the number of electric cars on Indian roads will increase significantly, as will the need to install chargers at homes, offices, and other locations.
However, there are many challenging issues that need addressing before the market can fully develop. These include:
Infrastructure – There is a lack of infrastructural support for EVs in India. This includes chargering stations, which are not widely available. Furthermore, these chargring stations are often located in remote areas that are difficult to reach. As a result, Evs are unable to charge at these stations. Additionally, many EVS have no way to recharge themselves at home or work, making them less attractive as a long-term solution for transportation needs.

This paper examines the impact of the Vision Ahead Infrastructure Fund (VAIC), a private equity (PE) fund, on the financial performance of infrastructural companies in the Indian economy. The paper investigates the performance and valuation of 15 infrastruc-tural firings during the period 2006 to 30 June 6, 013. Using the panel methodology, we find that VICA affects the overall performance, profitabil-ity and market valuations of these firgs. We find a positive effect of VAC on profit-ability, with the most significant effect in 410. However, the effect on market value is negative.

Public expenditures on infrastructure in India have increased significantly in recent years, as have the efforts to improve their efficiency and accountability. However, these efforts have not been accompanied by an increase in the public expenses on these projects, and the gap between public and private investments remains wide.
Infrastructural development is a key to India's economic growth and social development. The Indian economy has grown at an average rate of 7.2 percent in 1991-21, but the country has not yet been able to achieve the target of providing basic infrastructures to all its citizens. In 50 years since independence, India has spent about US$ 40 billion on public infrastruc- ture. This is about 0.7 percent of GDP in a year, compared to 3.5 percent for China. About 95 per cent of this expendi-",129,191,0.5963855421686747,7.683890204492695,0.8988910068605385,0.04554237412319962,0.9333333333333332,0.9169014084507039,0.8208171404643333,79.88438438438439,76.1867469879518,73.46116225546606

The Indian infrastructural sector has been growing at a rapid pace, driven by the country’s economic growth. Infrastructure is the backbone of any economy and it is critical for the growth of the economy. It is also the source of employment and income generation for a large number of people. The infrastruc-ture sector contributes significantly to the GDP and the employ-ment generation in the sector is higher than the average for other sectors.
There is a need to focus on the development of infrastru-cture as it will help in improving the quality of life of citizens and will also help to improve the economic conditions of a country. However, there are certain challenges that need be addressed in order to achieve this goal. One of these challeng-es is that the funding for infrastruce development is not sufficient and this is leading to a lack of investment in this sector. Another challenge is lack o f coordination between",132,197,0.5157894736842106,7.109667251078115,0.8738224592864676,0.05537129624755084,0.8457142857142858,0.8373493975903613,0.7561410119378185,45.26810213178054,49.09473684210526,42.83965138347817

The purpose of this paper is to examine the supply chain practices and the extent of their implementation in the Indian manufacturing sector.
Data are collected from 128 manufacturers in India using a questionnaire survey. The responses are analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. A factor analysis is used to identify the dimensions of supply management. Factor scores are calculated for each manufacturer and then the average scores for the manufactures are compared with the scores of the global manufacture. An analysis of variance is also conducted to compare the performance of manufactuers with different levels of implementation of SCM. Finally, the results are discussed in terms of implications for Indian firms.",134,188,0.5390070921985816,6.400354600105544,0.8751148643737069,0.05810721433237039,0.8399999999999999,0.8126495726495733,0.745725114426709,42.0836820083682,44.794326241134755,38.01062955132723

The report also suggests that the government should create a separate fund to finance the development of smart cities. These proposals will be discussed in the Union Budget for 2018-19. NITIAyog has also proposed that states should be given a freedom to design their own policy on land acquisition and compensation.

Indian manufacturers are facing a severe crisis of competitiveness. The industry has not been able to maintain its growth momentum, which has been stagnant for the last four years. In this context, the role of state infrastructural development in improving the performance of the manufacture sector is important. This paper examines the impact of infrastruc-tural services on the productivity of Indian industrial units. It also estimates the returns to scale and the level of capital intensity of manufactu-ring units in India. We find that the infrastructoral services have a positive and significant impact on productiv-ity, while the capital intensities are high.

Infrastructural Development in India
India's infrastructures are in the process of rapid change and expansion. In the last few years, the country has witnessed an unprecedented growth in its infrastruture sector.
The development of the infrastrucuture has a direct impact on the economic development and growth of a country. The infrastruure sector includes all the facilities and services which are essential for the functioning of an economy. It includes transport, telecommunications, energy, water, sanitation, housing, electricity, roads, bridges, tunnels, dams, sewage treatment, and solid waste management. All these facilities are required to ensure that people, goods, services, information and capital are able to move efficiently",138,182,0.5490196078431373,6.790997501017324,0.880801406971116,0.05456083698935695,0.7466666666666666,0.773023255813954,0.7525438560078387,30.78980948161276,31.33986928104575,29.3531512605042

In India, the private sector plays an important role in the provision of primary education. However, there is a lack of research on the relative performance of private and government schools. This paper assesses the performance and costs of government and private schools, and compares the physical conditions of these schools with those of the public schools of similar economic status. The analysis is based on a sample of 2,217 schools from the 64th round of India's National Sample Survey. We find that private-sector schools are generally better equipped than government-run schools and are more likely to be located in urban areas. On average, government primary school teachers are less educated than their private counterparts. Private schools also tend to have higher teacher-student ratios, which may be explained by the fact that government school students are not required to pay fees",148,188,0.5268817204301075,7.185708636046312,0.8773803563295735,0.0540290567554713,0.8457142857142858,0.8365432098765424,0.764468600834687,52.34426229508197,50.575268817204304,47.26855686524371

Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 55, No.36 (Sep 2021): 47-54.
This article provides evidence on the effectiveness of payments interventions in delivering public benefits. We study the impact of biometrics-enabled smart cards, which were rolled out to provide cash transfers to over 600 million Indian citizens in 12 states. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that the rollout of smart card pay-ments reduced the incidence of corruption in the program, increased the quality of the service provided, and improved the accuracy of benefit delivery. In addition, the introduction of crypto-graphic signatures improved program efficiency, reducing the time taken to deliver benefits and improving the timeliness of benefits to beneficiaries. The findings suggest that investments in payme-nt",149,191,0.58125,7.352295559891481,0.8930924650399242,0.048503500626700974,0.8733333333333332,0.8750000000000008,0.7774547368447993,53.333333333333336,64.2375,52.353846153846156

The impacts of social infrastructures on economic and social development are widely debated. However, little is known about how the provision of these services affects inequality in developing countries. This paper addresses this gap by estimating the impact on income inequality of the introduction of a large-scale infrastruture program in rural India. The results show that the program had a significant impact in reducing income and asset inequality, but the effect was not permanent. Income and wealth inequality increased again after the end of program.

The Aadhar project is an ambitious project to provide every Indian citizen with a unique 12-digit identification number. This number is to be linked to the citizenn’s bank accounts, PAN card, mobile phone number, and so on.

This paper investigates the impact of private and public investments on growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India using a cointegration approach. The study is conducted for the period 1980-2009. Using a panel of 29 states in the country, the study finds that public infrastructural invest- ment and its components have a positive impact on GDP growth. However, private invest­ ment in infrastruc- ture has a negative impact. This may be due to the fact that private sector investors are more interested in profits rather than social benefits.

In order to achieve these targets, the government will need to increase investment in urban services. Current investments are insufficient to meet the target. Even with the high rate at which urban population is growing, investing in infrastructural development is likely to remain a challenge.

This study examines the long-run relationship among transport infrastructural development, economic development and energy use in the Indian economy. The study is based on the time series data for the period 1980–2016. We find that transport development has a significant positive relationship with economic and infrastruc­tural developments and also a positive impact on energy demand. Further, we find evidence of the existence of long run relationship between transport, infrastru­ctural and econ­omic development. However, the causal relationship is found to be bi-directional between energy and transport and between economic develop­ment and both transportation and in­frastructu ral development in Indian econo­my.

A new report by the OECD examines the role of public finance in urban development and infrastructures in five emerging countries: Brazil; China; India; Poland; and, SouthAfrica.
The report finds that the fiscus is a key factor in determining the quality of urban life and the competitiveness of cities. However, public spending on infrastruture in cities has not kept pace with the rapid urbanisation of recent decades. This has resulted in the deterioration of basic urban services, and in infrastrutures that are often inadequate and unreliable. Public speding on urban transport is particularly low.

This paper assesses the role of infrastructure on firm productivities in the context of Indian economic growth. It is based on a novel data set that allows to exploit the large variation in infrastructural quality across Indian states. The results show that the impact of the quality of roads and electricity is positive and significant, while the effects of telecommunication infrastruc-ture are mixed. These results are robust to a battery of robustness checks. In addition, the analysis shows that these",170,197,0.589041095890411,7.117410641980364,0.8937999393552849,0.04906781274637608,0.8720000000000001,0.873114754098361,0.791082894799226,61.233933871747084,63.02739726027397,61.331862745098036

The eco-efficiency of the transport sector has been widely investigated in the literature, but less is known about the impacts of investment in transportation infrastructures on ecosystems. This study examines the relationship between transport expansions and the country's ecopolitical performance in terms of ecology. The analysis is based on a panel data set of 20 Indian states for the period 1991-2102. A two-stage least squares (2SLS) method is used to estimate the long-run impact on India' s ef foot print. It is found that transport investments in roads and railways increase the state' e foot prints, while the invest- ments in airports reduce the states' foot- prints. Moreover, the results indicate that the growth rate of road and railway expan- sions in a state is negatively related to the level of per",171,198,0.5964912280701754,7.8001349515991,0.8995090329150515,0.04500275061710725,0.88,0.8843537414965981,0.7934778805185345,72.8090644820296,69.90643274853801,70.63099236641222

Infrastructural development is a major challenge for many developing countries. This paper examines the relationship between infrastructure development and the economic growth of developing economies using data from 122 countries over the period 2003-2101. The results show that infrastructures have a positive effect on economic performance. In addition, the paper shows that there is an inverse relationship (negative) between the rate of economic progress and infrastrucutural deficiencies.

Improved access and equity in water supplies and water-related sanitary facilities is one of the most important development challenges in India. The Government of India has set an ambitious target of providing 24x7 water to all by 31st March 1997. However, the 60th round of National Sample Survey (NSS) data shows that the coverage of piped water connections in Indian cities has declined from 40% in 500 urban areas in the year 91-92 to 7% of urban households in year2011.
The Government has taken some measures to improve access. It has encouraged private sector participation in providing water services.

Background: Immunization is one of the most important health interventions in the child health care program. Despite of large-scale immune coverage, the problem of low immunity is still persisting in many districts of India.
Objective: To identify the district-wise variations and factors associated with immuno-coverage in children in a developing country like India using district level data. The study also aims to identify factors responsible for such variations. A secondary objective of this study is to compare the immuna-covers of districts with different levels of development in terms of their so-cioeconmic development. To do this, we have also included the districts on the basis of different soceconomic indicators. This study will be helpful in identifying the factors that are responsible in achieving the desired level of immuni-zation coverage.

Indian infrastructure,Sources of infrastructure finance,"Sources of infrastructure finance for the poor: An assessment of the potential for public-private partnerships
The infrastructural needs of developing countries are enormous. The private sector is an important source of finances for infrastruture, but it has been reluctant to invest in projects with high risks and low returns. This paper examines the possibility of using public private partnership (PPP) to attract private financse. It reviews the literature on PPPs and concludes that they can be an effective way of financing infrastrucutre projects in developing countrie. PPPS can help reduce the risky of investment in infrastrcture, and they may also help to reduce transaction costs. However, PPCs are not without their problems. They can lead to corruption and can also be expensive.

This dissertations aims to examine the impact infrastructural provision on the distribution of income in rural India. The study is based on a dataset of 193 rural villages from 25 districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, collected in 3 waves in between 6 months. Using a combination of fixed effects and two stage least squares regression, the study shows that infrastrructural investments have a positive impact on income distribution in villages, and this impact increases as the village’s level development increases.
The findings have important policy implications.

N2 - This paper investigates the underpriced issue of initial public offerings (IPOs) of Indian infrastructural companies during 2006-2102. We find that the IPO underperformance of the infrastrural firms is not explained by the conventional factors such as under-pricings, underwritings and over-allotments. However, we find the performance of these firmes to be related to the extent of foreign participation in the issue. This finding is consistent with the theory of agency cost. Further, the findings are robust to different specifications of sample and control variables. Thus, our study suggests that foreign investors may be more concerned about the governance structure of firme and hence, they are likely to avoid investing in firmed with poor governanace.

India has a long history of using canals for irigation. In fact, the first canal system was built in 2600 BCE. The first irriga­tion canal in the modern sense was the Ghaggar-Hakra canal, built by the Mughals in Punjab in about 1545. It was a 65 km-long canal. Most of these can­als were built to provide irri­gation for the cultivation of rice. They were, therefore, called ‘rice cana­ls’. Some of them were also used for navigation. During the British period, some of those can-als became important links in a network of canalisations that were to form the basis of modern canal sys­",183,191,0.5222929936305732,6.544312452634502,0.8715397583327517,0.058500051004747915,0.8066666666666666,0.8051127819548873,0.7260507931878808,43.39429624102229,38.87898089171974,33.26043208049719

Infrastructure projects have been the most important area of public-private partnership (P3) in the last decade. The main objective of this study is to explore the determinant of the profitability of PPP projects in India. For this purpose, the authors use a sample of 100 P3 projects and apply the stochastic frontier model (SFM) to assess the efficiency of these projects. In addition, they use the Tobit model to identify the factors that explain the variations in profit margins. According to the results, PPPS have a significant positive effect on efficiency. They also find that the project size, project type and the state in which the PPS is located are the main factors affecting the performance of a PSP.

Bicycles are a popular mode of transportation in many developing countries, but their use is often limited due to the lack of safe and convenient infrastructures. The present study is an attempt to quantify the effect of provision of infrastruture on the biking behavior. A case study of 1200 bikes and 40,025 biker days was conducted in the city of Bangalore, India. Bikers were interviewed on their baking habits and the availability of the infrastrcuture was measured on a scale of one to five. It was found that the number of days biciked increased by 70% when infrastrcture rating increased from 3 to 5. In addition, bikiing habbit was also found to be positively correlated with age, income, and education level.

The financing of infrastructural projects in India is a matter of concern. The share of public investment in GDP has declined significantly, while private investments in infrastruc-ture are not sufficient to meet the growing demand for infrastru-cture. This is because of the low level of private sector finan-cing.

The Middle Eastern and Northern African (MENA) region is one of the fastest growing regions in terms of infrastructural development, which is mainly driven by public-private partnership (PPP) projects. In the MENAs, PPPs are a key tool for the governments to deliver infrastruc- ture projects on time and on budget. However, the success of P3s in Mena is still a matter of debate. This paper aims to provide an overview of M&E methodologies used in PPs and discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying these methodolo- gies in projects in this region.

We use the Indian state-level panel data for the period 1980-13 to test the hypothesis that infrastructure development stimulates economic growth in rural areas. The results show that the positive effects of infrastructural investment on economic development are stronger in states with better initial conditions. Investment in infrastruc-ture is found to have a strong positive effect on the output growth of agriculture, but its effect is not statistically significant on other sectors.

The study was carried out to assess the infrastructure, use and challenging issues of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in University libraries in Rajsthan. A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from 119 University library professionals of 33 universities in 2014-15. Majority of libraries have internet connection, computers and e-resources. However, there is a lack of facilities like ILL, CD/DVD, scanners and printers. Lack of trained staff, budget, and awareness of library users are the main issues. In spite of all these challengings, libraries are trying their best to provide ITC services to their users.

This paper examines the perceptual and political impacts of infrastructural development on the local communities of Arunchal, a border state in northeast India. The paper focuses on two large infrastruc-tural projects along India's border with China: a hydroelectric dam on river Siang and a highway to connect the capital, Itanagar, with the Chinese border. It draws on interviews with local residents and officials to explore how the communities understand and respond to these projects. In particular, the paper looks at the political and economic benefits of the projects, as well as the social and environmental costs. I find that the residents are concerned about the economic and social impact of these large-scale projects and have begun to question the benefits that have been promised by the government.

Infrastructure managers and their staff face a range of challenges, including how to motivated staff to work effectively. The case studies in this report are based on research in two countries, India, and South Korea, which have very different approaches to infrastructural management. This report explores how these two approaches have influenced the motivation of staff.
The report finds that staff motivations are complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors. These include organisational culture, management style, financial incentives, the work environment, personal relationships, career development opportunities and work-life balance. It is important to recognise that different staff will be motivating by different factors, so it is essential to understand the range and complexity of motivators. In addition, different motivational approaches may be effective for different tasks or roles. For example, in a role that requires a high level of creativity, a more flexible approach to management may lead to better outcomes",199,198,0.5181347150259067,7.198157507486946,0.8750600967727462,0.05466496190440912,0.8285714285714285,0.860355029585799,0.7872559331261892,55.448890036138366,57.9119170984456,53.16788526434196

Indian Heritage Infrastructure (IHI) is a unique and diverse group of structures and buildings, which are the part of the cultural heritages of India. These structures are built using various construction materials like stone, wood, brick, concrete, and steel. However, these structures have been facing various issues like deterioration, damage, decay, etc. In this paper, an integrated crowdfunding framework is proposed for the digitalizing of IHI. The framework has been designed using the concept of Deep Learning (DL) and Crowdsensing (CS). The proposed framework consists of three major components: (1) Data acquisition and pre-processing, (2) Deep learning based model training, validation, testing, deployment and evaluation, with (3) Crowdfounding and crowdbasing.

Transport infrastructural investment plays a significant role in economic development. This paper revisits the empirics of the growth-transport infrastruc-ture relationship in the context of India. Using the time series data for 1980–2010, the study finds that the transportation infrastru-cture investments have a positive and significant effect on economic activity. The study also finds the existence of an inverted-U shaped relationship. In addition, there is evidence of a non-linear relationship, which indicates that a higher level of transport invest-ment does not always result in higher economic output.

In the past decade, India’s urban population has grown by more than 150 million people, and the country’a urbanization rate is expected to continue to increase at a rate of 2.5% per year. In 30 years, more people will live in cities than the entire population of the United Kingdom. These trends are creating a growing need for housing, infrastructural services, transportation, water and sanitation, energy, waste management, public health, education, social services and other critical components of sustainable cities.
The Indian government is actively pursuing the development of smart cities as a means to address these challenges. To achieve this goal, it is critical to understand the complexities of urban development, including the interplay of economic, environmental and social factors.

In recent years, the governments across the world have been promoting the adaption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in their public service delivery. The Indian government is no exception. This paper attempts to explore the factors that influence m-Governance adoptions in Indian public sector. It uses a survey of 300 public employees in four states of India. Results indicate that the respondents are very positive about the benefits of mGov. However, there are some barriers to the implementation of mobile governance. Some of the key barrier includes lack of awareness, security and privacy concerns, and lack infrastructural facilities.

The paper presents a synthesized indicator to delineate regional differences in the process of railway development in India. It aims to understand the regional variation in railway connectivity in northeast states of India, which is a new emerging region in terms of development. The paper uses data from 2001 to 1991 and applies a two-step synthesis technique to create a composite index. Results show that the states are heterogeneous in their developmental trajectories. Meghalaya and Tripura are lagging behind in infrastructural development and are less connected to the national railway network. In contrast, Assams' railway system is well-connected and has the most efficient railway services in comparison with other states.

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure regulation and reallocations within industry: Theory and evidence from Indian firms,"Infrastructure regulation and reallocations within industry: Theory and evidence from Indian firms
Infrastructural quality is an important determinant of firm location and firm performance. This paper examines the impact of infrastructure quality on firm reallocation within industries. Using a new dataset of Indian manufacturing firMS, we find that firMs are more likely to relocate within the same industry when infrastructures are poorer. We find evidence that the reallocated firMMs tend to be smaller, and more productive. The results are robust to the use of a variety of alternative measures of industry infrastruture quality.

Economic growth and social progress are two sides of the same coin. This paper analyses the role of infrastructural development in achieving economic and human development goals. It studies the impact of economic infrastruture on economic growth, and the effect of social infrastrure on human capital formation. Using state level data for India, the paper finds that economic development is more dependent on the quality of physical infrastrucure, while human progress depends on social development. The paper also finds a positive and significant effect on growth from the provision of both social and economic infrastucture.

Cities are the engines of economic growth. But urbanisation is often accompanied by increased inequalities, as the poor are often forced to live in informal settlements, or slums. These settlement are located in areas with poor access to basic services, such as water and sanitation. In India, 70% of the urban population lives in slum settlement, and these areas are home to more than 35% the country's population. The government has committed to providing all slume dwellers with basic water services by 2030. However, the challenge is not only to provide water to slumes, but to do so in a way that does not disrupt the lives of people living there. This is where pop-ups can help. Pop ups are a new way of providing water, where the infrastructures is temporary, mobile and flexible.

Indian infrastructure,Total factor productivity and technical efficiency of Indian manufacturing: The role of infrastructure and information & communication technology,"Total factor productivity and technical efficiency of Indian manufacturing: The role of infrastructure and information & communication technology
Total factor Productivity (TFP) is a measure of technological progress in an economy. This paper examines the role played by infrastructural and ICT investments in TFP growth in the Indian economy using data for manufacture industries for the period 1990-91 to 2007-08. The study uses a Malmquist index approach to measure TPF and its decomposition into technical and allocative efficiency. A significant positive relationship between infrastruc-ture and TFPC is found. However, the impact of ITC is not significant. Investments made in infrastru-cture have helped increase the allocational efficiency in manufactur-ing.

This study aims to explore the influence of coastline dynamic response of the Gadkhali coast in Odissa (northeastern India) to the anthropo-genic impacts of sea-defence structures. The dynamic shifting of shores along the study area is assessed by employing a numerical model, which is a combination of a wave model and a morphological model. This study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the coast was divided into three parts, i.e., A, B and C, and the morphology of these parts was computed using a digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite images.

Cold chain is the most important link in the food supply chain. It is a system of temperature-controlled storage and transportation of food from the time of production to the point of consumption. In India, cold chain infrastructure is still in its infancy. This paper aims to study the cold storage infrastructural development in India and the challenges faced by the industry. The data for the study has been collected from secondary sources.
The paper finds that the development of cold stores in rural areas is very low, which is not conducive to increasing the market share of frozen food in retail. As a result, there is an urgent need to increase the number of refrigerated warehouses in order to meet the increasing demand for froze foods. Furthermore, the paper concludes that inadequate cold store infrastruc- ture is one of the major challengers to growth of retails sector in",240,193,0.5561797752808989,7.420363721059028,0.886783441557603,0.0503090793390739,0.8628571428571429,0.8631168831168825,0.760656280302725,56.55034396497811,57.03370786516854,51.56573512327353

The 2014 Indian general election was characterized by an unprecedented level of violence, with 1,250 people killed in political clashes. This article argues that the Indian state has failed to constrain the violence because it has deliberately left it unregulated by the law. In India, elective violence is not only a criminal activity but a legitimate political tool. It is a means of winning elections, and the state and political parties often benefit from it. The article compares electorally motivated violence with electively motivate violence.
Based on fieldwork in West Bengal and Odisha, the article demonstrates that electorial violence has a structural basis. Patrons and their followers use violence to win elections. They also use it to mobilize their voters and to intimidate opponents.

As the country's IT industry matures, it is becoming more difficult for companies to find the right people.

A report by global IT consultancy firm Zinnov has found that Indian companies are facing severe infrastructure challenges in the face of a rapidly growing IT sector. The report, titled India'S Innovation Imperative: A Call for Investment in Infrastucture, highlights the need for a more robust infrastructural base to support the growing industry. This is because of the increasing number of global companies that are looking to outsource their IT services to India. However, as the industry grows, there are concerns that it will face a shortage of skilled manpower. ""The IT-BPO industry in its current form is not sustainable,"" said Zinov CEO Sudhir Singh.

India is a country with a lot of untapped potential. It has a huge population, a large market, and a growing economy. However, there are some challenges that India faces when it comes to infrastructural development.
One of the biggest challenged faced by India is the lack of adequate infrastrucutre. This is especially true when we talk about the transportation sector. India has one ofthe largest road networks in the world, but it is still not enough to meet the needs of its population. The railways are also in dire need of improvement. There are many other areas where India needs to invest more in infrastruction. These include water and sanitation, energy, telecommunications, etc. In order to overcome these challengers, India need to attract more foreign investment.

A study of the physical infrastructures and the development in secondary sectors in six Indian states viz. Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu was carried out for the period 1971-72 to 2002-03. The study was undertaken to examine the trends in the growth of physical and human capital and their contribution to the secondary industries' growth in these states. It was found that the contribution of human and physical capital to secondary industry's growth has been decreasing in all the states except Assams, where it has remained almost constant. In all states the rate of growth and contribution in physical investment to industrial growth was higher than that of contribution from human investments.

Urban India is home to the world' s largest population of slum dwellers. In the city of Mumba i, where slums are concentrated in the eastern suburbs, the majority of the population is dependent on the informa l sector. Slums in this region are characterised by the presence of a high density of small scale industries and a large number of workers employed in them. The majority are migrants from rural areas of Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Gujarat, as well as from other states in India.

This paper examines the feasibility and benefits of applying the integrated project delivery (IPD) approach to infrastructural projects. The IP D approach is a collaborative project management method that is used to enhance the delivery of projects and increase the value of the built asset. It has been found that the IP approach has the potential to reduce costs and improve project outcomes. However, its implementation in infrastruc- ture projects is not without challenges. This paper investigates the challenging issues and the benefits associated with the implementation of IP in a developing country context. A case study was conducted to identify the issues that hinder the successful implementation and delivery in such countries and to determine the likely benefits that would result from the adoption of this approach.

Rainbowness is the most important quality of a rain bow. It is its most salient feature. Rainbowy is a good word to describe the phenomenon. However, it is also a word that is used to refer to a particular kind of thing. A rain-bow is an object. That is, a thing that can be seen from a distance. In this sense, rain bows can also be used as metonyms. For example, the word rain may be a metonymous term for a storm. This is because the storm is visible from the distance of the horizon.

Governments, development agencies and private sector entities are investing increasingly in the development of infrastructures to enhance the economic, social and political development and well-being of their citizens.
This has led to an increase in investment in construction projects and the need for improved project management and procurement practices. The increasing complexity of projects has resulted in delays, cost escalation and disputes. This has affected the timely completion of the projects, which in turn affects the wellbeings of citizens and economies. In addition, the delinquency in project completion and its impact on the economy has been increasing over the years. For instance, in 2007, it was estimated that the cost of delayed projects in India was 1.2% of GDP.

Indian infrastructure,Urban infrastructure financing and delivery in India and China,"Urban infrastructure financing and delivery in India and China: a comparative study
The rapid urbanisation of India has placed enormous pressure on urban infrastructures, including water, sanitation, energy, transport and urban housing. Infrastructure provision is a key challenge for the country’s urban development. The Indian government has initiated several programmes to address the issue of urban poverty and infrastruture provision, but there is an increasing need for a more holistic and integrated approach to urban planning and development, and a shift towards public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastrcture delivery.
China, on the other hand, has long been a leader in urban governance and has been at the forefront of infrastrucuture development for many years. Its experience is valuable for India, as it provides an opportunity to learn from China’’ successes and failures in order to improve infrastrcuture provision in Indian cities. However, the two countries face similar challenges in terms of finanacing urban",275,198,0.5681818181818182,7.53778361444409,0.8906652047288874,0.04869034890706825,0.8857142857142858,0.8965789473684205,0.7911362317480952,73.08314847395395,70.69886363636364,67.10698230511716

Green infrastructure is a network of natural and semi-natural areas and green spaces within and around urban areas. It includes green roofs, urban forests, green walls, rain gardens, wetlands, parks, and urban agriculture. The green infrastructures are not only important for the environment, but also for people’s well-being and economic development.
The European Commission has published the “Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe” in 2011, which defines a vision for a resource efficient Europe by 30% in GDP and by half in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 500.

The paper examines the long-run convergence and growth patterns across the Indian states using the time series data for the period 1980–2011. The study finds that the convergence is not uniform across all the states. While some states have experienced convergence in the past, others have not. It also finds out that there is a convergence of per capita income across states in India. However, the evidence of convergence depends upon the methodology of growth convergence used. There is evidence for convergence among the poorest states and for those states with higher per capital income. But, there are also states which have remained poor over the years.

The relative importance of the different factors of production in a country’s industrial sector is a subject of interest to many economists. This paper uses a panel data set of Indian state-level manufacturing industries for the period 1990–2005 to examine the relative contribution of three factors to industrial production: bank credit, the quality of infrastructural facilities and the labour force. The results show that the impact of labour is not significantly different from that of credit and infrastruc-ture. In addition, there is no evidence of a significant difference in the contribution made by the three types of factors in different industrial sectors.

In the Indian economy, entreprenurial activity is predominantly concentrated in the unorganized sector. This is because the regulatory framework in this sector is relatively more flexible, compared to the organized sector, and therefore more conducive to entreprenuership.
The unregulated nature of the sector allows the entreprener to enjoy greater freedom in setting up a business, as well as in its operations. However, this flexibility has its own costs, such as the absence of a legal framework for protecting the rights of consumers and the lack of access to institutional finance. Thus, the regulation of this activity has to be carefully balanced, to ensure that the benefits of unrestricted entreprneurship are not outweighed by its costs.",294,184,0.5588235294117647,6.516946235415335,0.8815464226605177,0.05551976431025923,0.8240000000000001,0.803928571428572,0.7393705099699888,44.54033771106942,45.330882352941174,42.397502774694786

This paper examines the role of rural infrastructural development in the socio-economic transformation of a rural area in AndraPradesh, India. The study focuses on the impact of developmental activities in Tirunallur, a village in Chittoor district. This paper uses a mixed method approach, including a survey of 184 households, in-depth interviews with 20 households and a review of relevant literature. Findings show that the development activities have resulted in a significant increase in income, improved health status and increased education. However, it is also found that some of these activities are not reaching the poorest households. In addition, some households are unable to benefit from the developments because of their geographical location. It is suggested that a more particip",296,192,0.5714285714285714,7.406560798180411,0.8907845975918441,0.049078752021136,0.8266666666666667,0.8588888888888887,0.7694888433208469,52.728971962616825,55.029761904761905,51.71129943502825

The use of geosynthetic cellular confinement systems (GCCS) to improve the performance of highway pavements is gaining popularity in the US and worldwide. Geocell systems have been successfully used in many applications such as roadway embankments, subbase and base layers, and subgrade improvement. In addition, they have also been used to enhance the load capacity of the existing pavement. However, the use and application of these systems are limited by the modulus of elasticity of traditional geogrids, which is typically less than 100 MPa. The use geofoam or lightweight geotextile is another option to increase the stiffness of GCC systems. This option, however, is not suitable for use in highway applications due to the weight and other issues.

Mumbadevi, an informal settlement in central Mumba, is one of the most densely populated slums in India. The settlement is home to approximately 40,00 people. A significant proportion of residents are daily wage labourers who live in poverty and struggle to provide for their families. Water is an essential part of life for all residents, but the settlement receives only a fraction of its water needs from the city’s water supply network.
The city of Mubai has failed to deliver adequate water to the slump, leaving residents to source their water from informally managed pipelines. This project will use a mixed-methods approach to explore how the lack of access to water infrastructures impacts the lives of people in the community. We will explore the role of legal and social exlusion in shaping access and use of water.

The Indian infrastructure sector is in dire need of automation to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve safety. However, many obstacles prevent the implementation of such automated systems in the country.
Automation has become a buzzword in recent years, with industries across the globe adopting it to increase efficiency and reduce errors. The Indian government has also been pushing for automating various processes in its infrastructural projects to achieve the same goals. But, despite the government's efforts, the adoption of this technology has been slow in India. This article will explore the reasons behind the slow adaption of technology in infrastrural project in india. We will discuss the challenges faced by the industry and how they can be overcome to make the transition to automate infrastrure projects in a smooth and efficient manner.

The Government of India has set a target of 20% of total energy requirements to be met by renewable energy sources by 30th June 17. This has resulted in a significant increase in the capacity of renewables in recent years. However, there is still a huge potential for solar power generation in Indian cities. In the absence of a robust grid, the only viable option to meet the increasing energy demand is to install decentralised solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The objective of this study is therefore to investigate the procurements of decentrilised renewal energy infrastructures in cities of the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, through a public private partnership (PPP) model.

The paper addresses the issue of how accessibility to infrastructural facilities affects the value of resident-ial plots in urban areas. The study was conducted in RajKot city in India, where the urban infrastru-ture is not adequate and the land is very expensive. A geographically weight-ed least squares model was used to estimate the effects of access to water, sewerage, electricity and road facilities on the values of the plots. In this model, the weights of plots were calculated based on their access distance to the infrastruc- ture facilities. It was found that the access distances of water and sewage infrastruture facilities to resident plots have a significant positive effect on resident plot values.

India has one of the lowest infrastructural development rates in the world. The country is facing an infrastrucutre deficit of over $1 trillion.
The Indian government is trying to address this issue by allocating over 30% of its budget to infrastruture development. However, this is not enough. In order to bridge the infrastrucre defict, India needs to invest more than $500 billion in infrastrcture over the next five years. This is where foreign exchnage resrves come in. Foreign exchange reerves can be used to fund infrastrure projects in India. There are a number of benefits to using foreign echange resves to fince infrastrcure. First, it will help to boost economic growth. Second, foreign currency reses will be able to help finace infrastrutcures that are not financed by the government.

Gig platforms like Uber, Ola, and Swiggy have transformed the way people work. In India, these platforms have been widely accepted by people from all walks of life, but especially by the urban poor, who are willing to work on these digital platforms for low wages.
The gig economy has been a boon for women workers, as they can work from the comfort of their homes and earn a living. But the gig platforms are not always as beneficial for the workers as it seems. They often face issues like low pay, long hours, no benefits, or even discrimination.

In the last decade, the government has been able to overcome some of the external challenge. However, it has not been successful in overcoming the internal challenge of governace. This has resulted in the failure of many government initiatives and programmes.

The manufacture of automobiles, which is the mainstay of Indian transportation, is also one the largest energy consumers, with a share of about one-third of India's total industrial energy use. A large proportion of this energy is consumed in the form of crude oil, mainly imported from the Middle East. India is thus exposed to the volatility of international oil prices and vulnerable to supply disruptions.

That’d be enough to turn anyone off of driving, but it turns out that cars and trucks aren’t the only problem. There’re other factors that contribute to the problem, too. For instance, the way we build roads can also have a major impact on the environment. In fact, if we built roads in a different way, we could significantly reduce the eco-footprint of our roads. And the best part is that it wouldn’ t cost us a dime more. That’ s right, it could even save us money. So what’ re we waiting for?

By Kaitlyn Van Dyk
Infrastructure is a major site of political and legal contestation. From the 1990s onward, international lawyers have focused on the relationship between infrastructural projects and human rights. In particular, they have drawn attention to the ways in which infrastruc­ture can facilitate or impede human mobility, access to health care, education, food, water, shelter, sanitation, or other basic human needs. Yet the international legal framework for infrastru­cture is limited. It does not provide a comprehensive or systematic approach to infrastruce. This is because the legal regime for the construction and operation of infrastruture is primarily shaped by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which focuses on market access and competition. As a result, the infrastrutre of transnational corporations and other actors",340,191,0.6289308176100629,7.930515857181441,0.9085139513922912,0.041558175758928395,0.8933333333333334,0.8779259259259254,0.8034451961766591,85.38912331768589,67.23899371069183,59.275

Cities have been the engines of economic growth in India since independence. The urban population of India increased from 17.3% in 2001 to 31.1% of the total population in the year 0210. This trend is expected to continue with the Indian government's vision of a 50% urbanization by 4030 and 70-80 % by the end of this century. In order to achieve the goal of sustainable development, it is necessary to improve the infrastructural facilities in cities. However, the provision of basic services in urban areas has been uneven and inadequate. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is still a major concern in Indian cities, with 64% and approximately 84.5% households respectively lacking access to these services.

Public private participation in infrastructures is the buzz word of the day. Public Private Partnership (PPP) has been hailed as a panacea for the infrastrucutre deficit in the country. PPP has also been projected as the way forward to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of infrastru-tures in developing countries. In India, the PP model has already been adopted in a big way in road sector. The Ppp model is also being considered for other sectors like water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, health, education, urban transport, irrigation and flood control. This paper analyses the growth of Pp in india'S infrastrutures. It also discusses various aspects of public private sector partnerships.

The growing imperative for sustainable urban development has prompted the adoption of green measures in cities across the globe. This has led to a proliferation of approaches to the conceptualization and implementation of these measures, including green networks, green roofs, permeable pavements, and urban forests. The adverse effects of climate change on the urban environment have also made cities vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as floods and heatwaves, which in turn have led governments to adopt green strategies to improve the resilience of cities. However, the increasing adaption of such measures has also led some to question their effect",356,180,0.5986842105263158,7.381074661449696,0.8978835160986257,0.046802843460270555,0.86,0.8624999999999995,0.7742318451769045,52.53787878787879,61.07236842105263,50.20253164556962

Indian infrastructure,Economic Infrastructure in Northeast India: An Analysis,"Economic Infrastructure in Northeast India: An Analysis of the Current Status and the Way Forward
The northeast region of India is the most underdeveloped part of Indian economy. It is a home to a large number of tribal population, who are living in a very backward condition. The region is endowed with rich natural resources but has failed to make the best use of them. Lack of infrastructure has been the main reason for the underdevelopment of this region.
Agriculture in India has grown at a rate of 2.9 per cent during 1990-2005. However, it is still not sufficient to meet the growing demand for food grains in the country. This is because the rate at which agricultural production has increased is not commensurate with the population growth. To meet this growing need for agriculture, the government has taken several steps to increase the production of agricultur...

This paper examines the relationship between healthcare facilities and contraception use in India. It uses data from 49,066 households in 5,646 villages from U.P. state, which is India’s largest state. The data shows that the availability of health facilities in a village has a significant impact on the probability of using contractions. Women in villages with more health care facilities are more likely to use contraction methods than women in other villages. This is true even after controlling for caste, age, literacy, and other factors.
The findings of this study indicate that women who have access to health services are better able to",360,183,0.5958904109589042,7.200171230840601,0.8961197096097664,0.04799600495483152,0.8959999999999999,0.8665573770491806,0.807811429897147,55.937964176496294,67.18493150684931,52.08738492520138

The paper examines the impact of infrastructure investment on economic
growth in India using a panel data approach. The empirical analysis is
based on a data set covering 1990-2004. A panel cointegration analysis
establishes a long-run equilibrium relationship between infrastructural
investments and GDP growth. It is found that the long run elasticity of
GDP with respect to infrastrucure investments is 0.75. There is a
significant impact on Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) of investing in

Infrastructural development is a key component of economic growth, with roads and railways playing a central role in the transport system. This paper examines the impact of infrastructures on economic development in India. The study uses a data set of 210 districts in 1990-2007 to analyse the role of transport infrastructure in economic performance. We find that district level economic output increases with the provision of roads. However, we also find a negative relationship between the growth of district output and the availability of rail links.

The present paper examines the resource requirements of urban infrastructural development and the means of mobilizing the same. The paper analyses the financial requirements for urban infra-structure development, the sources of financing and methods of resource mobilisation. It is observed that urban development is a multi-sectoral activity and hence, requires a wide range of resources. These resources can be broadly categorised into physical, financial, human and natural resources, which are required in varying degrees for different types of infrastruc-ture projects. Financial resources are the most important of these resources and constitute about 80-90 per cent of the total cost of development projects in urban areas. Urban infractructural projects are funded mainly through the public sector, but the share of private sector participation has been increasing in recent years.

The Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, with a GDP growth rate of 7.5 per cent in 2014-15. This growth has been driven by the private sector, which has led the way in infrastructure investment. However, the pace of infrastructural development has not kept pace with the country's economic growth.

Indian infrastructure,"Regional disparity, infrastructure development and economic growth: An inter-state analysis","Regional disparity, infrastructure development and economic growth: An inter-state analysis
The paper investigates the relationship between infrastructural development, regional disparities and growth in India. The paper has used a panel data of 29 states for the period 1991-2012. A probit model is employed to estimate the probability of growth for each state. Infrastructure is measured by road density and electricity access. Regional development is captured by the Gini coefficient of per capita consumption. It is found that the states that have a high level of infrastrutural developments have high probability to grow. Further, the infrastruture and regional development are found to have an inverse relationship.

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure development in India,"Infrastructure development in India has always been a key focus of the government. In 2014, the Modi government set the goal of constructing 100 smart cities in the country. However, this has not been achieved yet.
According to the Smart Cities Mission, as of January 31, 54 smart city projects have been approved, and 48 projects are under implementation. The remaining 84 projects remain to be approved. Additionally, only 64 cities have submitted their detailed project reports (DPRs) to secure funding for the project. This means that only a fraction of these projects will be completed in time. As of February 7, five cities – Indore, Visakhapatnam, Surat, Pune, Ahmedabad – have completed their projects. While the other 99 cities are still struggling to get their DPR approved and funded.

This paper analyses the role of public infrastructural investments in influencing regional growth. The paper argues that the spatial pattern of invest-ment decisions of the government in public projects is influenced by the location of private fir-matic activities. In turn, this location choice is also influenced in part by publicly funded infrastruc-tural projects. Therefore, a dynamic model of regional investm ent and location is developed and estimated for the Indian states. Using a panel of 18 Indian States over the period 2004-210, we find that place-specific public in-vestments have a positive impact on regional economic growth, and this effect is stronger in the short-run. We also find a strong positive relationship between the public project invest",382,183,0.5266272189349113,6.846153846153846,0.8749951254738273,0.0561091703035452,0.8733333333333334,0.8708965517241376,0.773274991547301,56.333333333333336,53.98816568047337,53.4002597757725

This paper studies the relationship between infrastructural development and the size of agro-industrial clusters in India. It is argued that the presence of a large cluster in a district can attract the establishment of more infrastruc-tural facilities in the district, which in turn can lead to an increase in population. The paper uses a unique dataset on the agri-business clusters and infrastru-ctural status in 543 districts in six states in northern India during 4 years. In order to control for the endogeneity of the infrastrutural investment, the paper estimates a two-stage least squares model.

The paper analyses the linkages between infrastructural development and economic growth in India. It is argued that the impact of infrastruture on economic activity is not uniform across regions and that it depends on the type of region. The paper uses a regional panel data set for India for the period 1980-1890. A cross-sectional regression model is estimated to examine the relationship between the infrastrucure and output. This is followed by a panel regression to determine the causality between these variables.

The transport sector is one of those industries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The transport industry is also one that contributes significantly to climate impact, which is a major concern in today’s world. This study aims to explore the impact of circularity on the transport system and the stakes of different actors in such a system. A multi-criteria analysis is used to evaluate the change in social indicators due to transition to a circular system in India. It is found that circular transport infrastructures are beneficial to all the three stakholding groups—society, government, and business.

The Indian financial system is undergoing a digital revolution. In this paper, we study the effects of digitalisation on the financial sector. We use the Indian data on banks, mobile network operators, and credit bureaus, to construct a database of financial transactions. Our analysis shows that there is a close relationship between the growth of the digital economy and the performance of banks and mobile operators. The data also shows a strong link between digital transactions and financial inclusion. This paper also provides evidence on how the credit information of borrowers is improving over time.

Indian infrastructure,A comparison of India and China's foreign investment strategy toward energy infrastructure,"A comparison of India and China's foreign investment strategy toward energy infrastructure in Southeast Asia
China and India are increasing their investments in energy-related infrastructures in the Sino-Indian periphery. China has been the largest foreign direct investor in this region since 2004, while India'S investors have been more selective and have not been able to catch up with China. The main difference between the two countries is the use of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as the vehicle for their foreign operations. This paper argues that the SOE-based investing strategy of China is a major reason for its success in attracting foreign energy investm ent in its peripheral region. It is also argued that India, with its private sector-led invest m ent strategy, is less likely to be successful in capturing a large share of foreign inves m en t in infrastruc tures.

Infrastructure development is an integral part of the government’s agenda for economic growth and development. Infrastructural development in the transport sector is necessary to provide the necessary infrastructures to facilitate the movement of people and goods across the country. The government has made infrastruc- ture development a priority area and has taken various initiatives to encourage private participation in infrastru- cture projects.

Indian infrastructure,Resetting PPP in infrastructure model in india post-COVID-19 pandemic,"Resetting PPP in infrastructure model in india post-COVID-19 pandemic
The pan-India lockdown in response to the COVID- 1 9 has brought the country’s economic activity to a virtual standstill. The impact of the lock-down has been severe on the construction sector. According to an estimate, the sector is likely to lose about 20 per cent of its workforce in the next three months. This will affect the capacity of infrastructural projects in urban and rural areas.
As the panic over the spread of COVID -1-9 recedes, it is time to rethink the role of public-private partnership (PPP) in financing infrastruc-tural development in India. PP P is a contractual arrangement between a public authority and a private entity, whereby the private partner provides infrastru-ctural assets and services for a specified period of time in return for the payment of a fee",401,184,0.6227544910179641,8.047761618355024,0.907463171970553,0.041632313086549626,0.88,0.8682517482517487,0.7986460806953801,73.92431192660551,74.0,76.17117117117118

The role of infrastructure in growth has been a subject of debate for several decades. The issue has gained greater importance in the recent past due to the poor performance of the economy. India has witnessed a slowdown in economic growth in recent years. This has led to a decline in investment and a fall in industrial production. It is widely believed that the slow growth of investments is due, in part, to inadequate infrastructural facilities.
Infrastructures play a crucial role in development. They are necessary for the efficient functioning of economic activities. A sound infrastrucure system is important for growth. Investment in infrastruture is an important factor for economic development and growth and is often considered a pre-requisite for a country to achieve higher levels of development, and economic prosperity. Thus, the development of a sound and efficient infrastrutural system has become a major concern of",402,191,0.48255813953488375,6.328690668803094,0.8584449439821592,0.06332062390601952,0.84,0.8289189189189191,0.7261278119953785,44.734866329433274,42.81976744186046,41.63526130358191

The public–public partnerships (PPPs) are the preferred option of governments in developing infrastructural projects. However, the PPP model has been found to be ineffective in the case of developing countries due to lack of capacity, political and bureaucratic interference, and poor project management. The public-private-partnership (P3) model is considered to overcome the problems of PP model. In India, a number of infrastruc-ture projects have been developed through P3.

Knowledge Management (KM) is a key component of Knowl-edge Infrastructure (IKI). This paper reports the findings of a study that investigated the influence of KM on the effectiveness of IKI. The study was conducted in a public-sector undertak-ing (PSU) in India. It was found that the ICI was effective in the PSU. However, the KMC was not effective. There were several reasons for this. First, there was no formal KMP in place. Second, no KPM was developed. Third, KMA was ineffective. Fourth, a KMS was absent. Fifth and finally, an IKS was non-existent. In conclusion, it is suggested that KI should be viewed as a complex system.

This paper explores the ways in which infrastructural development is imagined and contested in the Indian state of Mani pur. In Man i pur, the state has embarked on an ambitious programme of road construction, which has been accompanied by a range of other development initiatives. However, in many areas of the region, these infrastruc tural developments have been met with resistance. This paper examines the politics and poeti cs of these resistances, and the way in whi ch they are articulated in terms of alternative futures. It argues that the resis tance to infrastru ctural projects is not simply a rejection of development, but rather the arti culation of an alternative vision of what development means.

Presented at the 3rd International Conference on Water in the Anthropocene, 2017
This paper explores the every day water practices of households in an Indian town, where water is provided by a complex arrangement of private and public actors. We argue that the ways in which water flows through the town are not only a result of the physical infrastructures, but also of every-day practices. These practices are negotiated through interactions among the actors in different social and institutional spaces. Drawing on ethnographic material, we identify three different practices through which households access water: (1) a practice of self-reliance; (2) the practice to obtain water from a neighbour; and (3) buying water at a water kiosk.",412,180,0.5536723163841808,7.366131074427723,0.8857872580109284,0.05080698409457388,0.8914285714285715,0.893856209150326,0.8009566961820657,54.712209302325576,67.12429378531074,67.24268052184466

Abstract: Infrastructure is an important factor for economic development and prosperous lives. Investment in infrastructures is a key driver of economic growth in the developing world. The literature has emphasized the role infrastruc-tures play in poverty reduction and economic prosper-ity. However, the literature on infrastru-ctures has not paid attention to the environmental impact of development. This paper provides a framework to analyse the trade-off between economic and environ-mental outcomes of investments in in-frastructural projects. We consider a general model of the economic environment of a developing country and the impacts of various types of infra-structure investment on economic welfare. Our analysis shows that the benefits of infras-tructure invest-ments are not uniform and that",420,200,0.5588235294117647,7.286167394050018,0.8866930716650269,0.050800055203665796,0.86,0.8608219178082189,0.7727547323133138,52.67042783262811,56.05882352941177,54.21757703081232

In India, the share of urban population living in informal settlements has increased from 33% in 1991 to 45% of total urban residents in the 2001 census. The Government of India has recognized the need for slum upgradation and has launched several schemes to address the problems of inadequacy of services and insecurity of tenure in urban areas. However, there is little evidence on the extent to which these schemes have been effective in improving the quality of life in these areas and the incentives for households to move to these slummy areas or to upgrade their living conditions.

Infrastructure development is a complex and multidimensional process. It is characterised by a number of actors with different agendas, interests and perspectives. Infrastructural planning in developing countries is often characterized by weak institutional arrangements and limited public participation. This paper examines the role of different actors in the hydraulic infrastructures planning process in two Indian states. The study is based on the case studies of two hydel projects, viz. Teesta-IV and Karcham-Wangtoo.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was created in 1966 to finance development projects in the Asia and Pacific region. The China-led Asian infrastructure investment bank (AIIB), which was established in December 2015, is the newest multilateral development bank. Its main goal is to provide infrastructural development financing in Asia. In this paper, I argue that the AII Bank is an institutionalized version of the Chinese revisionism and a new form of Chinese power projection. It is a status seeking institution, which is meant to give China more influence in global economic governance.

The article examines the history of infrastructure in India from the eighteenth century onwards. It argues that the development of roads, railways, canals, harbours, and waterways in the country was the outcome of a complex process of colonial rule. The article shows that these infrastructural developments were not the result of an engineering project, but rather the consequence of the interaction of various actors and agencies. These actors included the British state, the colonial bureaucracy, Indian elites, local communities, indigenous knowledge, private firms, labourers, engineers and technicians. They were all involved in a process which transformed the physical and social environment of India.

The main focus of the paper is on how the use of bicycles and pedestrian infrastructures affects the individual travel modes and the CO and emissons. The authors use a simulation model to estimate the changes in travel patterns in a city, the energy used and resulting CO emmissions. This is done for two different scenarios, one with the current situation and one where the non motorized and PT infrastrukture is improved. These scenarios are compared and evaluated. To do so, a methodology is developed that allows to compare different travel scenarios.

Infrastructural bottlenecks and inadequate public services can be a source of significant losses in productivity and well-being. At the same time, infrastructure investment can have significant positive effects on productive capacity and human development. In this paper, we review the empirical literature on the effects of infrastructures and services on economic growth and income distribution. We find that, in principle, the literature provides strong support for the view that public investments in infrastruture can raise growth. However, empirically the results are less clear. The main obstacle to stronger growth effects is that the quality of public infrastrcture and public service provision is often poor.

Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study of road infrastructures in the economics under-developing districts of north eastern India, using district-level data for 1995-96. The study reveals that the road density is lower in these districts than in most other parts of the country. This is mainly because of lesser road construction activities in recent years. In fact, the districts have suffered from a net decline in road length in terms of kilometers per 0.1 million population.

The need to develop a framework for environmental planning and management in infrastructural projects has been felt in India since long. The need has become more acute in recent years with the rapid growth of infrastruture development projects. In India, environmental impact assessment (EIA) has not been made mandatory for all projects as yet. Hence, the need for a systematic framework to address environmental concerns in the planning stage of projects is more important. This paper discusses the formulaton of such a planning framework. It presents a case study of a highway project in a hilly terrain in Karnataka, India. A framework is proposed for the implementation of the environmental component of this project.

Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are three of the most populous countries in South and Southeast Asia. Infrastructure has been identified as a key factor in promoting economic growth. This paper investigates the effects of investment in infrastructural facilities on economic development in these countries. The empirical analysis is based on the data from 1980 to 2008. Panel data regression analysis, a fixed effects model and a dynamic panel data model are used to examine the relationship between infrastruc-ture and economic performance in each country. A dynamic model is used for the first time to investigate the impact of regional infrastru-cture on income growth in India, Pakistan and Bangladeshi regions.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been promoting the development of infrastructure in the country by providing various financial incentives and support to the infrastructural projects. However, the financing of the projects is a major concern. In this context, infrastruc­ture debts funds (IDFs) have emerged as a new source of funding for infrastru­ctural development.
An IDF is defined as an alternative investment fund (AIF) that invests in infrastruture projects and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of In­dia (SEBI). IDFS are typically structured as closed-end funds and are allowed to invest in a wide range of infra­structure assets, including roads, power, ports, airports, water and sewage, railways, telecommunications and urban infrastr­ucture.

The study uses the panel data analysis to examine the relationship between infrastruc-ture and growth for the period 1990-2010. A fixed effects model is used to control for any potential time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity between states. Findings suggest that transport investments have a positive and significant impact on the economic develop-ment of the country. Moreover, the study also finds that the positive impact of invest-ments on growth is stronger in states with better governance and higher income.

Indian infrastructure,Globalisation and the changing face of port infrastructure: The Indian perspective,"Globalisation and the changing face of port infrastructure: The Indian perspective
The changing nature of globalisation, technological advances and increasingly sophisticated trade flows have led to a re-evaluation of the infrastructural requirements of ports. This paper analyses the current state of India's port and port-related infrastruture and its readiness to cope with the challenges of a more globalised world. It concludes that while the Indian port industry has shown great progress in the past few years, it needs to take a series of steps to ensure that it is adequately prepared to meet the demands of future trade.

Public infrastructures, such as roads and railways, are important for economic growth. Investment decisions in public infrastrruction are influenced by private and public actors. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of public and private investment for primary education in India. Using a panel data set of 14,895 villages from 2001 to 305, the study employs a two-step approach to analyse the impact of investments in infrastrucutre on primary enrolment. First, we analyise the determinants of primary infrastrcuture investement in the villages. Second, using the first step, a regression model is estimated to examine the effect of infrastrcture on school enrollment, controlling for village and state characteristics. We find that the private sector is the main investor in primary schools. Public investors are mainly involved in roads.

The study examines the association of health infrastructural development with the economic development of India at the state level for the period 1980-2014. The study uses the input-output approach to measure the healthcare infrastruture. Healthcare input is measured in terms of the expenditure on health in the GDP. On the other hand, health output is calculated in monetary terms. To measure health care infrastru-ture, the study takes the ratio of input to output. It is found that health input has a positive association and health outcome has an inverse association. In other words, more the investment in health, better is the outcome.

India is a country of stark regional disparities in terms of development. The economic development of the country is not evenly distributed across regions. Infrastructure, especially banking infrastructural facilities, is the key to economic growth. This paper examines the relationship between bank out-reaching and infrastruc-tural development in Indian States. It also exam-ines how the infrastru-ctural deve-lopment affects the regional economic outcomes. Using the 2012 Indian Census data and a dynamic panel data model, the results show that bank branches are positively related to infrastruce-tal development, and the effect is more pronounced in rural areas. Bank out reach is posit-ively associated with the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). Further, bank branch density is negatively related with income inequality.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the Indian economy. The Indian government is making efforts to revive the economy by investing in infrastructure projects.
Infrastructural projects such as roads, railways, airports, and ports are essential for the growth of the country. These projects not only provide employment opportunities but also boost the overall economy of India. However, the pandemics have affected the progress of these projects, leading to a decline in economic growth. To revitalize the infrastructures sector and accelerate the economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, it is essential to invest in these sectors.

Degeneration is a process of gradual decline, deterioration, or decay. In urban studies, degernation has been used to describe the process through which a city gradually loses its centrality and relevance, and is replaced by another city. However, this concept has not been widely used in the study of urban infrastructures and governments.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the degerneration of the urban water infrastrucre and the governace of Chenai. The study argues that the water governacne in chenna is degnerating in two ways: first, the city is losing its ability to maintain the existing water and sewerage infrastrucutre; second, it is unable to provide water to its residents. As a result, residents have to rely on private water suppliers, who are increasingly becoming more expensive and unreliable.",474,189,0.5178571428571429,6.712195723350998,0.8715728948537002,0.05771202511081822,0.8466666666666667,0.8330555555555564,0.7454055805048851,48.873056994818654,50.67261904761905,42.5865694489204

This paper explores the extent to which higher level education in India can contribute to building disruption resilience in cities. It identifies the main challenges faced by urban India in dealing with disruptions, such as the lack of effective urban planning and the inability of the state to provide basic services to citizens. These challenging conditions, coupled with the rapid urbanisation of India, make it necessary to consider adapting higher-education curricular to support the development of disastrous resistance in Indian cities, in particular, by developing adaptability, creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, problem-solving, information literacy, as well as other 21st-century skills.

In India, the role of airports is not limited to just providing air transportation services, they also play a vital role in the economic development of a region.
However, in recent years, there has been a growing concern about the state of Indian airport infrastruture. The Indian aviation industry has experienced a boom in air traffic and passenger numbers in past few years. This has led to a significant increase in demand for air travel, which has put pressure on the existing air infrastrucure. As a result, airlines are facing difficulties in meeting the increasing demand, and this has resulted in delays, cancellations and other problems.

A study of the impact of electrical and mechanical infrastructural improvements on the agriculture of New South Wales, Australia, is presented. The study was conducted in the context of a larger study examining the effects of infrastruture improvements and the provision of credit on farm management and production in NSW. A survey of 300 farmers in 20 rural localities was used to examine the effect of electricity and tractor use on management practices, farm size, and farm income. Results showed that electric lighting was associated with a reduction in farm labour, an increase in land area, a decrease in crop production, but an improvement in management efficiency. Tractor use was found to be associated only with increased farm area and a slight reduction of labour.

Mumabai is a city that has grown at a very fast pace. The population of this city has increased from 1.7 million in 2001 to 8.4 million. This growth has led to a large number of problems in terms of infrastructures and environment. In fact, the city is facing a lack of clean water, waste management, and housing. These problems are causing health issues and also a lot of stress to the population. Some of these problems have been caused by the rapid urbanization that Momabay has experienced.

This paper analyses the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the development of rural infrastructure in India. The paper is based on the premise that ITC can play a significant role in providing basic infrastructural services to the rural population. This is because the ICCs are already present in rural areas and are therefore well positioned to provide these services. In addition, the paper also examines the different types of infrastruc-ture that can be provided by ICDs, and the challenges that they face in doing so. Finally, it looks at some of the ways in which IACs can help to improve the quality of life for rural people.",493,198,0.6119402985074627,7.0837210897671525,0.8997271097573301,0.04714055006587067,0.8640000000000001,0.8825454545454546,0.7828625341645464,62.66062176165803,63.149253731343286,54.38728946337642

The construction industry is one of the most vital sectors of a country’s economy. The industry plays a crucial role in the development of infrastructure and the growth of an economy by providing employment opportunities and contributing to the GDP of countries. However, the construction sector in many countries faces numerous challenges, including delays in project completion, disputes between contractors and clients, and unethical practices. To address these challengers, many nations have enacted construction laws to regulate the industry and protect the interests of all stakeholders. In this article, we will explore the need for a construction law in countries like India, where the sector is growing rapidly but faces significant challenging.

This paper examines the role of policy and infrastructure in promoting agglomerations in the Indian organised manufacturing sector. The paper uses a unique data set of 14,419 establishments in 23 manufacture-intensive sectors, to examine the determinants of agglomeration in India. Results of the analysis show that policy has a limited role in shaping aglomera-tion. However, the infrastructural characteristics of a region have a strong impact on the probability of an establishment to be located in a cluster.

India is a large and fast growing country with a population of 1.2 billion and a rapidly growing economy. In the past, the infrastructures sector was mainly dominated by the public sector. However, in recent years, there has been a shift in this trend with the government now allowing the private sector to participate in infrastrucutral projects.
The government has also taken several steps to improve the ease of doing business in order to attract more foreign investments in these projects, which has led to an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India.
