Indian climate,Impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: a review,"Impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: a review
J. K. Srivastava, S. B. Singh, and A. R. Saxena
Agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy. It is responsible for the livelihood of about 60% of the total population of India. The impact of climatic changes on agricultural production is very significant. Climatic change is a natural phenomenon, but it is being aggravated by human activities. Increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased the atmospheric temperature. This temperature rise is causing changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. These changes are affecting agriculturally important crops and livestock.

Climate change is a global phenomenon, but the impacts are experienced locally. As a result, the governance of climate change and its mitigation and adaptation has been decentralised to the sub-national level. This has raised questions about the relationship between science and governments, and how science can be used to support policy decisions.
In India, climate science is being used by the government to make decisons about how to adapt to climate impact. However, there are concerns about whether the science being produced is reliable and relevant to policy. In this blog, Dr Mithika Mumba and Dr Katie Willis, from the University of East Anglia, discuss the challenges of using science to inform climate policy in India. They suggest that the way climate is governed is also an important factor in determining the extent to which science informs policy, as well as the capacity of",1,193,0.4945054945054945,6.671243849949911,0.8646817617480632,0.059873435401780535,0.84,0.8344303797468353,0.7282631751484483,40.25789791507755,41.23076923076923,42.648989898989896

Increasing trends in water stress and water scarcity are some of the major issues that are affecting the water resources of India.
By: Shashank Shekhar | Published: July 27, 1998 5:00 am
Water is a precious resource. It is an essential requirement for the survival of all life forms. Water is required for drinking, agriculture, industry, and for recreational purposes. The water available on the earth is limited and its availability is affected by a number of factors. One of these factors is climate. Climate is the average of weather conditions over a long period of time. Thus, climate is defined as the typical weather patterns of a particular region. In a region, the climate varies from place to place. For example, in India, there are different types of climates in different regions. Similarly, climatic",2,190,0.5178571428571429,6.712195723350998,0.8715728948537002,0.05771202511081822,0.8333333333333334,0.7988888888888899,0.7379321846553593,33.81272659082386,38.99404761904762,35.70834117868574
Indian climate,Fractal dimensional analysis of Indian climatic dynamics,"Fractal dimensional analysis of Indian climatic dynamics
The Indian monsoon is an important driver of the Indian economy and the livelihood of over 1.2 billion people. It is also a complex system, whose dynamics are difficult to predict, because of its dependence on several external and internal factors. In this work, we use fractals to study the dynamics of monetary and climatological time series. We use the Hurst exponent, which is a measure of long range dependence, to quantify the nonlinearity of these time-series. The Hurts exponent is related to the fd-dimension of a time serie, and we find that the monitory time scale and that of climatoligical time scales have fracional dimensions of 0.89 and 2.02, respectively.

The Indian Building Code (IBC) 2005 recommends a minimum U-value of 1.2 W/m2K for windows. However, the energy performance of the windows depends on the thermal insulation of other components of building envelope. A study was conducted to evaluate the performance in terms of heat transfer coefficient (U-Value) of various glazing systems (single glazed, double glaze, triple glazes and laminated glasses) under different climatic conditions of India. The results show that the triple-glazed windows have the highest U value (0.47 W/(m.K)) and the single-glass windows the lowest (15.14 Wm-2. K-1) among the different window types.

Reference evaporative fraction (Et) is an important input parameter for estimating crop water requirement. The accuracy of various reference Et equations (REEs) was evaluated for the period 1980-2010 across different agro-climatic regions of India. It was found that the REEs could not predict the actual Et across all the regions. A new equation was proposed by regressing the observed Et on the available meteorological data.

India is among the top ten emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the world. Its per capita emissions are among lowest in Asia. The country’s emitting sectors are power generation, industry and transport. India’ policy response to climate action has been limited to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol and the Joint Implementation (JI) mechanism under EU Emission Trading Scheme.
In 2008, the Indian government set up a National Climate Change Council (NCCC) to develop a national climate policy. In 1997, India had ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climatic Change (UNFCC) and in 8010 it had signed the Proto-Climate Change Agreement (PCCA",9,180,0.6363636363636364,7.6098022910645255,0.9089261991021899,0.0422550355558125,0.944,0.9109243697478983,0.8218550563749685,81.85955121894159,82.9020979020979,79.69305555555556

Water is a major requirement for human life and is the basic need for all living organisms. Water scarcity is becoming a serious problem worldwide. Solar still is one of the oldest and cheapest methods for water purification. Passive solar distillation (PSD) and solar-assisted distiller (SAD) are the two major types of solar water distilling systems. The performance analysis of a PSD and SAD system has been carried out for a month in different climates of India.
The PESD system was constructed at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Mumbai, India, for the purpose of studying the performance under different climate conditions. A 100 L SASD was also constructed for performance comparison. Both the systems were operated in the same climatological conditions and were subjected to the following tests:

The monetary cost of the 2010 floods in Pakistan is estimated to be 3.2 billion USD. This is a devastating price to pay for the lives lost and the infrastructure destroyed. However, the cost is much higher when considering the human and economic impact of future flooding. The current mono-cropping, irrigation practices, and urbanization patterns of Pakistan are unsustainable. As a result, climate change and increasing flood frequency will have a large impact on the economy and society of this region.

Climate change is a pressing global challenge. India is one of the countries most affected by climate change. It is also a country that has been active in the international climate regime and has an increasingly important role in international negotiations. This paper analyses the development of Indian climate policy, focusing on the role of diplomatic and economic instruments and the influence of domestic and international actors. The paper argues that India has gradually moved from a position of scepticism to a more active and cooperative role. However, the country's position is still strongly influenced by its domestic development and climate policies. In the future, India will be an important actor in climate negotiatios, but its role will depend on how the domestic policies and diplomats are able to balance the interests of its different actors and how it can successfully combine economic development with climate mitigation.",13,181,0.4581005586592179,6.128967760565874,0.8495067481393985,0.06680118489360289,0.84,0.8518709677419353,0.7431940986906214,44.75,45.324022346368714,44.667826988594285

This paper examines the role of policy story lines in climate change politics. It takes a narrative approach to analyze the politics of climate policy in India. In particular, the paper aims to understand how the narratives of the climate crisis and the need for a low-carbon economy are used to advance different policy agendas. The paper develops the notion of a policy narration, which is a storyline about a specific policy issue that is told to a particular audience in order to persuade them to support a certain policy. These narrations are then used by policy actors to legitimize their policy claims. By examining the use of these narrational tools, this paper illustrates how policy stories can be used strategically to create new policy spaces.

The present work deals with the theoretical analysis on the energy savings of the air-conditioning systems using a heat-pipe heat exchange. The energy analysis is carried out for the different climates in India. In the present study, a theoretical model is developed to calculate the efficiency of a typical air handling unit (AHU) with heat pipes in an air distribution system. A theoretical study is done to analyze the performance of heat pump heat recovery system (HPHRS) in Indian climate. An HPHRS is a system that recovers heat from the exhaust air of an AHUs and uses it to preheat the fresh air supplied to the AU. To analyze HPHPR system, the temperature profile of exhaust and fresh streams is calculated using the heat balance method.

The building energy efficiency is one of the major concerns for the sustainable development. The energy consumption in buildings is rising due to the increasing energy demand for heating and cooling. Therefore, the retrofitting of building is considered as one the most effective methods for energy saving. This paper presents the dynamic optimization approach for retrofit of existing building to enhance the energy
efficiency. A case of a 3-story building with an area of 200 m2 is studied. An optimization model is developed to identify the best retro-fit combination for a building which can reduce the total energy use. Different retro fit options are considered in the optimization process to find the optimal combination.
Based on the results, it is found that the building can be retro fitted to save 12.9% of total annual energy cost. It is also found the that optimal retro fitting",21,184,0.48633879781420764,6.579069311495698,0.8616274692051717,0.06116045178740871,0.8742857142857143,0.8598742138364781,0.7426550095913109,51.57782240316901,51.595628415300546,47.85139692927259

The climate of the Indian subcontinent is generally tropical with a monsoon type of rainfall pattern. The climate is dominated by the large landmass of Asia and the surrounding oceanic bodies. India is located in the Northern Hemisphere and its climate can be classified as having a tropical mono-modal climate.
India has three seasons- the summer, the monetary and winter. Summer starts from the month of March and lasts till the end of June. Monsoons start in June and continue till September. Winter season starts in November and ends in February. Indian climate varies from region to region. In general, Indian winters are cool and dry, summers are hot and humid and monseys are wet. However, it is important to note that the climate in India varises from one region of a country to another.

The agriculture sector is the backbone of the Indian economy. The sector contributes about 17% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 45% of total employment in the country. India is a food-deficit country and is dependent on imports for meeting its food requirements. However, in recent years, India has been able to meet its own food requirement. This achievement has come about due to a number of factors including the Green Revolution, the introduction of new crops, and improved farming practices.
However, with climate change, it is expected that the agriculturally productive areas of India will be shifted towards the north and east. Thus, there will likely be a decrease in agriculturable land in western and southern India. As a result, agriculturer productivty is likely to decline in these regions.

Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture in India
Climate change is a global phenomenon and India is not an exception. The impact of this change can be seen in the form of erratic rainfall, rise in sea level, change in seasonal pattern, increase in temperature, etc. These changes have a negative impact on agricultural production in terms of reduced crop yield, higher cash and food grain price, increased incidence of pests and diseases, and so on.
This has led to an increase of 22% in food inflation in 1998-9 and 38% increase during 97-8. In 70% of the districts in North India, wheat and rice production has decreased due to climate changes. This has resulted in an increased dependence on imported food. It has also led farmers to switch to non-food crops.

South Indian ocean climate is strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and the ENSO cycle. These two modes of variabilty are linked, with EOF analysis of SAM indices suggesting a relationship between SST anomalies in the Southwest Pacific and Indian Oceans. The SASMOD model is used to explore the relationship and to investigate the mechanics of this linkage. A simple model of tropical SOMC is constructed, which captures the dominant features of observed SOSC. This model uses a combination of linear and non-linear mechanisims to explain the observed relationship. It is shown that the model can reproduce the SAT anomaly pattern, and that ERA40 data are consistent with the linear model.

In a recent report, the World Bank warns that climate-related disasters could cost India’s economy $110 billion annually by 2050, if current trends continue. The report estimates that the agricultural sector would be the most severely affected, with losses of up to 17% of GDP by the middle of the century.
The report says that India could avoid such losses by taking steps to make its agriculturesystem more resilient to climate shocks. It recommends that, in addition to reducing emissions, India should invest in agriculturereforms and climate adaptation measures. For example, it suggests that agricultureresearch should focus more on drought-resistant varieties of crops.

The Green revolution in the 1960s and 70’s was a major technological development in Indian agriculture. It introduced a new set of high yielding varieties of wheat and rice, improved farm management practices and a set new farm machinery. The Green-revolution was accompanied by a rapid expansion in irrigation, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and use more intensive farm practices. This technologically induced transformation of Indian farming led to a significant increase in agricultural output, a sharp fall in food prices and improved rural livelihoods. However, the high yields and rapid growth in crop production were achieved at the cost of increasing the demand for water and other resources, increased use and release of toxic chemicals, degradation of",47,190,0.5660377358490566,7.137464271463297,0.8877282921147539,0.051000206480193,0.8666666666666667,0.8740740740740742,0.7893764667542064,49.904205607476634,59.9685534591195,58.21347402597402

Earth’s climate system is driven by natural cycles that can have a significant impact on the weather. One of the most important is the Indian ocean dipolar mode (IODM), which is an oscillation of sea surface temperature (SST) between the eastern and western equatorial Indian oceans.
Scientists have long recognised that IODM events are associated with changes in global rainfall patterns, but it has been unclear how these events influence the climate on a global scale. Now, researchers have used a combination of climate models and satellite observations to investigate the impact of IOMD events. They found that the events can lead to increased rains in the tropics and changes to the atmospheric circulation, which can in turn lead changes elsewhere in climate. The findings were published in Nature Climate Change.",54,198,0.5786163522012578,7.296074588606926,0.8920643193588964,0.049030535857732704,0.8999999999999999,0.8859259259259261,0.804295271057036,62.40724145407242,68.9622641509434,68.0404135338346

The world has been experiencing a significant warming trend since the mid-19th century. There is now overwhelming scientific evidence that the warmer the climate, the higher is the crop yield. However, a warmed climate also brings with it increased risks of extreme weather events like droughts and floods. The Indian economy is heavily dependent on agricultural production, which is highly vulnerable to weather extremes. This paper examines the impact of global climate changes on Indian cereal production. It finds that, in the absence of any policy changes, global warmers will lead to an increase in Indian rice and wheat production by 10-20 per cent by the year 2115.

Climate change adaptation is a challenge for developing countries like India. A study of farmer's knowledge and adaptation behaviour was undertaken in four villages in Rajasthan, India to understand the role of knowledge in adaptation. The study found that the farming communities in the villages were generally knowledgeable about climate and climate variability. They had good knowledge of weather and rainfall and also knew about the effects of climate on their crops and livestock.

Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, and it is highly dependent on climate. The Indian Agriculture sector is characterized by a wide diversity in terms of crops, soil types, agro-climatic conditions, farm sizes and farming systems. In addition, the sector exhibits high regional diversities.
The agricultural sector of India is not only the largest source of livelihood but also a major contributor to the country’s GDP. Agricultural production in India has been a matter of concern for a long time. Despite the efforts of various governments, agriculturists and scientists, there has not been much improvement in the agricultual productivity. This is mainly due to poor utilization of resources and lack of proper technology. Therefore, it becomes imperative to improve the productive capacity of Indian farmers.",69,193,0.5949367088607594,7.478238471251862,0.8974240982402913,0.04665388812486292,0.8933333333333332,0.8773134328358213,0.781816067084199,56.475079226184846,58.68354430379747,58.771321321321324

The Indian and Pacific oceans are connected by the Indian-Pacific Ocean Conveyor (IPOC). This large-scale ocean circulation system is a major contributor to the global climate system, and is strongly influenced by variations in the strength of the trade winds over the tropical Indian, Pacific and Atlantic ocean regions. The IPOC has recently been shown to be a significant contributing factor to climate variability in both the Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean.
In a paper published in Nature, scientists from the University of East Anglia, the UK Met Office and NERC's British Antarctic Survey, have shown that the IPO warms in response to changes in Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). They also show that this warmed Indian ocean, in turn, has a strong influence on the climate of South Africa, which is located near the",73,199,0.5344827586206896,7.050311805283801,0.878571604736113,0.054195816207549534,0.8666666666666667,0.874133333333333,0.7772932421609001,62.68280909374027,63.46551724137931,57.096688034188034

Tropical climate in general and the monsoon in particular have been undergoing major changes in recent decades. These changes are characterized by an increase in rainfall extremes, and a decrease in mean rains. In the present study, the observed changes have also been investigated for the tropical Indian ocean region. The observed change in tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) is known to be a major driver of the recent changes. It is shown that the changes observed in Indian region are primarily due to the influence of changes over the eastern Indian and western Pacific Ocean. A comparison of observed and simulated changes is also presented.

In this blog, we explore the sensitivity of Indian Agriculture in the face of climate variability and change. We find that Indian farmers are more sensitive to rainfall and temperature than other farming communities in Africa.
Climate change has a direct impact on the agricultural sector, which is the backbone of the Indian economy. The impact of global warming on Indian climate is evident in changes in rainy seasons, floods, droughts, and extreme heat. These changes have a cascading impact in terms of crop yield, livestock production, human health, food security, etc. In addition, the impacts of extreme weather events are exacerbated by the growing population, urbanisation, industrialisation and land degradation. Thus, India is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climatic variabilities and changes.

Abstract. The monetary value of rainfall in India is high, and the impact of its variabilities on the economy is even higher. This is due to the fact that the country is highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture. In this paper, the mono-seasonal rains of the Indian summer mon-soons (ISM) are studied in relation with the global vari-abilities of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and oceanic heat content (OHC). The analysis is based on observations of ISM ra-infalls and SST anomalies. ISMR is found to be highly correlated with SAT anomaly over the whole country.

A study published in Climate Dynamics shows that future climate warming will lead to an increase in the intensity of Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) in general, but the magnitude of change will vary across the country.
In this study, the authors used a high-resolution climate model to simulate the ISM under historical (1950-2005) and future (2101- 2299) conditions. The model was driven by the output of a global climate simulation under historic and RCP8.5 (a scenario of future warmer and wetter climate) forcing. Under future conditions, ISR will be warmed by about 0.6-06.4°C. However, it will become more variable in terms of the seasonal mean and the interannual variabilities.

Climate change is a global concern and a major issue for the farming community. Farmers are vulnerable to climate variability and climate-related disasters. The perceptual differences between farmers and non-farmers regarding climate risk are less understood. In this study, we aim to understand the perpective of farms towards climate risks and their adaptation strategies.
We used a survey of 182 farmland holders and 204 nonfamers in the western HImalayan region of India. We used the AHP approach to analyse the data. Descriptive statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to assess the differences in percpetion of risk between the two groups.

Abstract. The Indian summer mon-soons are known to be highly sensitive to the ocean-atmosphere interaction. In this study, the role of Indian ocean in the variabilities of regional precipitation and temperature is investigated. A composite analysis of daily temperature and rainy days over India is performed over 1984–2014 using the observed data from the India Meteorological Department. It is found that the mono-modal distribution of rains is highly influenced by the SST anomalies over the central Indian and the southwest Indian oceans. However, a strong association between the raining days and SLP anomaly is not observed.

The agreement also sets a long-term goal to achieve a balance between sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by the second half of this century. India has ratified the Paris agreement and is committed to achieving the goals set under the agreement.

The Western Ghat mountain range is an important climatic feature in peninuslar India. It is a barrier to the southwest monsoon and is responsible for the present day rainy season pattern in the western part of India, which is characterized by a distinct raining season (June to September) and a dry season. The Western ghat also has a profound effect on rains in southern India and the eastern coast of Africa.
It has been known for some time that the rainiest part in south India is the region around the city of Mangalore. This is where the rain shadow of Western India begins and it is also the place where most of south Indian raindrops are produced. In this study, the climatological effect of this mountain barier is investigated using a numerical weather prediction model.

The analysis is based upon the CMIP3 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3) database, which contains 16 models and 21 ensembles of simulations for the period 00-099. A number of indices of temperature and precipitation are computed for different seasons, regions and timescales. It is found that the spatial pattern of changes in precipitations is more complex than that of temperatures, with some regions experiencing increases in rainfall and others decreases. However, the magnitude of change is not uniform across the country.

Abstract. In this study, we examine the atmospherically‐induced variability in sea surface temperature (SST) and the associated hydrological cycle over the equatorward region of the Indian monsoon westerlies. We use the Coupled Ocean‐Atmosphere Data Assimilation System (COADS) to examine these processes and their influence on SST. The COAD‐based analysis reveals a large-scale atmosperic response to SAT anomaly in this region, which is characterized by a southward shift of a strong wavelike Rossby wave response in SLP and a weakening of convection in a region extending from the eastern equitorial Indian ocean to the Maritime Continent",96,184,0.674074074074074,7.832032988997221,0.9195936436312871,0.03774354871420766,0.9040000000000001,0.9005405405405404,0.8343349377034085,83.23862968621461,95.52592592592593,94.57664437012264

The mono-seasonal nature of the Asian summer mon- soon rainfall has been a major impediment to the successful prediction of this phenomenon. The present study investigates the ability of global and regional models to represent this monosonal climate feature. Global models are found to be able to capture the monoso- nal feature of Indian summer rains in terms of spatial pattern, seasonal cycle and interannual variability. However, the regional model simulates rainy days, but is unable to simulate the spatial patterns of ra- infall. This may be due to its inability to resolve the moisture transport processes.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has identified six major climatic zones in the country, viz. tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, semi-arid and arid. The Indian climate is characterized by three major seasons, i.e. summer, winter and monsoon.
Climate is the long term pattern of weather. Climate is influenced by various factors like latitude, altitude, distance from the sea, land and water distribution, prevailing winds, topography, and so on. India is situated between 8°N to 37° N latitudes and 68o E to97oE longitudes. It has a vast geographical area and varied climates. Due to the variation in latitude and altitudes, India has varied climate.

The global climate change regime is notoriously unequal in terms of the responsibilities it assigns to different countries. As a result, the climate regime has been criticized for being too weak to solve the problem it seeks to address. This paper argues that the Indian state's emergent climate policy reflects the inequalities of this regime, but that it also creates the conditions for a more equal regime in the future. India' s climate policies have been shaped by the country'''s weak capacity, its limited bargaining power, and the lack of international support for its interests. In response, India has pursued a strategy of 'opportunistic compliance' with the regime. The paper shows that this strategy has had mixed results. While it has contributed to the internationalization of Indian climate politics, it simultaneously has undermined the domestic legit",103,200,0.5280898876404494,7.045597876561097,0.876782045829357,0.05475331451205701,0.8628571428571429,0.8714285714285716,0.7626368487874093,59.333333333333336,56.151685393258425,59.19409430438843

The objective of this paper is to study the performance of photothermal (PT) collector, photocollector and photoplume collectors for energy production and energy storage in the form of sensible and latent heat. The monthly performance analysis is carried out using MATLAB and Simulink for a typical Indian location. A detailed energy analysis for each collecting element is performed and the results are compared with the month-wise energy output of the PV system. It is observed that PT collecter performs better than the photolume and PVC collecters. In case of PTC, the energy collected by the collective elements is stored in a thermal storage tank. Hence, it is used to produce the required energy in winter season. This helps in increasing the overall energy yield of a PTS system by 1",105,195,0.5371428571428571,7.105732092573472,0.8796675806526433,0.053647070060997476,0.8857142857142856,0.8603973509933774,0.7800365286577927,58.333333333333336,59.777142857142856,54.72257525083612

Indian climate,Assessing the impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: Evidence from major crop yields,"Assessing the impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: Evidence from major crop yields
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the implications of changing climate on agricultural production in India. Design/methodology/approach – This paper assesses the effects of temperature and precipitation on the major crops of India: rice, wheat, maize, soybean, sugarcane, cotton, and pearl millet. The study is based on a panel data of 29 years (1980-2008). Findings – Increase in temperature leads to a decline in rice production, whereas increase in precipitations leads a rise in the production of wheats and maizes. In case of soya bean, there is a positive impact on production. However, the effect of change in climate is not significant for sugar cane and cotten. Research limitations/implications – It is observed that climate has a significant effect on rice",107,189,0.49101796407185627,6.345350506779922,0.8610247313259973,0.06252496459984845,0.8666666666666667,0.8545454545454543,0.7605513855429835,47.02539249835933,47.32335329341317,43.171632216678546

The Hindu Kush Hindukush (HKH) is a unique mountain range, stretching from Afghanistan to Nepal and from Pakistan to China, covering a total area of 3500 km2 and with a population of around 20 million. The HK region is known to be vulnerable to climate change and variability. Apart from the fact that it is an important source of water for 1.3 billion people living in India, Pakistan, Afghan-istan, China and Central Asia, the HH region has the potential to play a significant role in mitigating the impact of climate vari-ability and change. In fact, it has been suggested that the role of HI region in climate miti-gation is crucial and that any climate policy for the region should include a HIMALAYA-wide approach.

The impacts of climate change on agricultural production are likely to be severe in India. This paper assesses the sensitivities of the Indian crop sector to temperature and rainfall changes, using a state-of-the-art cereal production model. We find that the impact of temperature change is more severe than that of rains. In the absence of adaptation, the net negative impact is about 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2050. With adaptation to climate variability, this impact reduces to 8% by the same year.

The Indian summer Monsoons (ISM) is the dominant mode of seasonal climate variability in the Indian subcontinent. The ISM is characterized by a southwest mon-soonal flow of moisture-laden air from the tropical Indian ocean, and is accompanied by heavy rainfall in India and Pakistan during June to September. This mono-sonal system is also known as the South Asian Mono sonal Pulse (SAM).
Several studies have shown that the SAM is closely linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, the mechanism of this link is still unclear. In addition, there is evidence that ENSO may have played a role in climate changes in South Asia during pre-historic times.

Climate change is likely to have an impact in all sectors of human activity, including health. It is already affecting food security, water supply, energy, human migration, infectious disease transmission, natural disasters, coastal erosion and forestry. These changes are likely not only to reduce the quality of life, but also to affect the ability of health systems to respond to health challenges.

The Indian economy has experienced rapid growth in the last two decades, and this has been accompanied by a shift towards more energy intensive food consumption. In this study, we assess the implications of the projected increase in food demand for greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from the agriculture sector. We use the FAO food balance sheets, the IPCC 2007 Tier 1 and Tier2 methodologies and the LCA-IPCC method to estimate the GHGEs (g CO2e/MJ) from crop and livestock production. Our results show that the Indian agricultura sector is responsible for 4.3% of global GGGE in 3.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) per year.

Here, we investigate the association between the Indian summer mon-soonal rainevents and south-western winter (May–September) storms, using a 10-yr record of daily raingauge data from the south coast of Western Australia. The results show that the frequency of southwesterly storm events is strongly influenced by the strength of the southern annular mode (SAM), a pattern of climate variation in the Southern Hemisphere.

Today, more than half of the world’s population lives in cities. Cities are a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for 60–80% of total global emissons. Closing this gap is essential to achieving the Paris Agreement.
In the context of climate change, cities are the main actors in the transition to a low-carbon society. They are responsible for the design, implementation and monitoring of local climate policies and initiatives. In addition, they are also the drivers of global climate action. The role of cities in climate policy is therefore critical. However, research on this topic is still limited. It is necessary to increase the knowledge on the role and potential of urban areas in achving climate objectives. This is why, in 2018, the EU-funded project CITY-GOLD was launched.

Indian climate,The influence of the Indian Ocean dipole on atmospheric circulation and climate,"The influence of the Indian Ocean dipole on atmospheric circulation and climate over the Horn of Africa
The Indian-Ocean dipoles (IOD) are large-scale coupled ocean-atmosphere oscillations that occur over tropical Indian ocean. They are known to have a significant impact on the climate of East Africa and the region is prone to frequent droughts and floods associated with the IOD events. This study investigates the impact of IODI on climate and atmos-pherics circulations over Horn-of-Africa (HOA) and East- Africa. The analysis is based on monthly averaged sea-level pressure (SLP) fields and month-to-month changes in SLP anomalies for the period 1980-2010. IODi events are identified using the SST anomaly of 0°C as a threshold value. Results show that IODis have significant influence on SPL anom-alyses over HOA.

Agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy. It contributes to 17% of the GDP and provides livelihood to over 58% population. The sector is also responsible for 24% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is a major source of water consumption.
The sector has been experiencing various challenges like climate variability, unpredictable rainfall patterns, extreme weather events, water scarcity, soil degradation and decline in soil fertility. These challenging conditions are likely to worsen due to climate changes. In order to cope with these challenged, the sector needs to adopt various adaptation measures. As per the assessment by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the agricultural productivity is likely be reduced by 4.2% by the end of 8th decade",131,182,0.6333333333333333,7.756717518813398,0.908842217466139,0.041890606450677555,0.8999999999999999,0.8806349206349205,0.8204271206531599,77.43142144638404,77.03333333333333,72.03911058169545

Severe flooding in the Indian Subcontinents has been increasing in recent years. The number of floods in India has increased by 20% since 1950 and flooded area increased 400%. The impacts of climate change are expected to increase the floody risk.
The study, published in PNAS, shows that the number and severity of the flash flooda in Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are increasing. This is due to the increase in precipitation intensity and the increased frequency of extreme rainfall events. In India, the average rainstorm duration has doubled over the last 60 years and extreme rain events have increased from 5 to 8 per year. A 3°C warmer climate is expected by the end of this century.

The report, Urban Green Space Planning for Climate Adaptation in India Cities, is a joint publication by ICLEI South Asia and the World Resources Institute India. It provides a comprehensive overview of the state of urban green spaces in cities across India, and makes recommendations for green infrastructure planning to support climate change adaptation.
Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate risks, as they are home to a majority of India’s population. The report finds that cities are highly vulnerably to flooding and extreme heat, with extreme weather events affecting cities such as Chennai, Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata and Ahmedabad. A lack of planning has led to cities having a very low green cover, which exacerbates the impacts of climate-related events.

Abstract. Urban areas are exposed to flood hazards due to land uses and land cover changes. Increasing urbanization and global warming will further increase the floods in cities. However, there is a lack of studies on the combined effects of urban expansion and urban climate. This study aims to assess the impacts of these two factors on flooded areas in Indian urban centres. For this purpose, a spatially explicit model, which combines land-use and rainfall-runoff models, was used. The model was applied to 152 urban catchments in India. Flooded area was defined as the area covered by floody waters during rainy season. Land use data was obtained from Corine land Cover 2006 data. Rainfall data were obtained for the period 01-10-",135,197,0.5344827586206896,7.050311805283801,0.878571604736113,0.054195816207549534,0.8799999999999999,0.8594666666666666,0.7908126295808193,58.0,56.85057471264368,50.8125

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) highlights the need for local-level planning to incorporate climate considerations, including adaptation and mitigation. However, the extent to which climate concerns are addressed in spatial planning is not well understood. This paper presents an evaluation tool to assess the level of climate integration in the spatial development plans of Indian urban areas. The evaluation includes both a qualitative assessment of the plans, based on a set of indicators, as well as a quantitative analysis of plan-related information. It is found that the majority of plans do not include climate-sensitive indications. While the indication of miti- gation actions is generally weak, adaptation is more prevalent. In addition, it is demonstrated that adaptation indic- ations are more likely to be included in plans when there is a greater degree of stakeholder involvement",136,197,0.5489130434782609,7.445818785822305,0.8849812790325269,0.0507849769632393,0.8514285714285713,0.8530000000000009,0.7977607318738136,58.338541666666664,61.21195652173913,49.88452380952381

Climate change is a global challenge that is affecting all nations. In India, climate-related issues have been on the policy agenda since the early 1990s. This paper examines the political context of the development of Indian climate policy, and the emergence of narrative of cobbenefit as a key element of its discourse. It also looks at how the narration of this cobbeneft has been used to justify the adoption of a mitigation-centric approach to climate action. The paper concludes that the politics around climate in the country is marked by a dominant narrativ of technological fix, which has led to a narrow and technocratic approach.

Sarath Guttal
Climate change is expected to affect the Indian economy through its impact on agricultural production and hence on the food security of the country. This paper uses a spatial econometric approach to estimate the impact of climate on Indian crop production. The econometrics is based on a panel of 29 states and 19 crops over the period 30 years (1899-12). The results suggest that the spatial variation in the effect of temperature on cereal yields is large, and that cobweb-shaped spatial patterns emerge. While the average impact is negative, the magnitude of this impact varies across states. In addition, there are significant regional differences in sensitivities to rainfall.

Ecologists and other scientists have long recognized the importance of time in ecosystem dynamics. Yet, little is known about how people incorporate time into their knowledge of ecologically relevant phenomena. This paper explores the role of seasonal and annual time cycles in traditional eco- logical knowledge (TEK) of the indigenous Jarawa people of India's Andamans Islands. It is argued that the Jarawas' TEK of environmental change is strongly time-dependent, with season and year having a high degree of predictive power. The TE K is also strongly culture-specific, in that it is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of local ecology and seasonally relevant environmental phenom- ena. In addition, TEIK is often linked",140,182,0.6163522012578616,7.771905540037812,0.904528335071377,0.043368669775152066,0.9199999999999999,0.9285925925925919,0.8106078612932232,82.20632317121081,84.54088050314465,85.52549019607844

The tropical Pacific Ocean has experienced significant warmer-than-average surface temperatures in recent decades, but the Indian and Atlantic Oceans have also warmed. In this study, the role of the atmos-pheres in warping the global ocean temperature field is investigated. The Indian ocean is simulated in three general circulation models (GCMs) with a variety of ocean and atmosphere configurations. All models show an increase in tropical ocean heat content, and the magnitude of this war-ming is related to the strength of zonal winds over the ocean. Two of these models, with atmosph-eres that are dynamically coupled with the ocea-n, show a significant increase of sea surface temperature (SST) in both the Pacific and Indian O-cean.

In the case of India, the AR4 has predicted a reduction in annual precipitation in India by between 0.5 and 6.0% by the end of the ­century.
This reduction is expected to be most pronounced in semi-arid and arid regions of northwest, north, central and northeastern India. This would result in a significant reduction of water available for agricultural use. It is estimated that about a quarter of irrigated agricultur­al lands in north India are likely be affected by this",149,198,0.5636363636363636,7.240040180702163,0.887710124661921,0.05063841640480763,0.8933333333333332,0.8899290780141849,0.7975634269926043,58.47361307516106,66.7090909090909,56.98273373878982

Jaspreet Kaur,
The study aims to understand the mainstreamed climate adaptation actions in Kolka-ta, a city in India. It also seeks to identify the challenges faced by the city government and the way forward for main-stream climate action. The study finds that the Kol-kat-a Municipal Corporation (KMC) has taken several adaptation measures in the form of infrastructure development, institutional strengthening, policy development and capacity building. However, the study identifies that these measures are not well planned and are disconnected from the climate vulnerability of the community. This is due to the absence of a climate resilient city action plan. Further, there is a lack of coordination among the different agencies working on climate related issues. Therefore, for effective main stream-ing of climate actions, it is crucial to have a proper",151,189,0.543859649122807,7.111887749987415,0.8815433844209584,0.05304828567669944,0.86,0.8631292517006809,0.7734016268037345,57.41803278688525,55.72514619883041,55.67355371900827

This chapter examines the ways in which climate has been represented in India’s mainstream print media, with a specific focus on the Indian Express. The paper argues that climate coverage in the main Indian English-language print press is largely limited to the weather and weather-related disasters. It arguably reflects the broader societal lack of engagement with climate issues. However, this study finds that there has also been a rise in coverage of the issue of ‘climate change’ in Indian newspapers.

An analysis of orbital forcing mechanisms on the monsoonal climate of India has been performed using a coupled ocean–atmosphere model (COAMPS). The model has a 1.44° resolution in both the ocean and the atmosphere, and is forced by both orbiter and radiative forcing. The orbitor forcing is a combination of both precession and obliquity, while the radiati ve forcing consists of a CO2 forcing and an orbite r forcing that is similar to the orbitu r oblique forcing, but with a lower magnitude. Our model shows that the predominant effect of obliquit y is to increase the intensity of summer mon- soons, which is in agreement with previous model studies. We show that obl iquity also increases the frequency of extreme mon soon events, defined as those events that are more intense",163,182,0.5740740740740741,7.306770072260991,0.8909117772894658,0.049372021458344996,0.8666666666666667,0.8675362318840569,0.7906989995457907,46.32350186569938,56.22839506172839,44.68562976935608

A model of the Indian ocean is developed from the global couple model GEOS-3. The model is forced by the sea surface temperature (SST) from a global ocean couple climate simulation. An ocean eddy-resolving model, the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), is used to study the ocean circulation. A new parameterization of oceanic heat flux is introduced to represent the effect of eddies on the heat exchange between the surface and the subsurface ocean. This parameterized formulation is applied in a couple ocean-atmosphere model to simulate the variabilities of SST and rainfall in India. Simulations are conducted for the period 1958-1899. It is found that the couple system is able to reproduce the observed variabilites of Indian rainy season, and that it is the interplay between ocean and atmosphere that is responsible for these variabilties.

The paper uses the UCLs concept to identify the areas in which the heat is concentrated in a city. This is done by analyzing the urban surface temperature in 100 m resolution for the year 2016. A land use land cover map is used to classify the land surface into different categories. To identify UHIs, the temperature of land surfaces in different land-use categories is compared with the average temperature for a particular zone. These zones are classified into three categories: (a) UHI hotspots, (b) moderate UHLs, and (c) no ULHI zones.

The Indian mono-soonal rainfall regime is characterized by a strong seasonal cycle and a significant interannual variability. In this study, the authors use the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) to simulate the mon-o soonal climate of India using three different nested domain sizes: 20, 10 and 5°. The authors focus on the large-scale circulation and the associated monosonal precipitation and find that the 40-yr mean precipita-tion is most sensitive to the domain-size selection. This is due to a combination of both the circula-tional changes and precipitaton response to these changes.

Climate change is a reality and there is no doubt about its impact on global warming. This has led to a change in the global energy scenario with a growing demand for alternative energy sources. India has been a major producer and consumer of biofuel. However, with the increase in demand, it has also been facing the problem of the availability of feedstock for bioethanol production. The use of agricultural residues, which are otherwise considered as waste, for the production of ethanols is not economically viable due to the high cost of production and the low price of petroleum-based fuels. In this context, the Government of India, in 2009, announced the National Policy on Biofuelfor the promotion of second generation bio-ethylol.

Indian climate,"Learning, adaptation, and climate uncertainty: Evidence from Indian agriculture","Learning, adaptation, and climate uncertainty: Evidence from Indian agriculture
In recent years, the Indian government has launched a number of programs to increase the resilience of agricultural producers to climate shocks. This paper assesses the impact of these programs on farmers' adaptation strategies and their well-being. The analysis relies on a large-scale survey of farming households in India conducted in 2010 and 11. It finds that climate risk has increased in recent decades, especially in the rainfed areas of India. We find that farmer adaptations to this risk have been successful in reducing the adverse impacts of climate variability. However, we also find evidence of increasing climate-related uncertainty. Farmers' uncertainty has been increasing in part because of the changing nature of rains, which has led to increasing uncertainty about the timing and amount of monsoon rainstorms, as well as the amount and distribution of pre-monsoonal and",170,193,0.5087719298245614,6.653056282246291,0.8685726068183811,0.05885697362837675,0.86,0.8731972789115651,0.7655700308573654,47.58953595838885,52.760233918128655,53.714105339105345

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed interannual to decadal variabilities of the tropical climate. These mechanistic links are not independent but interact with each other and the ocean-atmosphere coupled system. In this study, we focus on the interactions between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in the Indian subcontinent and between ENSO and North Atlantic oscillation in North America. We use the global couple model ECHAM5-MPIOM, forced by observed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, to simulate the impact of ENA on IOD and of IODI on EAO. The ESAO is also simulated. It is found that the IODi anomaly",171,196,0.6129032258064516,7.630583624573739,0.9029333807938554,0.04431594506312893,0.8599999999999999,0.8882442748091606,0.8245850997676338,82.89267773616689,79.27741935483871,67.95677781805001

Indian summer rains (ISR) are the rainy season of India. These rainstorms are caused by the southwest mon- sion which brings moisture from the Indian ocean to India during the summer months. The onset of ISR is an important event in the agricultural calendar of the country. It is also an event of great importance for the meteorological community as it is one of only two major mono- sesonally active regions of raining in India, the other being the winter monson. This paper examines the ISRA rai- nfall in terms of its relation with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Indian Oc- ean climate (SIOC) indices. ISRS have been found to be positively correlated with both ESO and SIOC.

The Indian state of Uttarakhand is home to many ecosystems and species, including the Hindu pilgrimage site of Badrinath, which is located in a high-altitude alpine zone. The region is also subject to extreme weather events, such as the 2013 floods and the recent heat wave. These events are likely to become more frequent and severe as a result of climate-induced changes in hydrology and temperature.
In this study, the authors develop a so-called vulnerable system approach (VSA) to assess the impacts of hydro-climatic changes on soils, vegetation, and human communities in this region. They use a combination of remote sensing and field data to estimate the sensitivity of the system to changes and to identify the drivers of vulnerabilities. Their results show that the VSA is",174,184,0.5798816568047337,7.538461538461538,0.8937734901729589,0.04768039129057116,0.8933333333333334,0.8948965517241378,0.779579126908944,69.37996688741721,62.739644970414204,65.5826164874552

Farming is a predominantly male-dominated activity in India. In this study, we explored the diversities of the adaptation responses of women and men farming households to the impacts of climate variability and change in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with 10 women farmer-households and 9 men. Our results revealed that women are more vulnerable than men to climatic risks and their responses are gender-specific. Women farmed on a smaller scale, were more dependent on rainfall, and were less aware of weather forecasts and climate information. They also had less access to technology and finance. Their coping strategic choices were mainly in terms of crop diversification and cash crops, which were found to",175,193,0.588957055214724,7.51930031988439,0.8960683212822101,0.04698140361644089,0.8666666666666667,0.8676258992805759,0.8099460557201144,65.09691315401274,66.0,62.77246763137852

Assessment of reliabilities of climate model outputs is crucial for climate change impact assessment. This paper presents an approach to assess the reliablity of the regional progession of mono-seasonal climate variables. The approach is based on the concept of uncertainty in climate models. It uses a Bayesian approach based upon a Monte Carlo simulation. For the Indian summer mon-soonal climate, the results show that the seasonal mean rainfall is more reliable than the other variables considered.

This study examines the relationship between the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and surface ocean circulations in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean, the Eastern Tropics, Indian Ocean and Southern Ocean. It is found that the SAM is strongly associated with the surface wind stress in all regions, with a particularly strong relationship in winter. This is associated in turn with changes in sea level pressure and the winds in these regions. The relationship is not linear, however, but is more complex and is characterized by two dominant modes of variability. These are associated respectively with positive and negative SST anomalies in each region. In the Atlantic and Eastern Indian, these modes are also associated, respectively, positive or negative,",183,190,0.5271739130434783,7.150934873512511,0.8772324705685077,0.0542063596392739,0.8514285714285714,0.8392500000000002,0.7553981295996091,49.02027679433537,51.516304347826086,47.832330513523175

Abstract. The timing of Indian summer mon-soonal rainfall is controlled by the strength of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is linked to global climate. In this study, we reconstruct the timing and intensity of ENSO over the last 45 ka using a new multiproxy dataset from Lake Erhai, a high-elevation lake in the Himalayan–Tibet region. Our results show that Indian Summer Monsoons (ISMs) were more intense and frequent during the early Holocene, in particular from 14.6 to 9.7 ka, when the Indian ISM was more similar to present day.

The Rossy wave has been identified as the key source of interannual variabilities in the Indian monsoon rainfall. The wave is found to have a significant influence on the inter-annually fluctuations of the sea surface temperature (SST) in both the tropical Indian and western Pacific Ocean.

The present study aims to examine the relationship between deforestations, environmental degradation and climate changes with the food and nutrient security in India. The study analyses the trends of deforsest and depletion of forest cover in the country over the past three decades and examines the impact of climate variability and changes on food security and malnutritions in rural India during the same period.
It is found that deforesstion and environmental changes have adversely affected the nutritive values of food crops in different parts of the India, thereby leading to malnourishment of rural population. It is also found, however, that the Indian government has taken a number of measures to increase the production of nutriments and reduce the mal-nutrients in foods. These measures have been successful to some extent.

Challenging times for Indian Agriculture: Increasingly uncertain and changing climatic conditions, coupled with growing population, will pose new challenges for the Indian farmers and the agriculturists.
Indian agricultures are facing increasing challenging scenarios, as the climate is becoming increasingly unpredictable and unstable. The uncertainties in the weather patterns are becoming more frequent and more severe. In addition, the growing demands of the ever increasing population and food security are making the situation even more challenged. Climate change is already affecting the country, and its impacts are expected to intensify in future.

Indian climate,The Indian Ocean dipole–the unsung driver of climatic variability in East Africa,"The Indian Ocean dipole–the unsung driver of climatic variability in East Africa
The Indian ocean dipoles (IODs) are among the most prominent modes of climate variabilities in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. However, their influence on climate in Eastern Africa has remained elusive. Here, we show that the IOD is the primary driver for the observed climate anomalies in Kenya and Tanzania. We used the 100-year reanalysis dataset to show how the Indian monsoon and East African rainfall are controlled by the strength of the dipolediabatic heating. The diabatically heated air is transported towards the equator and causes the atmospheric divergence, which drives the monopole diurnal circulation. This diversion of air masses in turn modulates the rains over East and Southern Africa. Our results indicate that while the East Indian Oscillation (EIO) is a strong driver",197,191,0.6258064516129033,7.791227490354239,0.9070643208633232,0.042429956711264906,0.8733333333333334,0.8827480916030539,0.7972763311222308,82.04105463213503,72.70967741935483,74.96908602150538

The age and origin of the Indian and Ceylonese laterite deposits are discussed in the light of their palaeo-latitudes, which are estimated from the pH of samples from different parts of India and Sri Lanka. The pegmatite-bearing lateritic soils of south-eastern India, and of Sri lanka, are older than those of north-western India. This suggests that the laterities of southern India are derived from a pre-Cretaceous source area, whereas those in north India originated from an area which was much more recently uplifted.

The energy performance of buildings is influenced by the climatic conditions of the region where it is located. The climactic conditions are influenced mainly by geographical location, geomorphology, topography, vegetation, and human activities. This paper presents a life cycle assessment of an Indian resident building, located in different climatically extreme regions of India. Two different building envelope options (traditional and modern) and two different types of building construction materials (concrete and steel) are considered for the study. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate the impact of climatology on the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission of each building option. It is found that the building constructed with modern enclosure and concrete walls has the lowest energy and emission in all the climate zones.

It draws on a recent review of climate impacts in cor- als and other marine ecosystems, and synthesizes information from the cora- l ree-specific literature on resil- ience. Resilient coralls are not only those that survive disturbance events, but also those whose reproductive potential is maintained. The paper reviews the resi- lience of coralla to the effects of temperature, the most important climate factor affecting coraldiversity. Corals can tolerate temperature changes of up to 10 °C, as long as the change is gradual.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the mode shift of the meridional wind stress in a global ocean general circulation model (OGCM) with a high-resolution (0.25°) Indian ocean. The model simulates a significant change in Indian monsoon precipitation and the ocean heat content under the present day (1990) and future climate (2095) conditions. A mode-shift in winds is seen to occur in response to the change of precipitations and ocean heating. In the future, the wind-stress over the southwest Indian shelf region decreases, while the east coast of India experiences a strengthening of wind. We find that the shift is associated with the anomalous zonal wind associated to an anomalously weakened low-level jet and an intensified high level jet",201,194,0.5217391304347826,6.620127412408445,0.87196697617212,0.05801682190626633,0.86,0.8554744525547452,0.783721505364584,55.877533324265514,57.515527950310556,51.199078160243204

Climate change is one of the major concerns for the sustainable development of agricultural sector. The study aims to assess the role of weather variables and climate indices in influencing the land-productivity of Indian agricultures. A panel dataset of 23 states of India for 1990–2015 has been used for empirical analysis. Different models of land yield have been estimated by using a panel regression model. In the first stage of analysis, the effect of various weather and climatic variables on the yield of cereal crops has also been analyzed. Results of panel analysis show that the average land yields of wheat, rice, and maize have increased in the last two decades. However, there is a wide variation in yields among states.

Crop production in India is highly sensitive to the climate. In this study, we use two agri-climatic zones (ACZs) of India, viz., Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Deccan Plateau (DP), to analyze the sensitivity and response of major crops to changes in rainfall and temperature. The results show that the rainy season monsoon rains play a key role in determining the performance of cropping systems in both ACZ. However, the cropland areas are more sensitive in the DP than in IGP. Further, in Dharwar and Marathwada ACs, rabi cropped areas show a higher response to raining season rainstorms.

The summer climate of East Asia is influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Pacific OScillations (NPO), and other climate modes. We show that the summer ENSO signal is well predicted by a linear combination of EOFs of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. The NPO is related to the SST anomaly in a different region of eastern Asia. This leads to a high predictability for the NPOT (the North-Pacific–Tropics–Ocean) mode.

This paper presents a study of the potential energy savings of cool-roof concept in a building in the hot and humid climate of Chennai, India. The study is carried out using a calibration model of EnergyPlus, which is validated with measured data. A cooling load simulation is performed with the model and the results are compared with those of non-cool roof case. It is found that the cooler roof reduces the air-conditioning energy consumption by 13.5%. The energy reduction is more significant in summer season.

A comparatively content analysis of news coverage of the climate crisis in the German newspaper Die Zeit, the Indian newspaper The Hindu and the US magazine Mother Jones was conducted to examine how climate change is framed in media discourses. The study shows that while the news media in all three countries use a similar discourse of risk and crisis, there are differences in how the crisis is constructed and how solutions are discussed. In India, climate coverage is mostly about the effects of global warming on the country, while in Germany, it is more about how Germany can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

The zoogeographical patterns of the West Indies have been influenced by the Pleisocence climates, as well as by more recent climatological changes. The West India fauna is composed of species from the New World and the Old World. Many of these species have a distribution which extends from one to the other of those two worlds. This distribution is usually one of contact. Species with such a pattern are usually found on islands which are of volcanic origin. These species are found in the same distributional pattern in both the western and eastern hemispheres.

The East African-Indian Ocean (EAIO) region is one of the most active monsoon areas in the world, with a strong influence on the climate and economy of East and South Africa. It is also known as a region with significant interannual climate variability, and it is important to understand the mechanics of this variabilty.

The Indian monsoon is one of the most important components of global climate. The monopole mode is the dominant mode in its variabilities. In this study, we have found that the mono-pole mode dominates the variabilty of Indian summer mon-soonal rainfall (ISMR) over the past 200 years. However, the equator-ward propagation of ISMR vari-ability is weak during the period of 0-30°N in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hem-sphere.

The tropical rainforests of India are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world. They are also one of the largest carbon sinks on the planet. However, the forested areas of this region are under threat. The changing climate is one factor that is contributing to the loss of these forrests.
Climate change is causing an increase in temperature, which is leading to a decrease in rainfall in many parts of South Asia. This is having a negative impact on agriculture and forestry, and is also leading people to migrate to urban areas.

The relationship between lighting activity, and the projecting change of climate is studied for the first time over Indian Sub-Continent. The relationship is analysed using the lightening data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall data. A significant correlation is observed between the number of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightnings and rainy days over India. It is also found that the CG lightings are more frequent during the monsoon season and during early post mono-soonal period. In the present study, the relationship of CG and CG-IC (intra-cloud) flashes with the raining days is found to be significant. However, CG flash density and IC flash densities are not found significant over this region.

Indian climate,Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities,"Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities
Migration and urbanisation are two of the most important processes shaping contemporary India. Both processes are intricately connected to each other. However, the relationship between these processes has not been studied in a comprehensive manner. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring the ways in which migration shapes urban spaces in India, and how urban development affects migrant populations.
The paper is based on a case study of Delhi. It is argued that migration is a process that is not only intrinsically connected with urban growth, but also shapes the urban fabric in complex ways. Migrants are often marginalised and pushed to the peripheries of cities, which results in their exlusion from the mainstream urban life. The paper also argues that the process of urbanization is also uneven, with the poor and marganalised groups being the worst affected.",223,198,0.5266272189349113,6.846153846153846,0.8749951254738273,0.0561091703035452,0.9,0.8846896551724144,0.766669815411314,63.70964626245669,63.21301775147929,62.126841243862515

The Government of India (GOI) has recently made climate adaptation a priority. This has been reflected in the GOI’s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and the subsequent State Action Plans on climate (SAPCs). In 2013, the Government released the first set of SAPs for 12 states. A new paper by the ODI and SANDRP argues that while these SapC’ are a step in right direction, they need to be strengthened to ensure that climate risk is integrated into the main development planning process.

Coral cores from the central Pacific Ocean were analyzed for the period 1886-1990. The cores were from corals at depths of 45 to 60 m, at a latitude of approximately 9°N. This location is in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Corals were selected from a single species, Acropora palmata. All cores had similar growth patterns, with a high-density growth phase between ∼14 and 30 years, followed by a low-growth phase. In the high density phase, the growth rate was 2.6 mm yr- ¹, while in low density growth phases the rate decreased to as low as 0 mm year-¹.

India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The Indian economy is growing at an average rate of 7.5% in last 10 years. This growth is mainly attributed to the private sector. As a result, the Indian private companies have become one the largest employers in India.
The Indian business environment is highly competitive and complex. It is characterized by the presence of large multinational companies, small and medium enterprises, and family businesses. These business environments are also characterised by high levels of corruption and bribery. In such a complex business landscape, it is important for managers to be able to build trust with their employees and other stakeholders.

This paper explores the link between climate variabilities and human migration. We employ a panel data set for India and employ an instrumental variable approach to address the endogeneity of climate shocks. The results show that the impact of rainfall shock on migration is positive in the short run and negative in medium and long run. Rainfall shock has a negative impact on the migration outflow in all the states. However, the effect of the rainy season on in-migration is ambiguous. On the other hand, rabi shock is found to have a positive impact in both the directions of migration, while the monsoon shock and the summer season are found not to be associated with migration flows.

Climate change is a serious threat to the sustainability of agriculture in the North-Eastern Region (NER) of India. The region is prone to floods, droughts, landslides and cyclones. Climatic events are becoming more severe and frequent in recent years. It is reported that the frequency of drastic weather events in NER has increased by 50 per cent in last two decades. This is attributed to global warming. Recent studies show that Northeast India is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.

In this paper, we have examined the observed variabilities and changes in the IOD and ENSO and their impacts on monosonal variablity and rains over India during 60 years of period 01-06-1948 to 31 -12-2100. We have also examines the variabilty of Indian",232,182,0.6015037593984962,6.936879756192959,0.8960559910509477,0.04894127581421926,0.8560000000000001,0.872660550458716,0.7943134082820409,66.5,63.18045112781955,68.13013698630138

This paper examines the ways in which climate change is being understood in India, a country that is home to 1.2 billion people, and is one of the most vulnerable to climate variability and change. It draws on a qualitative study conducted in 2009 in three Indian states, which sought to understand how climate information and adaptation practices were being developed, used and disseminated. This paper focuses on the persistence of uncertainty in the face of climate uncertainty, but also explores the way inwhich uncertainty is understood and acted upon, particularly by communities. In doing so, the paper considers the extent to which communities are able to identify, articulate and respond to the uncertainty that climate science has produced. The paper concludes by considering the implications for adaptation practice, in terms of how uncertainty should be understood, how it should inform adaptation planning and what this means",234,192,0.4888888888888889,6.559132733999383,0.8621941108004147,0.061103874980851985,0.8571428571428571,0.8569230769230768,0.751364475375572,50.501668219663955,49.06666666666667,47.36919152711545
Indian climate,Climate change studies in Indian agriculture,"Climate change studies in Indian agriculture: Current status and future directions
The current status of climate change research in India is reviewed and the future research needs are identified. Climatic changes are expected to affect agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, the extent and magnitude of these changes remain uncertain. The uncertainty is due to the complexity of the problem and its inter-disciplinary nature. A review of literature on the impact of climatic change on agriculturally important crops shows that a wide range of studies have been undertaken. These studies are based on various modeling approaches, which include statistical and mechanistic models. There is a need for a more coordinated approach to study the effects of global climate changes on Indian cropping systems, especially for croplands under rainfed conditions. This is because, in rainy regions, rains are the primary source of water for crop growth, and changes in the",235,184,0.5393939393939394,6.928640603037555,0.8790999419551458,0.05452127775730662,0.8533333333333334,0.8536170212765953,0.7618907975644952,49.58661417322834,49.23030303030303,52.191324168388064

The study of environmental archaeological remains has the potential to provide insights into the way societies adapt to climate variability and change. This article examines the role of archival data and environmental remains in the study and management of climate-related risks, with a focus on the islands and atolls of two archipelagos: the Maldives in south-western India and the Lesser Antilles in north-eastern Carribean. The analysis of past environmental conditions and archives is central to understanding the resilience of societal systems to environmental change, but archived data are often not available for many small islands.

Glacial and Holocene climate variability in South Asia is still poorly understood, in part due to the lack of reliable proxy data. Here we present new proxy records from the western Himalaya (Garhwal region, India) that extend the existing database, and which allow us to reconstruct the glacial mono-soonal variabil- ity in the region. We also present results from a series of climate model experiments that shed light on the potential causes of this vari- ability. Our results show that glaciers in this region are strongly sensitive to climate variations, particularly during the last gla- cial maximum. The model results suggest that the North African-Saharan desert was drier than today during glacio-evolutionary periods, which may have enhanced the moisture transport to South Asian mon- soon regions. These results also suggest a strong influence of North American climate on South",239,192,0.615819209039548,8.192941705230835,0.9063392916758577,0.04166451164062367,0.9314285714285714,0.9275816993464053,0.8424546771442216,88.67629482071713,96.32203389830508,82.32779677576943

Abstract. We examine the robustness of the Indian monsoon in a large set of model simulations of future climate. These simulations are forced by greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols, ozone, or solar irradiance. The results are analysed using the standard climate diagnostics, such as the zonal mean zonally averaged sea surface temperature (SST) and the vertical structure of atmospheric temperature. All the analysts find a robust increase in SST in the eastern tropical Pacific and a decrease in Indian Southeast Asia. This is caused by the meridional expansion of convection in",247,182,0.6453900709219859,7.663582481705323,0.9115131076145513,0.04117164781590012,0.8799999999999999,0.8570940170940172,0.8034724976489509,75.42303534753,74.69503546099291,82.42076966610074

As per the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global temperature is expected to rise by 1.5°C between 2030 and 35. The report warns that this increase in temperature will have a significant impact on agriculture, which will affect food production and the availability of food.
In India, climate is an important factor in agricultural production. Wheat is the main crop in the country. India is self-sufficient in wheats. It is also a major exporter of wheaten products. In the last few years, there has been a decline in production of rice in some parts of India. This has led to an increase of prices of these products and a decrease in availabilty. However, wheate is still produced in large quantities in many parts. So, what is happening to the whe",249,187,0.5535714285714286,7.175105773237274,0.8845884770800294,0.0518631382467708,0.8599999999999999,0.8583333333333337,0.7664999318130532,50.547175114775605,59.29761904761905,46.348026315789475

Indian climate,The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change,"The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change and is a threat to native species in Australia. The mongooses are voracious predators of native animals, and are also a health risk to humans.
The small mammal is found in many parts of the world, but is most common in India and Sri Lanka. It was introduced to Australia in the 1930s as a means of controlling snakes, particularly cane toads, in sugarcane fields. Since then, it has spread to most parts, including the tropical north.

THE DISCOVERY OF FLORIDA
In the year 528 of our era, a Spanish fleet, commanded by the admiral Don Tristan de Luna, sailed from Cadiz, in Spain, to discover the western coast of America. The fleet consisted of nine vessels, each of one hundred tons burden, with five hundred soldiers and sailors. After a long and tedious voyage, they arrived at the mouth of a river, near the present site of St. Augustine, Florida, on the 29th of August, 627. They found the river filled with fish, which they called _ciguas_ from its resemblance to a snake. It was a beautiful country and well watered, but the inhabitants were hostile.

Climate change is one of the most significant threats to the Sundabans, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Bangladesh and India. The Sundari trees, which are the main species in this mangrove ecosystem, are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall.
The Sundars are home to a large population of people who depend on its resources for their livelihoods. Climate change could have a significant impact on their lives, as it could lead to increased flooding, droughts and storms, and changes to their way of life.

It is, therefore, not surprising that the scientific community is keen to understand the complex processes that drive the phenomenon.
The mono­sons are the result of a complex interplay between the atmospheric circulation and the heating of land and oceans. These factors are simulated by the climate models used to predict the future climate.

This paper discusses the late Quartenary vegetational and climatic history based on the evidence of pollen, macrofossils and lithology. It is concluded that the vegetal cover of this region has been very sparse during the Pleistocene and Holocen and that there has always been a desert-like environment. However, the desert has undergone a series of changes in its extent and vegetative cover since the last glacial maximum. At the present time, there is a gradual increase in vegetable cover and a change in desert type from sandy to stony. These changes have been brought about by a combination of climatological",274,198,0.5679012345679012,7.228202652129153,0.8887868217324874,0.05033375086185317,0.8466666666666667,0.8510144927536232,0.7651114252067088,54.0,51.91975308641975,47.30880583546398
Indian climate,Why is the amplitude of the Indian Ocean Dipole overly large in CMIP3 and CMIP5 climate models?,"Why is the amplitude of the Indian Ocean Dipole overly large in CMIP3 and CMIP5 climate models?
The Indian ocean dipole (IOD) is a mode of variability that is defined by the difference between the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western and eastern parts of Indian oceans. The IOD is an important mode in climate variabilities because it is known to affect the climate of many regions around the world. It is also known that the IODI is affected by ENSO.
CMIP models have been known for some time to be biased in their simulated IODi, with the models over-predicting the magnitude of IODa. This is particularly noticeable in models of CESM and MPI-ES-M. A new paper in J. Climate (Ho et al., 2014) suggests that this is because the CAMs in these models do not simulate the effect of EDS (equatorial diurnal sea-surface",275,189,0.5647058823529412,7.362863892934755,0.8887319561725952,0.049885941238523565,0.8666666666666667,0.8789041095890401,0.7800680337660382,58.65983997881253,61.33529411764706,51.33259823576584

It is also home to some of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest, which is located on the border between Nepal and China.
In this paper, we present a novel approach to understanding climate variability in this region using multi temporal modelling and statistical analysis techniques. We first use multi time series analysis to extract climate related variables from multi spectral mod is data. Then we use machine leaning algorithms like neural networks to model these variables with respect to time. Finally we apply cross validation techniques to evaluate the performance of these models.

The Indian mon-soonal rainfall regime is one of the most important weather systems in the world. It is not only the main source of rains over South Asia, but also influences the climate of large parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The Indian summer rainy season is characterized by the onset of mono-sular convection in late May or early June and the subsequent decay in July and August. This seasonal cycle is controlled by two processes: the seasonality of solar heating and a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern, known as the Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM). The ISM is a low-level atmos-pherically forced circulating system that is responsible for the transport of moisture from the tropical Indian Ocean into the Asian continent.

The study was led by Prof. Abhilash Kumar of the Department of Mathematics and the Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc).
Decadal forecasts are predictions of global climate conditions over a period of 10 years. These predictions have been made by various modelling centres across the globe for the last 25 years, and are used by decision makers to plan ahead for climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, water and energy. However, these predictions suffer from low skill (i.e. low accuracy) in many regions of our planet.

The Indian mono-seasonal summer rainfall (SMR) is a major source of uncertainty in global climate models. The Indian SMR is characterized by two peaks in rainy season: the first one in late May and the second one around mid-July. This raises the question of whether the SMF is correctly simulated in regional models, which are usually forced by global models and thus, do not explicitly simulate the two monosonals. We analyze the performance of a state-of-the-art regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In order to simulate two distinct monoso-nals, we introduce two different climatological rains and use a two-step methodology.

The role of the pre-conditioned sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in causing the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall anomaly is investigated using the coupled ocean-atmosphere model. The model is pre conditioned with the observed SST anomalous patterns of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian ocean dipole (IOD) and the North Indian low (NIL). The preconditions are applied to the model initial conditions and run for 10 years to simulate the ISM rains. It is found that the ENSO and IOD pre conditions give the most realistic simulation of ISMR, while the NIL precon-dition gives the least realis-tic simulation.

By the 21st century, the hill stations of colonial India had become a popular tourist destination. However, these places were once the sites of imperial rule, as well as of a unique form of settler colonialism. The British Hill Station is a book-length study of these sites as they were imagined, built, inhabited, administered, contested, photographed and consumed. It is the first major study to explore the cultural meanings of this distinctive form and place of British colonial rule.
The book examines the emergence of hill-station culture in the early nineteenth century and traces its development through the ninety years of its heyday, from the mid-nineteeth century to the Second World War.

Climate change has been a major concern for farming communities. The study was conducted to assess the awarness of Indian farmer about the climate changes and their adaptation measures. A survey was carried out in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. 400 farms were selected through multistage random sampling method. Data were collected through structured questionnaire. Results indicated that majority of the farmland was rain fed. Farmers were aware of climate variability and change. They were also aware about adaptation strategies. However, the adoption of these adaptation techniques was very low. Majority of them were not aware regarding the government schemes and extension services. Therefore, there is need for creating awreness among farners regarding climate related issues and its adaptation.

European climate policies are increasingly framed in terms of the role of emerging economies, particularly China. This is not only due to the fact that China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, but also because China’ s economic growth is largely based on a high energy consumption, and because the country is often regarded as a major threat to EU climate ambitions.
This framing of climate policy is, however, problematic. It is problematical because it overlooks the European contribution to climate change. Europe’ is responsible for approximately 10% of global green house gas emissions, while China accounts for 23% and the USA 40%.

A global sustainable ocean data system would provide the information needed to address many of today’s global issues, such as climate change, food security, and marine pollution. The Indian ocean is the third largest ocean basin in terms of area and has a diverse range of climatic and oceanographic conditions. It is also the only oceanic region that has been subject to major climate changes during the last century, which have had a significant impact on the region’ s socio-economic development. As such, the establishment of a sustaining ocean monitoring system for the entire Indian region is of utmost importance.

Climate change has been identified as one of the major factors for the increase in the frequency of tropical cyclone (TC) activity in recent years. The present study aims to assess the impact of global warming on TC activity over Indian Ocean. A high-resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean model, COSMO-CLM, has incorporated the oceanic component with a higher resolution of 1/12°. This model is used to simulate the TCDD (Tropical Cyclone Days over the Indian sub-continent) and TCFDs (Total Cyclonic Frequency Days) over India.

African monitors are the key to understanding the evolution of the mono-seasonal Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) over the past 60 years. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is the dominant driver of climate change in the tropical Indian ocean, and it is a major driver in ISM evolution. However, there is no direct relationship between IOD and ISMI. This study investigates the relationship of ISMO with IODI and the role of Africa in monosonal climate changes over India.
The results show that the ISMC is positively correlated with the IODC, which is not directly related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian winter monies. In addition, the African monit is an important factor in determining the strength of monolithic rainfall over eastern India and",327,185,0.577922077922078,7.1718243798258845,0.8911412760924642,0.04976351669295753,0.86,0.8763076923076925,0.7791099448974181,70.51933895921238,68.24025974025975,64.54813664596273

India is a vast country, with a wide range of climates and cultures. The climate of the country is influenced by the monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean. There are four main climatic regions in the subcontinent: the hot and humid coastal plains, the cool and wet Himalayas, and the arid and semi-arid deserts.
The climate in rural India is often much hotter and more humdrum than in urban areas. This is because there is less greenery and vegetation, which helps to cool the air. In addition, rural areas are often located in valleys or other low-lying areas, where the heat can build up during the day. As a result, many rural households in india are forced to rely on traditional methods of cooling, such as shade and fans. However, as the climate becomes more extreme",329,186,0.5481927710843374,7.062969783927628,0.8824081146655184,0.05296673885742811,0.8466666666666667,0.8414084507042254,0.7569053025583995,49.28386660829511,48.57831325301205,43.994442099338684

Global climate model (GCM) simulations for the twentieth century (1901-2005) were used to assess the performance of the models in simulating the seasonal and annual mean temperature and rainfall over India. The performance was assessed using the multiobjective analysis of variance (MOANOVA) approach. In this study, the objective functions were constructed by considering the spatial pattern of rainy days, temperature, and precipitation in the Indian monsoon region. For each objective function, a weighting factor was assigned to each variable. This weighted objective was used in MOANVA to rank the GCMs. Weighting factors were selected based on the relative importance of each climatic variable for Indian agriculture.

Indian climate,Climate Change and its Impacts on Indian Agriculture.,"Climate Change and its Impacts on Indian Agriculture.
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges that we face today. It is caused by an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, which traps heat and causes global warming. The earth's climate is changing at a faster rate than ever before, and this is having a significant impact on agriculture in India. Climatic changes have caused a decline in crop yields, increased frequency and severity of droughts, floods, heat waves, cyclones, etc. This has led to an increased demand for food security and adaptation measures. In this blog post, we will discuss how climate change has affected Indian agricultural practices and what can be done to mitigate its effects.

The Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) is the most dominant mon-soonal system of the world, and the largest source of water vapour in
the atmosphere. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) modulates the strength of ISM, which in turn influences the Asian Summer
Monsoonic rainfall (ASMR). The IOD-ASM relationship is important for the prediction of climate change in Asia.
In this study, we investigate the correlation between the IODI and ASMR during 1960-2012. We find that the relationship
between IODi and AMR is highly correlated during this period (r=0.91).

The study was conducted in a semi-arid region of India, where climate is becoming unpredictable. The study aimed to assess the adaptive capacity of farming communities in the face of climate variability and change. A total of 320 farmer households from 16 villages were selected. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and focus group discussions. Results indicate that farms are adapting to the changing climate by adopting new technologies and management practices, which are mostly supported by the government. Farmers are also adopt-ing diversification strategies to cope with the uncertainties in climate. It was observed that the far-mers are not willing to invest in new and improved technological options.

Soil carbon (C) is an important component of soil organisms, and is the most important C pool in terrestrial ecosystems. The C dynamics in the soil are influenced by climatic factors, such as temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, evaporation, radiation, wind speed, humidity, etc. In addition, the landforms and their land uses also influence soil C.

South India is one of the most water-stressed regions in the world, with a rapidly growing population and a climate that is becoming increasingly variable. To understand how climate and land use change will affect water availabilities in this region, we developed a hydrological model for the Kaveri River basin in south India, which is the largest basins in southern India. We used the model to simulate the effects of climate, land cover and population change.
The model was calibrated using a 20-year simulation, and then used to project the hydrologic impact of a range of plausible future land and water use scenarios. In the future, the climate is likely to become warmer and drier, but the exact nature of this change is uncertain. Using the uncertainty in climate projections, it was possible to assess the range and likelihood of hydro-climatic conditions that might be expected in future.",340,193,0.45263157894736844,6.239095750946101,0.8489283134581485,0.06629575329192372,0.8914285714285713,0.8787951807228909,0.7356836751421458,51.274927984928276,52.142105263157895,48.043904049295776

The Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) are a key feature of the South Asian summer climate, providing the majority of rainfall to the region. In recent years, the ISM has become more active, with an increased number of extreme rainy days and more frequent heavy rains. These changes are likely related to a shift to more moisture-rich atmospheric circulation patterns. However, it remains unclear whether the observed changes in ISMA are linked to changes of ISMC. Here we show that the frequency of synopses with ISMS-like features has declined over the last 60 years. The polewards shift of these synopse is associated with a weakening of an atmosphric circulatry pattern, which has a large impact on the Indian monnsoonal rainstorms.

The Indian state of Uttarakhand is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in India, with a high degree of dependence on agriculture and livestock. In this context, the research project aims to contribute to climate adaptation and food security in smallholder farming in Tehrigarhwali villages by promoting agro-ecological practices.
India is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The country is affected by the consequences of climate warming: more frequent and intense droughts, floods and landslides, as well as increasingly unpredictable rainfall patterns. Agriculture is particularly affected. Untimely rains, late frosts and hailstorms destroy crops, reduce yields and reduce farmers' incomes. At the same time, farmer' s dependence is increasing: in 2018, 66",357,197,0.6114649681528662,7.661634090889173,0.9027148535064967,0.044303092988227745,0.8533333333333334,0.859849624060151,0.8128714662306649,78.5,69.71974522292993,71.48575078616352

The Indian mon-soonal region is known to experience drastic climatic variations due to its unique geography and seasonal variability. The present study is aimed at investigating the impact of anthropogenic forcing on Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) using the outputs of 20th century climate model simulations from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 05). The results of the study show that the models are able to simulate the ISM variabilities and the modelled ISMS drifts are in agreement with the observed ISMM drift. However, the simulated ISMP drifting is not in accordance with that of ISMA drifters. Further, it is found that ISMD variabil-ity is more sensitive to the anthro-pogenically induced forcing as compared to ISMC vari-ability and this is in line with findings of earlier studies",363,193,0.6329113924050633,7.9555728417573,0.9096461707770891,0.04109500738383397,0.8933333333333332,0.8788059701492544,0.8131905080877436,68.68036142078358,78.18987341772151,55.31469102792632

Abstract. The Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) is the most important source of rainfall over the Indian subcontinent. Regional climate models are used to study the mono-seasonal precipitation variability. In this study, the performance of the Regional Climate Model (RCMT2) over India in the simulation of ISM is evaluated. To understand the role of different forcings in monosonal precipitations, two simulations are performed with different forcing data. First simulation is forced by the observed sea surface temperature (",384,193,0.6054421768707483,7.340596279696671,0.8994483527588337,0.04639451991133984,0.8720000000000001,0.8481300813008137,0.8031853268592767,57.77824229589601,68.06802721088435,57.495262201453784

The paper presents an analysis of extreme wave conditions over Indian ocean for the period 1989-2006. The extreme values of significant wave hights (SWH) and mean wave period (Mwp) are estimated using the wavelet analysis. It is found that the SWH and Mwp are significantly correlated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Moreover, the analysis shows that ENSO events have significant impact on extreme S and S' wave parameters over eastern Indian region.

Indian climate,Climatic oscillations and tuna catch rates in the Indian Ocean: a wavelet approach to time series analysis,"Climatic oscillations and tuna catch rates in the Indian Ocean: a wavelet approach to time series analysis
The Indian ocean is a vast area with a great diversity of fishing grounds. The tunas are an important group of pelagic fishes that are exploited by commercial and artisanal fisheries, and they are also of interest to scientists because of their ecological role and their economic value. However, tune catches are variable and difficult to predict.
Tuna are highly migratory and pelagiic species that have a large distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. They are important to the economy of the countries that exploit them, but their catch is highly variable. This variability is due to several factors, such as environmental factors (temperature, salinity, etc.), the fishers' behaviour, or the presence of other species in their habitat. In this paper, we analyse the relationship between the catch rate of tunes and climatic factors in order to improve the knowledge of these factors.

Solar activity has a profound influence on weather and climate. The sun is the main source of energy for the earth’s climate system. It is also the source for many atmospheric processes such as cloud formation, precipitation, atmos-pherically induced circulation and solar radiation.
The sun’ s radiation is a major component of the energy budget of our planet. However, its role in the climate is not well understood. This is because the sun has an irregular and highly variable activity. Therefore, there are many solar cycles which are closely related to the global climate of Earth. These solar activity cycles have a direct impact on the weather, climate and other atmosph-eric parameters. Sol-ar cycles are characterized by the variation of solar magnetic activity, which is related with the solar wind and the Sun’ magnetic field.

Climate change is the change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years). Climatic change may be a reference to a change within the average weather conditions, or in average climate conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.) in a region.
The climate change that is occurring now is of a natural origin and is not due to any anthropogenic activity. The climate is changing in response to natural forces and has always been changing. It is now changing at an accelerated rate. Climatologists are not sure whether this change will be beneficial or detrimental to the world. However, the fact that the climate has been relatively stable for the last few thousand years is a good indication that it is more likely to be detrimental.

Climate change is a global phenomenon which is affecting forest ecosystems. Forest fringes are most vulnerable to climate change because of their proximity to human settlements, which are more prone to the impacts of climate variability. The aim of this study was to assess the perceptual differences in climate changes and their impact on forest-fringe people and to identify their response to such changes.
This study used a survey methodology to collect data from forest dwellers of the Eastern Indian Hindu Kush Himmalaya. A total of 138 respondents from 25 villages were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was carried out to find the difference in percep-tions of climatic changes among respondent groups and the association between per",398,196,0.5506329113924051,6.921348372328851,0.882138130646484,0.053606299069027676,0.8533333333333334,0.8632835820895516,0.7837519966603612,55.88238705905994,62.37341772151899,50.230769230769226
Indian climate,"Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries. Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey","Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries. Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey
In the past few decades, developing countries have experienced rapid economic growth. This growth has been accompanied by increasing energy consumption, which is largely responsible for rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2005, the global GHg emitted by developing nations was 42% of the total. By 1990, their share was only 31%. The rapid growth in GDP in developing economies has led to an increase in energy demand.
The effects of climate change in the developing world are numerous. For example, in China alone, it is estimated that more than 80 million people will be affected by climate-related disasters. Climatic changes will also impact agriculture and forestry. It will cause a decrease in crop yields and a rise in food prices. As a result, there will likely be a negative impact on the health and well-",399,191,0.5722222222222222,7.677166722749278,0.8925028882986232,0.04766479946797061,0.8571428571428571,0.8571794871794872,0.7831900037093267,69.27143187306243,59.53333333333333,57.8781862745098

Sustainable fishing, marine conservation and food systems are key for a blue and green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Indian ocean is a hotspot for fish production and marine biodiversity. However, unsustained fish stocks, overfishing and poorly managed fishery resources are threatening the livelihoods of millions of people.
The Indian oceans’ fishermen and women are among the most vulnerable to the impacts and risks of climate variability and change. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry and temperature, and increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including cyclones, floods and droughts. These impact fish, fishers, communities and the environment. While there is growing awareness of the need to tackle climate-related impact, there are still significant knowledge gaps and limited resources for ocean climate resilience.

The objective of this study is to assess the sensitivity of the indicative climate sensitive indications with respect to the vulnerabilty index. For this purpose, we have used the data of 1330 watersheds of Indian states of Haryana and Rajasthan. In the present study, four climate indices, viz. temperature, rainfall, runoff and evaporation, have being used to determine the impact of climate on agriculture. These indices have then been used for determining the overall vulnerablity index for the watersheeds. A sensitvity analysis has been carried out for these climate indicies.

A study on the implications for water management of the impacts of global warming on rainfall and runoff in the Indian Himalayan region was carried out. The study is based on a hydrological model that simulates the seasonal variations in runoffs of 109 major rivers in 22 states and 6 union territories of India. It is found that the average run off in most of these rivers will increase in response to climate warmi ng. However, the increase is not uniform and will be greater in some rivers than in others. In addition, a number of rivers may experience a decrease in average annual run-off. These variations are attributable to the complex topography of Indian rivers and their catchments. This study has important implicat ions for the management and development of water and energy resources in this region.

Climate change is arguably the most pressing environmental issue of the twenty-first century. This article compares newspaper reporting of climate issues in twenty seven countries over a six-year period. It focuses on the extent to which the media frame climate as a social problem and the level of attention given to climate stories. The results show that the framing of global warming as an issue is highly variable across countries, and that countries with high levels of framed attention also tend to have high rates of actual attention. However, the findings also indicate that frames do not always predict the attention that climate receives in the news. We find that there is no consistent relationship between the degree of media framings and attention to the issue. Countries that frame global climate war as social issue are not necessarily more likely to report on it. Instead, media attention is determined by a combination of",412,195,0.53125,7.361215932167729,0.8796912761713852,0.0526906928950963,0.8914285714285713,0.8866666666666655,0.7862670569312714,65.6007696007696,64.81770833333333,58.78614678288642

India is one of few countries in which hydraulic power generation has the potential to increase under the influence of climate changes. This study assesses the impact of future climatic changes on the hydroelectric power production of 16 large rivers of North India. The results show that the power potential of these rivers will increase significantly under all climate conditions. In the best case, the increase will be 24.5% and in worst case it will decrease by 7.7%. The increase is expected to be maximum in winter months and minimum in summer months. However, there is no significant change of hydro power in monsoon season.

This study aims to understand the vulnerabilities of coasts to climate change and to identify the most vulnerable coastlines of India. A coastline is defined as vulner- able if it is exposed to both sea level rise (SLR) and climatic extrem- es. The study area is the Indian mainland coast, which is divided into 30 coast districts. For each coast district, a vulnera- bility index is calculated based on the combination of SLR and extreme climate indices.
The vulnerabil- ity index for each district is then compared with other districts using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test.

Indian agricultural economy is one of the most important sectors of Indian economy. It is the largest source of income for the farmers of India. Agriculture sector has been a major contributor in India’s economic development and growth. The Indian agriculturists are very much dependent on the monsoon. A major portion of agricultures in the country is rain-fed. Hence, agriculturer’ face a lot of challenges due to climate changes. Climate change has a significant impact on Indian Agricultural sector. This paper aims to study the impact of climatic changes on India agriculturation sector from the year 82 to the present.

The Indonesia Through Flow (ITF) is a major ocean current that transports heat from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. The ITF is strongly influenced by seasonal and interannal variations in the strength of the trade winds. In this study, we investigate the impact of inter-annually varying ITCZs on the ITP over a 26-year period (1986–2011) using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. We find that the intermittency of trade-wind-induced ITVs is not directly related to changes in surface wind stress. Instead, it is associated with changes of air-sea fluxes, which are governed by oceanic and atmospheric processes. Intermitentcy is controlled by a combination of processes that are associated to ocean-atmosphere coupling, such as ocean dynamics, ocean mixed layer depth, surface",424,191,0.5748502994011976,7.4287030323277135,0.891823702559835,0.04866850938676575,0.8466666666666667,0.8674125874125876,0.8004627365969176,57.7283950617284,68.40718562874251,66.80297619047619

Indian climate,Migration as adaptation strategy to cope with climate change: A study of farmers' migration in rural India,"Migration as adaptation strategy to cope with climate change: A study of farmers' migration in rural India
Migration is increasingly being seen as an adaptation to climate-related stresses, and it is argued that migration can play a role in enhancing adaptation. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this claim. This paper examines the migration decisions of households in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The data come from a survey of 147 households from three villages, with a focus on the impact of climate on migration. A multinomial logistic regression analysis is conducted to identify the factors that affect migration to different places. It is found that households are more likely to migrate to the urban areas of the state. Migrants are found to be better off than non-migrants in terms of income and assets. Further, it was found from the regression results that the main drivers of migration are income, age, caste and gender.

The country is now one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and, in 2018, it was the sixth largest economy in purchasing power parity terms. This growth has led to a significant increase in urbanisation and income inequality. In 73% of Indian households, the head of household is a woman, but only 4.5% are women’ leaders, and 90% live in rural areas.

Abstract. Regional Climate Models (RCMS) are useful for providing sub-regionally specific information on the climate, particularly for the mono-seasonal monosonous regions. However, the uncertainty associated with down-scalings of RCMs is not well understood. In this study, we use the 50-km resolution MRI-AGCM2.0 model to investigate the role that domain scale plays on RSM downscalling uncertainty.

Ashok Kumar, Ramesh K.S.
Safety climate has been used as a tool to measure safety attitudes in various industries. The present study is an attempt to develop a safety attitude scale to assess safety-related attitudinal constructs among officers of Indian ships. A scale consisting of 28 items was developed after conducting a literature survey and a pilot study. Data were collected from 156 officers from Indian vessels and analysed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analaysis. Factor analysis revealed that the scale consists of three factors namely safety precautions, safety rules and safety measures. Convergent validity was established using a set of safety related variables. Further, a good correlation was found between safety rule scores and accident rates. Internal consistency of the scales was also found to be high. It is concluded that",438,186,0.5337423312883436,6.814365914895229,0.8767426635776644,0.055717397646094076,0.8533333333333334,0.8492086330935258,0.7722673697104452,50.38468992248062,53.66257668711656,48.68842625264644

Climate modes are important in understanding the variabilities of oceanic processes. In this study, the effects of three climate indices (Southern Oscillation Index, Indian Summer Monsoon Index and El Niño-South Oceans Index) on the inter-annually variableness of equatorward surface current in Indian ocean are investigated. The results show that the variations of Indian summer monsoons and the El Nino-south oceania index are the main factors that control the surface curren variabilty in equitorial Indian ocaean. While the Southern Ocillations Index has no significant effect on this current.

The climates of the Indian subcontinent have been described by various scholars since the 19th century, but most of these classifications were based on the work of two pioneers: Sir John Eliot Howard and Sir George King. In this paper, we present a revised climatalogy for India, based upon an analysis of daily temperature and precipitation data from 235 weather stations across the country. We describe the development of a new classification system, and compare the performance of our new system with that of Howard's and King' s. Our results show that the new climatolgy is more consistent with the observed climate of each of 650 districts in the sub-continet.

The study has been conducted for three different future periods, i.e. 1981-2100, using the A1B scenario. In the study, the future wind speed is predicted using two different methods. One is based on statistical downscaling of the global circulation models (GCMs) and the other is by applying the statistical relationships between wind and temperature. It has also been observed that the mean wind is higher in the northern region as compared to the southern region of Indian coast.

The Indian mono-soonal (IM) rains are the second largest source of rainy season precipitation in the Indian sub-continent, with about 50% of the raining season raindrop falling during the IM season. The IM rainstorms are one of most important sources of monetary losses in India, and are a key component of agricultural productivity in many parts of India. It is therefore important to understand the nature of Indian IM precipitations and their variability under different climate scenarios.
In the present study, we have used the outputs of 12 different global climate models (GCMs) to examine the changes in IM rain precipitations in a warming world. We have analysed the precipitative responses to climate forcing in 20 and 40 years from now, as well as in doubled CO2 conditions.

The Indian subcontinent is the world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its rate of emission is increasing. This is in part due to the extensive area of the Hindu Kush Hajar (HKH) region, which is characterized by high elevations, cold temperatures, and high rainfall. The HK region is also a biodiversity hotspot, hosting a large number of endemic species. In addition, the region has a high proportion of soil carbon (C) relative to total organically-bound C (TOC), and therefore, it is a significant source of atmospheric CO2.
In this study, we assess the role of climate and soil characteristics on the amount of C stored in soils, focusing on both the potential for C to be released to atmosphere as CO₂ and the storage of new C in soil. We use a range of different methods",460,196,0.5555555555555556,7.637626158259733,0.8878643583497265,0.04925874066707587,0.8857142857142858,0.8736969696969693,0.7873248976491147,73.46650263901805,63.97883597883598,55.4713963963964

The impact of climate change on water-borneo diarrohea (WBD) in India is not well understood. This study investigates the relationship between climate and WBD in the northern part of the country, and proposes adaptation measures to reduce the risk of WBD. The study was conducted in three districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. A multivariate time series analysis was used to assess the impacts of temperature and rainfall on WDB. Adaptation strategic planning was carried out by applying the MARTIN model to determine the effectiveness of adaptation options in reducing the incidence of diaroheal disease.

Four climate scenarios of the future Indian mon-soonal rainfall distribution are presented based on the coupled regional atmospheric‐oceanic model (COSMO-CL) for 2050 and 55 years later, 100 years from now. The model simulations are forced by global warming and two different global scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8. 6). The results show that the mono-soual rains will be less intense over the entire region in the year 3015, but the seasonal cycle will not change significantly. For the high-emission scenario RPC8,6, the summer rainy season will shift to the north and to a lesser extent to south.

Abstract. A multi model downscaling approach has been used to produce a set of climate projection datasets for India over the period 2021–22 to 3070–79. The prognostic variables used for the downscale are mean annual temperature and annual total precipitation. These variables are derived from the outputs of 11 GCMs and three RCMs. In addition, the RCP4.5 and RPC8. 5 scenarios of the IPCC AR5 have been considered.
The down scaled datasets are validated with the observations of station data from 600 stations and satellite data of precipitable water from CMORPH. Both the station and the satellite datasets have shown good agreement",464,180,0.5815602836879432,6.905645752745456,0.8904693993806813,0.05096297533106928,0.8639999999999999,0.8341880341880347,0.7957058935263235,47.0,51.723404255319146,49.073997519636215

This study investigates the causes of the Indian ocean warmer than normal (WON) event during the period 29 May to 9 August 5 in 88. The results show that the warmed Indian oceans are mainly caused by the anomalous heating of tropical Indian and the surrounding ocean regions. It is suggested that anomalously heated tropical Indo-Pacific ocean region and anomaly of low-level zonal winds may play an important role in the WON event.

In tropical regions, the thermal environment is characterized by high temperatures and high humidity. The human body has a limited ability to dissipate heat, and it is therefore necessary to provide cooling for thermal well-being. In this paper, a thermal discomfort model has been developed to predict the disconfort level experienced by a person in a tropical environment. This model is based on the psychophysiological and physiologically equivalent temperature concepts. A new method has also been proposed to determine the appropriate value of the equivalent thermal resistance (ETR) of a human. It is found that the physio-equivalent temperature (PET) is higher than the thermophy-siological equivalent temperate (TET), and the PET is also higher in the evening than in mornings. An ETR value (0.124) has therefore",468,192,0.4941860465116279,6.481189239135698,0.8630706213482976,0.061251458840132195,0.88,0.8694594594594595,0.7712444326696293,57.333333333333336,55.03488372093023,51.47662065476621

Natural disasters, such as floods, droughts and heat waves, cause large mortalties. In the Indian state of Kerala, mortaility in the summer of 2018 was 12% higher than in other summers. The main cause of this increase was the heat wave.
Heat waves are becoming more frequent in many parts of the world. According to the IPCC, extreme heat events will become more common in Europe and North America. However, the impact of heat on human health is highly unequally distributed. While heat has a negative effect on the health of all people, it is especially problematic for the elderly and children. Those who live in urban areas are more likely to suffer from heat than those living in rural areas.

India's manufactured exports have been growing at a faster rate than the global growth in the past decade. The share of manufactures in GDP has increased from 16.5 percent in 2004-05 to 30 percent by 4Q 09. This paper examines the role of investment and investor-specific factors in explaining the growth of India' s manufacture exports. We find that investments in infrastructure and human capital are positively associated with the export growth. Further, the level of domestic investors' participation in investing in exporting firms is found to be positivity associated. However, we find no significant association between the investee fir''s foreign ownership and export performance.

Climate change is a global phenomenon which has been changing the face of the earth for millions of years. The earth's climate has undergone many changes in the past, which have been caused by natural forces like solar radiation, volcanic eruptions, and plate tectonics. However, the current climate changes are caused primarily by the increase in greenhouse gases in atmosphere. These gasses trap heat in earth’s atmosphere and thus, result in increase of global temperature. Climate change will have a significant impact on the biosphere, especially on plants and animals. It is important to understand the impact of this phenomenal on natural resources and bioresources.

Climate change will affect India in a variety of ways, from increased risks of droughts and floods to higher temperatures and more intense rainfall events. India will also be affected by sea level rise, which will increase the severity of coastal flooding and erosion. The impacts of climate change on India are likely to be more severe than the impact of the economic reforms of 1991.
The authors assess the vulnerabilities to climate impact and the adaptive capacity of India. They analyse the potential impact on the economy, the health of Indians, agriculture, fisheries and forestry, as well as the wider environment and biodiversity. Based on this analysis, they identify a range of adaptation strategies that will help India to cope with the effects",479,188,0.5408805031446541,6.8202436371760395,0.8787594159507806,0.055074381041832765,0.8066666666666666,0.8328888888888899,0.7495172992317815,39.75,44.9622641509434,39.372549019607845

Indian climate,Climate change and rice yields in diverse agro-environments of India. I. Evaluation of impact assessment models,"Climate change and rice yields in diverse agro-environments of India. I. Evaluation of impact assessment models.
Rice is the staple food of over half of the world's population. The impacts of climate change on rice production in India are expected to be severe due to the large share of rice in the total food grain production and the high vulnerability of this crop to temperature and rainfall extremes. To assess the impact of projected climate changes on the rice yield, impact models have been used. This paper presents an evaluation of five impact modeling studies conducted in different agrocenoses of india. These studies were conducted at different time periods, using different methods and models and hence the results are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, the paper highlights the similarities and differences in impact results and suggests the need for a standardized impact study protocol.",483,193,0.5189873417721519,6.523569730240986,0.8704467212004986,0.05892382198579154,0.8333333333333334,0.8211940298507461,0.7410530098008833,46.62691131498471,46.765822784810126,43.24720251590726

The impact of climate on hydroclimatic variables, such as precipitation and temperature, is an important aspect of hydro-climatological research. However, the uncertainty in hydrogeological parameters, which is another important factor affecting the hydroenvironment, has been rarely considered in the literature. In this study, we use a Bayes' theorem-based method to quantify the parameter uncertainties in an integrated hydroeconomic model (IHEM) and assess the impacts of the unmeasured hydro geological parameter variations on the river discharge of major Indian rivers. The results show that the IHEMS can capture the overall trends in river flow, but it is unable to accurately reproduce",484,181,0.6024096385542169,7.7615052570633285,0.9008570396973916,0.0446568168625219,0.8333333333333334,0.8335211267605632,0.7944866749464762,70.51643856045663,59.69879518072289,46.376480137509546

Climate change is evident in many parts of the world, but in tropical regions, where a large fraction of global warming is expected to occur, the evidence is less conclusive. Here, we present a new analysis of satellite-based out-going radiation (OLR) data from 1979 to 2010 in order to investigate the recent trends in surface temperature and atmospheric circulation in two tropical ocean regions. The western tropical Pacific (WTP) and the Indian (IO) Ocean have been selected as representative regions for the study because of their geographical location and because the two regions have different seasonal cycles. We find that the WTP has experienced a cooling trend of −0.15 ± 03 K decade−1, whereas the IO has warmed at a rate of ∼0·11 K per de",487,184,0.5914634146341463,7.574427451597394,0.8970256463079823,0.046492827827472244,0.8733333333333332,0.8751428571428578,0.8225144928208675,67.74628877383132,80.34146341463415,70.25597402597401

The Indian Walker Circulation (IWC) is a major source of moisture for the East African region, and it has been identified as a key factor in the precipitation regime of Kenya. This study investigates the representation of IWW in coupled atmosphere-ocean models. The results show that the IWM is well represented in models with both ocean and atmosphere components. However, the model results indicate that most models have problems in reproducing the strength of Walker convection. In models where the Walker cell is represented well, precipitable water (PW) anomalies are generally associated with the position of convec-tive activity in a given model. For the couple models, PW anomaly patterns are related to the location of low-level convergence in their model, which is associated to anomalous Walker-cell con-vective intensity.

India has been an active participant in climate change negotiations and has also contributed to the research on climate science and mitigation and adaptation. However, there is a lack of consensus on the country’s climate policy objectives and strategies. This paper presents a conceptual framework to examine the Indian climate research landscape and analyses the gaps and challenges. The analysis suggests that the climate-related research in the public domain is primarily conducted by governmental agencies and academic institutions. While some of the agency-led research is policy relevant, it is not systematic or integrated. There is no clear-cut division between research conducted in South and North India, but the latter has a stronger focus on adaptation and local-level miti-gation.

The study area was divided into 164 cells",499,184,0.6268656716417911,7.256494774883425,0.9046471464598987,0.04482752970770546,0.8640000000000001,0.8712727272727272,0.8151983686312132,69.27118644067797,67.41044776119404,70.88372652864709

This paper shows that the relationship of the Pacific Decadal Ocillation (PDO) and El Nino Southern Oclution (ENSO) with the monson is not as strong as the one with Atlantic Multi-decadal Osilltion (AMO).
The authors find that AMO is a strong predictor of Indian monoson, and that it is stronger than the PDO and ENSO. The authors use Bergn climate models to explore the reason. They find the AO is the main cause of AMA. In addition, they",500,198,0.5562913907284768,6.835823053677739,0.8831113557453256,0.053643818673657445,0.8266666666666667,0.8207874015748036,0.7573719761879537,44.35162777297609,43.05960264900662,42.06418475322468
