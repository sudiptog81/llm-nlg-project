Indian climate,Impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: a review,"Impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: a review
J. K. Srivastava, S. B. Singh, and A. R. Saxena
Agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy. It is responsible for the livelihood of about 60% of the total population of India. The impact of climatic changes on agricultural production is very significant. Climatic change is a natural phenomenon, but it is being aggravated by human activities. Increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased the atmospheric temperature. This temperature rise is causing changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. These changes are affecting agriculturally important crops and livestock.

Climate change is a global phenomenon, but the impacts are experienced locally. As a result, the governance of climate change and its mitigation and adaptation has been decentralised to the sub-national level. This has raised questions about the relationship between science and governments, and how science can be used to support policy decisions.
In India, climate science is being used by the government to make decisons about how to adapt to climate impact. However, there are concerns about whether the science being produced is reliable and relevant to policy. In this blog, Dr Mithika Mumba and Dr Katie Willis, from the University of East Anglia, discuss the challenges of using science to inform climate policy in India. They suggest that the way climate is governed is also an important factor in determining the extent to which science informs policy, as well as the capacity of",1,193,0.4945054945054945,6.671243849949911,0.8646817617480632,0.059873435401780535,0.84,0.8344303797468353,0.7282631751484483,40.25789791507755,41.23076923076923,42.648989898989896

Increasing trends in water stress and water scarcity are some of the major issues that are affecting the water resources of India.
By: Shashank Shekhar | Published: July 27, 1998 5:00 am
Water is a precious resource. It is an essential requirement for the survival of all life forms. Water is required for drinking, agriculture, industry, and for recreational purposes. The water available on the earth is limited and its availability is affected by a number of factors. One of these factors is climate. Climate is the average of weather conditions over a long period of time. Thus, climate is defined as the typical weather patterns of a particular region. In a region, the climate varies from place to place. For example, in India, there are different types of climates in different regions. Similarly, climatic",2,190,0.5178571428571429,6.712195723350998,0.8715728948537002,0.05771202511081822,0.8333333333333334,0.7988888888888899,0.7379321846553593,33.81272659082386,38.99404761904762,35.70834117868574
Indian climate,Fractal dimensional analysis of Indian climatic dynamics,"Fractal dimensional analysis of Indian climatic dynamics
The Indian monsoon is an important driver of the Indian economy and the livelihood of over 1.2 billion people. It is also a complex system, whose dynamics are difficult to predict, because of its dependence on several external and internal factors. In this work, we use fractals to study the dynamics of monetary and climatological time series. We use the Hurst exponent, which is a measure of long range dependence, to quantify the nonlinearity of these time-series. The Hurts exponent is related to the fd-dimension of a time serie, and we find that the monitory time scale and that of climatoligical time scales have fracional dimensions of 0.89 and 2.02, respectively.

The Indian Building Code (IBC) 2005 recommends a minimum U-value of 1.2 W/m2K for windows. However, the energy performance of the windows depends on the thermal insulation of other components of building envelope. A study was conducted to evaluate the performance in terms of heat transfer coefficient (U-Value) of various glazing systems (single glazed, double glaze, triple glazes and laminated glasses) under different climatic conditions of India. The results show that the triple-glazed windows have the highest U value (0.47 W/(m.K)) and the single-glass windows the lowest (15.14 Wm-2. K-1) among the different window types.

Reference evaporative fraction (Et) is an important input parameter for estimating crop water requirement. The accuracy of various reference Et equations (REEs) was evaluated for the period 1980-2010 across different agro-climatic regions of India. It was found that the REEs could not predict the actual Et across all the regions. A new equation was proposed by regressing the observed Et on the available meteorological data.

India is among the top ten emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the world. Its per capita emissions are among lowest in Asia. The country’s emitting sectors are power generation, industry and transport. India’ policy response to climate action has been limited to the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol and the Joint Implementation (JI) mechanism under EU Emission Trading Scheme.
In 2008, the Indian government set up a National Climate Change Council (NCCC) to develop a national climate policy. In 1997, India had ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climatic Change (UNFCC) and in 8010 it had signed the Proto-Climate Change Agreement (PCCA",9,180,0.6363636363636364,7.6098022910645255,0.9089261991021899,0.0422550355558125,0.944,0.9109243697478983,0.8218550563749685,81.85955121894159,82.9020979020979,79.69305555555556

Water is a major requirement for human life and is the basic need for all living organisms. Water scarcity is becoming a serious problem worldwide. Solar still is one of the oldest and cheapest methods for water purification. Passive solar distillation (PSD) and solar-assisted distiller (SAD) are the two major types of solar water distilling systems. The performance analysis of a PSD and SAD system has been carried out for a month in different climates of India.
The PESD system was constructed at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, Mumbai, India, for the purpose of studying the performance under different climate conditions. A 100 L SASD was also constructed for performance comparison. Both the systems were operated in the same climatological conditions and were subjected to the following tests:

The monetary cost of the 2010 floods in Pakistan is estimated to be 3.2 billion USD. This is a devastating price to pay for the lives lost and the infrastructure destroyed. However, the cost is much higher when considering the human and economic impact of future flooding. The current mono-cropping, irrigation practices, and urbanization patterns of Pakistan are unsustainable. As a result, climate change and increasing flood frequency will have a large impact on the economy and society of this region.

Climate change is a pressing global challenge. India is one of the countries most affected by climate change. It is also a country that has been active in the international climate regime and has an increasingly important role in international negotiations. This paper analyses the development of Indian climate policy, focusing on the role of diplomatic and economic instruments and the influence of domestic and international actors. The paper argues that India has gradually moved from a position of scepticism to a more active and cooperative role. However, the country's position is still strongly influenced by its domestic development and climate policies. In the future, India will be an important actor in climate negotiatios, but its role will depend on how the domestic policies and diplomats are able to balance the interests of its different actors and how it can successfully combine economic development with climate mitigation.",13,181,0.4581005586592179,6.128967760565874,0.8495067481393985,0.06680118489360289,0.84,0.8518709677419353,0.7431940986906214,44.75,45.324022346368714,44.667826988594285

This paper examines the role of policy story lines in climate change politics. It takes a narrative approach to analyze the politics of climate policy in India. In particular, the paper aims to understand how the narratives of the climate crisis and the need for a low-carbon economy are used to advance different policy agendas. The paper develops the notion of a policy narration, which is a storyline about a specific policy issue that is told to a particular audience in order to persuade them to support a certain policy. These narrations are then used by policy actors to legitimize their policy claims. By examining the use of these narrational tools, this paper illustrates how policy stories can be used strategically to create new policy spaces.

The present work deals with the theoretical analysis on the energy savings of the air-conditioning systems using a heat-pipe heat exchange. The energy analysis is carried out for the different climates in India. In the present study, a theoretical model is developed to calculate the efficiency of a typical air handling unit (AHU) with heat pipes in an air distribution system. A theoretical study is done to analyze the performance of heat pump heat recovery system (HPHRS) in Indian climate. An HPHRS is a system that recovers heat from the exhaust air of an AHUs and uses it to preheat the fresh air supplied to the AU. To analyze HPHPR system, the temperature profile of exhaust and fresh streams is calculated using the heat balance method.

The building energy efficiency is one of the major concerns for the sustainable development. The energy consumption in buildings is rising due to the increasing energy demand for heating and cooling. Therefore, the retrofitting of building is considered as one the most effective methods for energy saving. This paper presents the dynamic optimization approach for retrofit of existing building to enhance the energy
efficiency. A case of a 3-story building with an area of 200 m2 is studied. An optimization model is developed to identify the best retro-fit combination for a building which can reduce the total energy use. Different retro fit options are considered in the optimization process to find the optimal combination.
Based on the results, it is found that the building can be retro fitted to save 12.9% of total annual energy cost. It is also found the that optimal retro fitting",21,184,0.48633879781420764,6.579069311495698,0.8616274692051717,0.06116045178740871,0.8742857142857143,0.8598742138364781,0.7426550095913109,51.57782240316901,51.595628415300546,47.85139692927259

The climate of the Indian subcontinent is generally tropical with a monsoon type of rainfall pattern. The climate is dominated by the large landmass of Asia and the surrounding oceanic bodies. India is located in the Northern Hemisphere and its climate can be classified as having a tropical mono-modal climate.
India has three seasons- the summer, the monetary and winter. Summer starts from the month of March and lasts till the end of June. Monsoons start in June and continue till September. Winter season starts in November and ends in February. Indian climate varies from region to region. In general, Indian winters are cool and dry, summers are hot and humid and monseys are wet. However, it is important to note that the climate in India varises from one region of a country to another.

The agriculture sector is the backbone of the Indian economy. The sector contributes about 17% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 45% of total employment in the country. India is a food-deficit country and is dependent on imports for meeting its food requirements. However, in recent years, India has been able to meet its own food requirement. This achievement has come about due to a number of factors including the Green Revolution, the introduction of new crops, and improved farming practices.
However, with climate change, it is expected that the agriculturally productive areas of India will be shifted towards the north and east. Thus, there will likely be a decrease in agriculturable land in western and southern India. As a result, agriculturer productivty is likely to decline in these regions.

Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture in India
Climate change is a global phenomenon and India is not an exception. The impact of this change can be seen in the form of erratic rainfall, rise in sea level, change in seasonal pattern, increase in temperature, etc. These changes have a negative impact on agricultural production in terms of reduced crop yield, higher cash and food grain price, increased incidence of pests and diseases, and so on.
This has led to an increase of 22% in food inflation in 1998-9 and 38% increase during 97-8. In 70% of the districts in North India, wheat and rice production has decreased due to climate changes. This has resulted in an increased dependence on imported food. It has also led farmers to switch to non-food crops.

South Indian ocean climate is strongly influenced by the seasonal cycle of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), and the ENSO cycle. These two modes of variabilty are linked, with EOF analysis of SAM indices suggesting a relationship between SST anomalies in the Southwest Pacific and Indian Oceans. The SASMOD model is used to explore the relationship and to investigate the mechanics of this linkage. A simple model of tropical SOMC is constructed, which captures the dominant features of observed SOSC. This model uses a combination of linear and non-linear mechanisims to explain the observed relationship. It is shown that the model can reproduce the SAT anomaly pattern, and that ERA40 data are consistent with the linear model.

In a recent report, the World Bank warns that climate-related disasters could cost India’s economy $110 billion annually by 2050, if current trends continue. The report estimates that the agricultural sector would be the most severely affected, with losses of up to 17% of GDP by the middle of the century.
The report says that India could avoid such losses by taking steps to make its agriculturesystem more resilient to climate shocks. It recommends that, in addition to reducing emissions, India should invest in agriculturereforms and climate adaptation measures. For example, it suggests that agricultureresearch should focus more on drought-resistant varieties of crops.

The Green revolution in the 1960s and 70’s was a major technological development in Indian agriculture. It introduced a new set of high yielding varieties of wheat and rice, improved farm management practices and a set new farm machinery. The Green-revolution was accompanied by a rapid expansion in irrigation, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and use more intensive farm practices. This technologically induced transformation of Indian farming led to a significant increase in agricultural output, a sharp fall in food prices and improved rural livelihoods. However, the high yields and rapid growth in crop production were achieved at the cost of increasing the demand for water and other resources, increased use and release of toxic chemicals, degradation of",47,190,0.5660377358490566,7.137464271463297,0.8877282921147539,0.051000206480193,0.8666666666666667,0.8740740740740742,0.7893764667542064,49.904205607476634,59.9685534591195,58.21347402597402

Earth’s climate system is driven by natural cycles that can have a significant impact on the weather. One of the most important is the Indian ocean dipolar mode (IODM), which is an oscillation of sea surface temperature (SST) between the eastern and western equatorial Indian oceans.
Scientists have long recognised that IODM events are associated with changes in global rainfall patterns, but it has been unclear how these events influence the climate on a global scale. Now, researchers have used a combination of climate models and satellite observations to investigate the impact of IOMD events. They found that the events can lead to increased rains in the tropics and changes to the atmospheric circulation, which can in turn lead changes elsewhere in climate. The findings were published in Nature Climate Change.",54,198,0.5786163522012578,7.296074588606926,0.8920643193588964,0.049030535857732704,0.8999999999999999,0.8859259259259261,0.804295271057036,62.40724145407242,68.9622641509434,68.0404135338346

The world has been experiencing a significant warming trend since the mid-19th century. There is now overwhelming scientific evidence that the warmer the climate, the higher is the crop yield. However, a warmed climate also brings with it increased risks of extreme weather events like droughts and floods. The Indian economy is heavily dependent on agricultural production, which is highly vulnerable to weather extremes. This paper examines the impact of global climate changes on Indian cereal production. It finds that, in the absence of any policy changes, global warmers will lead to an increase in Indian rice and wheat production by 10-20 per cent by the year 2115.

Climate change adaptation is a challenge for developing countries like India. A study of farmer's knowledge and adaptation behaviour was undertaken in four villages in Rajasthan, India to understand the role of knowledge in adaptation. The study found that the farming communities in the villages were generally knowledgeable about climate and climate variability. They had good knowledge of weather and rainfall and also knew about the effects of climate on their crops and livestock.

Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, and it is highly dependent on climate. The Indian Agriculture sector is characterized by a wide diversity in terms of crops, soil types, agro-climatic conditions, farm sizes and farming systems. In addition, the sector exhibits high regional diversities.
The agricultural sector of India is not only the largest source of livelihood but also a major contributor to the country’s GDP. Agricultural production in India has been a matter of concern for a long time. Despite the efforts of various governments, agriculturists and scientists, there has not been much improvement in the agricultual productivity. This is mainly due to poor utilization of resources and lack of proper technology. Therefore, it becomes imperative to improve the productive capacity of Indian farmers.",69,193,0.5949367088607594,7.478238471251862,0.8974240982402913,0.04665388812486292,0.8933333333333332,0.8773134328358213,0.781816067084199,56.475079226184846,58.68354430379747,58.771321321321324

The Indian and Pacific oceans are connected by the Indian-Pacific Ocean Conveyor (IPOC). This large-scale ocean circulation system is a major contributor to the global climate system, and is strongly influenced by variations in the strength of the trade winds over the tropical Indian, Pacific and Atlantic ocean regions. The IPOC has recently been shown to be a significant contributing factor to climate variability in both the Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean.
In a paper published in Nature, scientists from the University of East Anglia, the UK Met Office and NERC's British Antarctic Survey, have shown that the IPO warms in response to changes in Pacific sea surface temperature (SST). They also show that this warmed Indian ocean, in turn, has a strong influence on the climate of South Africa, which is located near the",73,199,0.5344827586206896,7.050311805283801,0.878571604736113,0.054195816207549534,0.8666666666666667,0.874133333333333,0.7772932421609001,62.68280909374027,63.46551724137931,57.096688034188034

Tropical climate in general and the monsoon in particular have been undergoing major changes in recent decades. These changes are characterized by an increase in rainfall extremes, and a decrease in mean rains. In the present study, the observed changes have also been investigated for the tropical Indian ocean region. The observed change in tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) is known to be a major driver of the recent changes. It is shown that the changes observed in Indian region are primarily due to the influence of changes over the eastern Indian and western Pacific Ocean. A comparison of observed and simulated changes is also presented.

In this blog, we explore the sensitivity of Indian Agriculture in the face of climate variability and change. We find that Indian farmers are more sensitive to rainfall and temperature than other farming communities in Africa.
Climate change has a direct impact on the agricultural sector, which is the backbone of the Indian economy. The impact of global warming on Indian climate is evident in changes in rainy seasons, floods, droughts, and extreme heat. These changes have a cascading impact in terms of crop yield, livestock production, human health, food security, etc. In addition, the impacts of extreme weather events are exacerbated by the growing population, urbanisation, industrialisation and land degradation. Thus, India is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climatic variabilities and changes.

Abstract. The monetary value of rainfall in India is high, and the impact of its variabilities on the economy is even higher. This is due to the fact that the country is highly dependent on rain-fed agriculture. In this paper, the mono-seasonal rains of the Indian summer mon-soons (ISM) are studied in relation with the global vari-abilities of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and oceanic heat content (OHC). The analysis is based on observations of ISM ra-infalls and SST anomalies. ISMR is found to be highly correlated with SAT anomaly over the whole country.

A study published in Climate Dynamics shows that future climate warming will lead to an increase in the intensity of Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) in general, but the magnitude of change will vary across the country.
In this study, the authors used a high-resolution climate model to simulate the ISM under historical (1950-2005) and future (2101- 2299) conditions. The model was driven by the output of a global climate simulation under historic and RCP8.5 (a scenario of future warmer and wetter climate) forcing. Under future conditions, ISR will be warmed by about 0.6-06.4°C. However, it will become more variable in terms of the seasonal mean and the interannual variabilities.

Climate change is a global concern and a major issue for the farming community. Farmers are vulnerable to climate variability and climate-related disasters. The perceptual differences between farmers and non-farmers regarding climate risk are less understood. In this study, we aim to understand the perpective of farms towards climate risks and their adaptation strategies.
We used a survey of 182 farmland holders and 204 nonfamers in the western HImalayan region of India. We used the AHP approach to analyse the data. Descriptive statistics and the Kruskal-Wallis test were used to assess the differences in percpetion of risk between the two groups.

Abstract. The Indian summer mon-soons are known to be highly sensitive to the ocean-atmosphere interaction. In this study, the role of Indian ocean in the variabilities of regional precipitation and temperature is investigated. A composite analysis of daily temperature and rainy days over India is performed over 1984–2014 using the observed data from the India Meteorological Department. It is found that the mono-modal distribution of rains is highly influenced by the SST anomalies over the central Indian and the southwest Indian oceans. However, a strong association between the raining days and SLP anomaly is not observed.

The agreement also sets a long-term goal to achieve a balance between sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs) by the second half of this century. India has ratified the Paris agreement and is committed to achieving the goals set under the agreement.

The Western Ghat mountain range is an important climatic feature in peninuslar India. It is a barrier to the southwest monsoon and is responsible for the present day rainy season pattern in the western part of India, which is characterized by a distinct raining season (June to September) and a dry season. The Western ghat also has a profound effect on rains in southern India and the eastern coast of Africa.
It has been known for some time that the rainiest part in south India is the region around the city of Mangalore. This is where the rain shadow of Western India begins and it is also the place where most of south Indian raindrops are produced. In this study, the climatological effect of this mountain barier is investigated using a numerical weather prediction model.

The analysis is based upon the CMIP3 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3) database, which contains 16 models and 21 ensembles of simulations for the period 00-099. A number of indices of temperature and precipitation are computed for different seasons, regions and timescales. It is found that the spatial pattern of changes in precipitations is more complex than that of temperatures, with some regions experiencing increases in rainfall and others decreases. However, the magnitude of change is not uniform across the country.

Abstract. In this study, we examine the atmospherically‐induced variability in sea surface temperature (SST) and the associated hydrological cycle over the equatorward region of the Indian monsoon westerlies. We use the Coupled Ocean‐Atmosphere Data Assimilation System (COADS) to examine these processes and their influence on SST. The COAD‐based analysis reveals a large-scale atmosperic response to SAT anomaly in this region, which is characterized by a southward shift of a strong wavelike Rossby wave response in SLP and a weakening of convection in a region extending from the eastern equitorial Indian ocean to the Maritime Continent",96,184,0.674074074074074,7.832032988997221,0.9195936436312871,0.03774354871420766,0.9040000000000001,0.9005405405405404,0.8343349377034085,83.23862968621461,95.52592592592593,94.57664437012264

The mono-seasonal nature of the Asian summer mon- soon rainfall has been a major impediment to the successful prediction of this phenomenon. The present study investigates the ability of global and regional models to represent this monosonal climate feature. Global models are found to be able to capture the monoso- nal feature of Indian summer rains in terms of spatial pattern, seasonal cycle and interannual variability. However, the regional model simulates rainy days, but is unable to simulate the spatial patterns of ra- infall. This may be due to its inability to resolve the moisture transport processes.

The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has identified six major climatic zones in the country, viz. tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, semi-arid and arid. The Indian climate is characterized by three major seasons, i.e. summer, winter and monsoon.
Climate is the long term pattern of weather. Climate is influenced by various factors like latitude, altitude, distance from the sea, land and water distribution, prevailing winds, topography, and so on. India is situated between 8°N to 37° N latitudes and 68o E to97oE longitudes. It has a vast geographical area and varied climates. Due to the variation in latitude and altitudes, India has varied climate.

The global climate change regime is notoriously unequal in terms of the responsibilities it assigns to different countries. As a result, the climate regime has been criticized for being too weak to solve the problem it seeks to address. This paper argues that the Indian state's emergent climate policy reflects the inequalities of this regime, but that it also creates the conditions for a more equal regime in the future. India' s climate policies have been shaped by the country'''s weak capacity, its limited bargaining power, and the lack of international support for its interests. In response, India has pursued a strategy of 'opportunistic compliance' with the regime. The paper shows that this strategy has had mixed results. While it has contributed to the internationalization of Indian climate politics, it simultaneously has undermined the domestic legit",103,200,0.5280898876404494,7.045597876561097,0.876782045829357,0.05475331451205701,0.8628571428571429,0.8714285714285716,0.7626368487874093,59.333333333333336,56.151685393258425,59.19409430438843

The objective of this paper is to study the performance of photothermal (PT) collector, photocollector and photoplume collectors for energy production and energy storage in the form of sensible and latent heat. The monthly performance analysis is carried out using MATLAB and Simulink for a typical Indian location. A detailed energy analysis for each collecting element is performed and the results are compared with the month-wise energy output of the PV system. It is observed that PT collecter performs better than the photolume and PVC collecters. In case of PTC, the energy collected by the collective elements is stored in a thermal storage tank. Hence, it is used to produce the required energy in winter season. This helps in increasing the overall energy yield of a PTS system by 1",105,195,0.5371428571428571,7.105732092573472,0.8796675806526433,0.053647070060997476,0.8857142857142856,0.8603973509933774,0.7800365286577927,58.333333333333336,59.777142857142856,54.72257525083612

Indian climate,Assessing the impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: Evidence from major crop yields,"Assessing the impact of climate change on Indian agriculture: Evidence from major crop yields
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the implications of changing climate on agricultural production in India. Design/methodology/approach – This paper assesses the effects of temperature and precipitation on the major crops of India: rice, wheat, maize, soybean, sugarcane, cotton, and pearl millet. The study is based on a panel data of 29 years (1980-2008). Findings – Increase in temperature leads to a decline in rice production, whereas increase in precipitations leads a rise in the production of wheats and maizes. In case of soya bean, there is a positive impact on production. However, the effect of change in climate is not significant for sugar cane and cotten. Research limitations/implications – It is observed that climate has a significant effect on rice",107,189,0.49101796407185627,6.345350506779922,0.8610247313259973,0.06252496459984845,0.8666666666666667,0.8545454545454543,0.7605513855429835,47.02539249835933,47.32335329341317,43.171632216678546

The Hindu Kush Hindukush (HKH) is a unique mountain range, stretching from Afghanistan to Nepal and from Pakistan to China, covering a total area of 3500 km2 and with a population of around 20 million. The HK region is known to be vulnerable to climate change and variability. Apart from the fact that it is an important source of water for 1.3 billion people living in India, Pakistan, Afghan-istan, China and Central Asia, the HH region has the potential to play a significant role in mitigating the impact of climate vari-ability and change. In fact, it has been suggested that the role of HI region in climate miti-gation is crucial and that any climate policy for the region should include a HIMALAYA-wide approach.

The impacts of climate change on agricultural production are likely to be severe in India. This paper assesses the sensitivities of the Indian crop sector to temperature and rainfall changes, using a state-of-the-art cereal production model. We find that the impact of temperature change is more severe than that of rains. In the absence of adaptation, the net negative impact is about 15% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2050. With adaptation to climate variability, this impact reduces to 8% by the same year.

The Indian summer Monsoons (ISM) is the dominant mode of seasonal climate variability in the Indian subcontinent. The ISM is characterized by a southwest mon-soonal flow of moisture-laden air from the tropical Indian ocean, and is accompanied by heavy rainfall in India and Pakistan during June to September. This mono-sonal system is also known as the South Asian Mono sonal Pulse (SAM).
Several studies have shown that the SAM is closely linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, the mechanism of this link is still unclear. In addition, there is evidence that ENSO may have played a role in climate changes in South Asia during pre-historic times.

Climate change is likely to have an impact in all sectors of human activity, including health. It is already affecting food security, water supply, energy, human migration, infectious disease transmission, natural disasters, coastal erosion and forestry. These changes are likely not only to reduce the quality of life, but also to affect the ability of health systems to respond to health challenges.

The Indian economy has experienced rapid growth in the last two decades, and this has been accompanied by a shift towards more energy intensive food consumption. In this study, we assess the implications of the projected increase in food demand for greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from the agriculture sector. We use the FAO food balance sheets, the IPCC 2007 Tier 1 and Tier2 methodologies and the LCA-IPCC method to estimate the GHGEs (g CO2e/MJ) from crop and livestock production. Our results show that the Indian agricultura sector is responsible for 4.3% of global GGGE in 3.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) per year.

Here, we investigate the association between the Indian summer mon-soonal rainevents and south-western winter (May–September) storms, using a 10-yr record of daily raingauge data from the south coast of Western Australia. The results show that the frequency of southwesterly storm events is strongly influenced by the strength of the southern annular mode (SAM), a pattern of climate variation in the Southern Hemisphere.

Today, more than half of the world’s population lives in cities. Cities are a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accounting for 60–80% of total global emissons. Closing this gap is essential to achieving the Paris Agreement.
In the context of climate change, cities are the main actors in the transition to a low-carbon society. They are responsible for the design, implementation and monitoring of local climate policies and initiatives. In addition, they are also the drivers of global climate action. The role of cities in climate policy is therefore critical. However, research on this topic is still limited. It is necessary to increase the knowledge on the role and potential of urban areas in achving climate objectives. This is why, in 2018, the EU-funded project CITY-GOLD was launched.

Indian climate,The influence of the Indian Ocean dipole on atmospheric circulation and climate,"The influence of the Indian Ocean dipole on atmospheric circulation and climate over the Horn of Africa
The Indian-Ocean dipoles (IOD) are large-scale coupled ocean-atmosphere oscillations that occur over tropical Indian ocean. They are known to have a significant impact on the climate of East Africa and the region is prone to frequent droughts and floods associated with the IOD events. This study investigates the impact of IODI on climate and atmos-pherics circulations over Horn-of-Africa (HOA) and East- Africa. The analysis is based on monthly averaged sea-level pressure (SLP) fields and month-to-month changes in SLP anomalies for the period 1980-2010. IODi events are identified using the SST anomaly of 0°C as a threshold value. Results show that IODis have significant influence on SPL anom-alyses over HOA.

Agriculture is the backbone of Indian economy. It contributes to 17% of the GDP and provides livelihood to over 58% population. The sector is also responsible for 24% greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is a major source of water consumption.
The sector has been experiencing various challenges like climate variability, unpredictable rainfall patterns, extreme weather events, water scarcity, soil degradation and decline in soil fertility. These challenging conditions are likely to worsen due to climate changes. In order to cope with these challenged, the sector needs to adopt various adaptation measures. As per the assessment by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the agricultural productivity is likely be reduced by 4.2% by the end of 8th decade",131,182,0.6333333333333333,7.756717518813398,0.908842217466139,0.041890606450677555,0.8999999999999999,0.8806349206349205,0.8204271206531599,77.43142144638404,77.03333333333333,72.03911058169545

Severe flooding in the Indian Subcontinents has been increasing in recent years. The number of floods in India has increased by 20% since 1950 and flooded area increased 400%. The impacts of climate change are expected to increase the floody risk.
The study, published in PNAS, shows that the number and severity of the flash flooda in Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are increasing. This is due to the increase in precipitation intensity and the increased frequency of extreme rainfall events. In India, the average rainstorm duration has doubled over the last 60 years and extreme rain events have increased from 5 to 8 per year. A 3°C warmer climate is expected by the end of this century.

The report, Urban Green Space Planning for Climate Adaptation in India Cities, is a joint publication by ICLEI South Asia and the World Resources Institute India. It provides a comprehensive overview of the state of urban green spaces in cities across India, and makes recommendations for green infrastructure planning to support climate change adaptation.
Cities are particularly vulnerable to climate risks, as they are home to a majority of India’s population. The report finds that cities are highly vulnerably to flooding and extreme heat, with extreme weather events affecting cities such as Chennai, Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata and Ahmedabad. A lack of planning has led to cities having a very low green cover, which exacerbates the impacts of climate-related events.

Abstract. Urban areas are exposed to flood hazards due to land uses and land cover changes. Increasing urbanization and global warming will further increase the floods in cities. However, there is a lack of studies on the combined effects of urban expansion and urban climate. This study aims to assess the impacts of these two factors on flooded areas in Indian urban centres. For this purpose, a spatially explicit model, which combines land-use and rainfall-runoff models, was used. The model was applied to 152 urban catchments in India. Flooded area was defined as the area covered by floody waters during rainy season. Land use data was obtained from Corine land Cover 2006 data. Rainfall data were obtained for the period 01-10-",135,197,0.5344827586206896,7.050311805283801,0.878571604736113,0.054195816207549534,0.8799999999999999,0.8594666666666666,0.7908126295808193,58.0,56.85057471264368,50.8125

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) highlights the need for local-level planning to incorporate climate considerations, including adaptation and mitigation. However, the extent to which climate concerns are addressed in spatial planning is not well understood. This paper presents an evaluation tool to assess the level of climate integration in the spatial development plans of Indian urban areas. The evaluation includes both a qualitative assessment of the plans, based on a set of indicators, as well as a quantitative analysis of plan-related information. It is found that the majority of plans do not include climate-sensitive indications. While the indication of miti- gation actions is generally weak, adaptation is more prevalent. In addition, it is demonstrated that adaptation indic- ations are more likely to be included in plans when there is a greater degree of stakeholder involvement",136,197,0.5489130434782609,7.445818785822305,0.8849812790325269,0.0507849769632393,0.8514285714285713,0.8530000000000009,0.7977607318738136,58.338541666666664,61.21195652173913,49.88452380952381

Climate change is a global challenge that is affecting all nations. In India, climate-related issues have been on the policy agenda since the early 1990s. This paper examines the political context of the development of Indian climate policy, and the emergence of narrative of cobbenefit as a key element of its discourse. It also looks at how the narration of this cobbeneft has been used to justify the adoption of a mitigation-centric approach to climate action. The paper concludes that the politics around climate in the country is marked by a dominant narrativ of technological fix, which has led to a narrow and technocratic approach.

Sarath Guttal
Climate change is expected to affect the Indian economy through its impact on agricultural production and hence on the food security of the country. This paper uses a spatial econometric approach to estimate the impact of climate on Indian crop production. The econometrics is based on a panel of 29 states and 19 crops over the period 30 years (1899-12). The results suggest that the spatial variation in the effect of temperature on cereal yields is large, and that cobweb-shaped spatial patterns emerge. While the average impact is negative, the magnitude of this impact varies across states. In addition, there are significant regional differences in sensitivities to rainfall.

Ecologists and other scientists have long recognized the importance of time in ecosystem dynamics. Yet, little is known about how people incorporate time into their knowledge of ecologically relevant phenomena. This paper explores the role of seasonal and annual time cycles in traditional eco- logical knowledge (TEK) of the indigenous Jarawa people of India's Andamans Islands. It is argued that the Jarawas' TEK of environmental change is strongly time-dependent, with season and year having a high degree of predictive power. The TE K is also strongly culture-specific, in that it is based on an intimate knowledge and understanding of local ecology and seasonally relevant environmental phenom- ena. In addition, TEIK is often linked",140,182,0.6163522012578616,7.771905540037812,0.904528335071377,0.043368669775152066,0.9199999999999999,0.9285925925925919,0.8106078612932232,82.20632317121081,84.54088050314465,85.52549019607844

The tropical Pacific Ocean has experienced significant warmer-than-average surface temperatures in recent decades, but the Indian and Atlantic Oceans have also warmed. In this study, the role of the atmos-pheres in warping the global ocean temperature field is investigated. The Indian ocean is simulated in three general circulation models (GCMs) with a variety of ocean and atmosphere configurations. All models show an increase in tropical ocean heat content, and the magnitude of this war-ming is related to the strength of zonal winds over the ocean. Two of these models, with atmosph-eres that are dynamically coupled with the ocea-n, show a significant increase of sea surface temperature (SST) in both the Pacific and Indian O-cean.

In the case of India, the AR4 has predicted a reduction in annual precipitation in India by between 0.5 and 6.0% by the end of the ­century.
This reduction is expected to be most pronounced in semi-arid and arid regions of northwest, north, central and northeastern India. This would result in a significant reduction of water available for agricultural use. It is estimated that about a quarter of irrigated agricultur­al lands in north India are likely be affected by this",149,198,0.5636363636363636,7.240040180702163,0.887710124661921,0.05063841640480763,0.8933333333333332,0.8899290780141849,0.7975634269926043,58.47361307516106,66.7090909090909,56.98273373878982

Jaspreet Kaur,
The study aims to understand the mainstreamed climate adaptation actions in Kolka-ta, a city in India. It also seeks to identify the challenges faced by the city government and the way forward for main-stream climate action. The study finds that the Kol-kat-a Municipal Corporation (KMC) has taken several adaptation measures in the form of infrastructure development, institutional strengthening, policy development and capacity building. However, the study identifies that these measures are not well planned and are disconnected from the climate vulnerability of the community. This is due to the absence of a climate resilient city action plan. Further, there is a lack of coordination among the different agencies working on climate related issues. Therefore, for effective main stream-ing of climate actions, it is crucial to have a proper",151,189,0.543859649122807,7.111887749987415,0.8815433844209584,0.05304828567669944,0.86,0.8631292517006809,0.7734016268037345,57.41803278688525,55.72514619883041,55.67355371900827

This chapter examines the ways in which climate has been represented in India’s mainstream print media, with a specific focus on the Indian Express. The paper argues that climate coverage in the main Indian English-language print press is largely limited to the weather and weather-related disasters. It arguably reflects the broader societal lack of engagement with climate issues. However, this study finds that there has also been a rise in coverage of the issue of ‘climate change’ in Indian newspapers.

An analysis of orbital forcing mechanisms on the monsoonal climate of India has been performed using a coupled ocean–atmosphere model (COAMPS). The model has a 1.44° resolution in both the ocean and the atmosphere, and is forced by both orbiter and radiative forcing. The orbitor forcing is a combination of both precession and obliquity, while the radiati ve forcing consists of a CO2 forcing and an orbite r forcing that is similar to the orbitu r oblique forcing, but with a lower magnitude. Our model shows that the predominant effect of obliquit y is to increase the intensity of summer mon- soons, which is in agreement with previous model studies. We show that obl iquity also increases the frequency of extreme mon soon events, defined as those events that are more intense",163,182,0.5740740740740741,7.306770072260991,0.8909117772894658,0.049372021458344996,0.8666666666666667,0.8675362318840569,0.7906989995457907,46.32350186569938,56.22839506172839,44.68562976935608

A model of the Indian ocean is developed from the global couple model GEOS-3. The model is forced by the sea surface temperature (SST) from a global ocean couple climate simulation. An ocean eddy-resolving model, the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), is used to study the ocean circulation. A new parameterization of oceanic heat flux is introduced to represent the effect of eddies on the heat exchange between the surface and the subsurface ocean. This parameterized formulation is applied in a couple ocean-atmosphere model to simulate the variabilities of SST and rainfall in India. Simulations are conducted for the period 1958-1899. It is found that the couple system is able to reproduce the observed variabilites of Indian rainy season, and that it is the interplay between ocean and atmosphere that is responsible for these variabilties.

The paper uses the UCLs concept to identify the areas in which the heat is concentrated in a city. This is done by analyzing the urban surface temperature in 100 m resolution for the year 2016. A land use land cover map is used to classify the land surface into different categories. To identify UHIs, the temperature of land surfaces in different land-use categories is compared with the average temperature for a particular zone. These zones are classified into three categories: (a) UHI hotspots, (b) moderate UHLs, and (c) no ULHI zones.

The Indian mono-soonal rainfall regime is characterized by a strong seasonal cycle and a significant interannual variability. In this study, the authors use the Community Climate System Model (CCSM) to simulate the mon-o soonal climate of India using three different nested domain sizes: 20, 10 and 5°. The authors focus on the large-scale circulation and the associated monosonal precipitation and find that the 40-yr mean precipita-tion is most sensitive to the domain-size selection. This is due to a combination of both the circula-tional changes and precipitaton response to these changes.

Climate change is a reality and there is no doubt about its impact on global warming. This has led to a change in the global energy scenario with a growing demand for alternative energy sources. India has been a major producer and consumer of biofuel. However, with the increase in demand, it has also been facing the problem of the availability of feedstock for bioethanol production. The use of agricultural residues, which are otherwise considered as waste, for the production of ethanols is not economically viable due to the high cost of production and the low price of petroleum-based fuels. In this context, the Government of India, in 2009, announced the National Policy on Biofuelfor the promotion of second generation bio-ethylol.

Indian climate,"Learning, adaptation, and climate uncertainty: Evidence from Indian agriculture","Learning, adaptation, and climate uncertainty: Evidence from Indian agriculture
In recent years, the Indian government has launched a number of programs to increase the resilience of agricultural producers to climate shocks. This paper assesses the impact of these programs on farmers' adaptation strategies and their well-being. The analysis relies on a large-scale survey of farming households in India conducted in 2010 and 11. It finds that climate risk has increased in recent decades, especially in the rainfed areas of India. We find that farmer adaptations to this risk have been successful in reducing the adverse impacts of climate variability. However, we also find evidence of increasing climate-related uncertainty. Farmers' uncertainty has been increasing in part because of the changing nature of rains, which has led to increasing uncertainty about the timing and amount of monsoon rainstorms, as well as the amount and distribution of pre-monsoonal and",170,193,0.5087719298245614,6.653056282246291,0.8685726068183811,0.05885697362837675,0.86,0.8731972789115651,0.7655700308573654,47.58953595838885,52.760233918128655,53.714105339105345

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed interannual to decadal variabilities of the tropical climate. These mechanistic links are not independent but interact with each other and the ocean-atmosphere coupled system. In this study, we focus on the interactions between the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) in the Indian subcontinent and between ENSO and North Atlantic oscillation in North America. We use the global couple model ECHAM5-MPIOM, forced by observed sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, to simulate the impact of ENA on IOD and of IODI on EAO. The ESAO is also simulated. It is found that the IODi anomaly",171,196,0.6129032258064516,7.630583624573739,0.9029333807938554,0.04431594506312893,0.8599999999999999,0.8882442748091606,0.8245850997676338,82.89267773616689,79.27741935483871,67.95677781805001

Indian summer rains (ISR) are the rainy season of India. These rainstorms are caused by the southwest mon- sion which brings moisture from the Indian ocean to India during the summer months. The onset of ISR is an important event in the agricultural calendar of the country. It is also an event of great importance for the meteorological community as it is one of only two major mono- sesonally active regions of raining in India, the other being the winter monson. This paper examines the ISRA rai- nfall in terms of its relation with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Southern Indian Oc- ean climate (SIOC) indices. ISRS have been found to be positively correlated with both ESO and SIOC.

The Indian state of Uttarakhand is home to many ecosystems and species, including the Hindu pilgrimage site of Badrinath, which is located in a high-altitude alpine zone. The region is also subject to extreme weather events, such as the 2013 floods and the recent heat wave. These events are likely to become more frequent and severe as a result of climate-induced changes in hydrology and temperature.
In this study, the authors develop a so-called vulnerable system approach (VSA) to assess the impacts of hydro-climatic changes on soils, vegetation, and human communities in this region. They use a combination of remote sensing and field data to estimate the sensitivity of the system to changes and to identify the drivers of vulnerabilities. Their results show that the VSA is",174,184,0.5798816568047337,7.538461538461538,0.8937734901729589,0.04768039129057116,0.8933333333333334,0.8948965517241378,0.779579126908944,69.37996688741721,62.739644970414204,65.5826164874552

Farming is a predominantly male-dominated activity in India. In this study, we explored the diversities of the adaptation responses of women and men farming households to the impacts of climate variability and change in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. We conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with 10 women farmer-households and 9 men. Our results revealed that women are more vulnerable than men to climatic risks and their responses are gender-specific. Women farmed on a smaller scale, were more dependent on rainfall, and were less aware of weather forecasts and climate information. They also had less access to technology and finance. Their coping strategic choices were mainly in terms of crop diversification and cash crops, which were found to",175,193,0.588957055214724,7.51930031988439,0.8960683212822101,0.04698140361644089,0.8666666666666667,0.8676258992805759,0.8099460557201144,65.09691315401274,66.0,62.77246763137852

Assessment of reliabilities of climate model outputs is crucial for climate change impact assessment. This paper presents an approach to assess the reliablity of the regional progession of mono-seasonal climate variables. The approach is based on the concept of uncertainty in climate models. It uses a Bayesian approach based upon a Monte Carlo simulation. For the Indian summer mon-soonal climate, the results show that the seasonal mean rainfall is more reliable than the other variables considered.

This study examines the relationship between the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and surface ocean circulations in the Tropical Atlantic Ocean, the Eastern Tropics, Indian Ocean and Southern Ocean. It is found that the SAM is strongly associated with the surface wind stress in all regions, with a particularly strong relationship in winter. This is associated in turn with changes in sea level pressure and the winds in these regions. The relationship is not linear, however, but is more complex and is characterized by two dominant modes of variability. These are associated respectively with positive and negative SST anomalies in each region. In the Atlantic and Eastern Indian, these modes are also associated, respectively, positive or negative,",183,190,0.5271739130434783,7.150934873512511,0.8772324705685077,0.0542063596392739,0.8514285714285714,0.8392500000000002,0.7553981295996091,49.02027679433537,51.516304347826086,47.832330513523175

Abstract. The timing of Indian summer mon-soonal rainfall is controlled by the strength of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is linked to global climate. In this study, we reconstruct the timing and intensity of ENSO over the last 45 ka using a new multiproxy dataset from Lake Erhai, a high-elevation lake in the Himalayan–Tibet region. Our results show that Indian Summer Monsoons (ISMs) were more intense and frequent during the early Holocene, in particular from 14.6 to 9.7 ka, when the Indian ISM was more similar to present day.

The Rossy wave has been identified as the key source of interannual variabilities in the Indian monsoon rainfall. The wave is found to have a significant influence on the inter-annually fluctuations of the sea surface temperature (SST) in both the tropical Indian and western Pacific Ocean.

The present study aims to examine the relationship between deforestations, environmental degradation and climate changes with the food and nutrient security in India. The study analyses the trends of deforsest and depletion of forest cover in the country over the past three decades and examines the impact of climate variability and changes on food security and malnutritions in rural India during the same period.
It is found that deforesstion and environmental changes have adversely affected the nutritive values of food crops in different parts of the India, thereby leading to malnourishment of rural population. It is also found, however, that the Indian government has taken a number of measures to increase the production of nutriments and reduce the mal-nutrients in foods. These measures have been successful to some extent.

Challenging times for Indian Agriculture: Increasingly uncertain and changing climatic conditions, coupled with growing population, will pose new challenges for the Indian farmers and the agriculturists.
Indian agricultures are facing increasing challenging scenarios, as the climate is becoming increasingly unpredictable and unstable. The uncertainties in the weather patterns are becoming more frequent and more severe. In addition, the growing demands of the ever increasing population and food security are making the situation even more challenged. Climate change is already affecting the country, and its impacts are expected to intensify in future.

Indian climate,The Indian Ocean dipole–the unsung driver of climatic variability in East Africa,"The Indian Ocean dipole–the unsung driver of climatic variability in East Africa
The Indian ocean dipoles (IODs) are among the most prominent modes of climate variabilities in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. However, their influence on climate in Eastern Africa has remained elusive. Here, we show that the IOD is the primary driver for the observed climate anomalies in Kenya and Tanzania. We used the 100-year reanalysis dataset to show how the Indian monsoon and East African rainfall are controlled by the strength of the dipolediabatic heating. The diabatically heated air is transported towards the equator and causes the atmospheric divergence, which drives the monopole diurnal circulation. This diversion of air masses in turn modulates the rains over East and Southern Africa. Our results indicate that while the East Indian Oscillation (EIO) is a strong driver",197,191,0.6258064516129033,7.791227490354239,0.9070643208633232,0.042429956711264906,0.8733333333333334,0.8827480916030539,0.7972763311222308,82.04105463213503,72.70967741935483,74.96908602150538

The age and origin of the Indian and Ceylonese laterite deposits are discussed in the light of their palaeo-latitudes, which are estimated from the pH of samples from different parts of India and Sri Lanka. The pegmatite-bearing lateritic soils of south-eastern India, and of Sri lanka, are older than those of north-western India. This suggests that the laterities of southern India are derived from a pre-Cretaceous source area, whereas those in north India originated from an area which was much more recently uplifted.

The energy performance of buildings is influenced by the climatic conditions of the region where it is located. The climactic conditions are influenced mainly by geographical location, geomorphology, topography, vegetation, and human activities. This paper presents a life cycle assessment of an Indian resident building, located in different climatically extreme regions of India. Two different building envelope options (traditional and modern) and two different types of building construction materials (concrete and steel) are considered for the study. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate the impact of climatology on the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission of each building option. It is found that the building constructed with modern enclosure and concrete walls has the lowest energy and emission in all the climate zones.

It draws on a recent review of climate impacts in cor- als and other marine ecosystems, and synthesizes information from the cora- l ree-specific literature on resil- ience. Resilient coralls are not only those that survive disturbance events, but also those whose reproductive potential is maintained. The paper reviews the resi- lience of coralla to the effects of temperature, the most important climate factor affecting coraldiversity. Corals can tolerate temperature changes of up to 10 °C, as long as the change is gradual.

ABSTRACT: We investigate the mode shift of the meridional wind stress in a global ocean general circulation model (OGCM) with a high-resolution (0.25°) Indian ocean. The model simulates a significant change in Indian monsoon precipitation and the ocean heat content under the present day (1990) and future climate (2095) conditions. A mode-shift in winds is seen to occur in response to the change of precipitations and ocean heating. In the future, the wind-stress over the southwest Indian shelf region decreases, while the east coast of India experiences a strengthening of wind. We find that the shift is associated with the anomalous zonal wind associated to an anomalously weakened low-level jet and an intensified high level jet",201,194,0.5217391304347826,6.620127412408445,0.87196697617212,0.05801682190626633,0.86,0.8554744525547452,0.783721505364584,55.877533324265514,57.515527950310556,51.199078160243204

Climate change is one of the major concerns for the sustainable development of agricultural sector. The study aims to assess the role of weather variables and climate indices in influencing the land-productivity of Indian agricultures. A panel dataset of 23 states of India for 1990–2015 has been used for empirical analysis. Different models of land yield have been estimated by using a panel regression model. In the first stage of analysis, the effect of various weather and climatic variables on the yield of cereal crops has also been analyzed. Results of panel analysis show that the average land yields of wheat, rice, and maize have increased in the last two decades. However, there is a wide variation in yields among states.

Crop production in India is highly sensitive to the climate. In this study, we use two agri-climatic zones (ACZs) of India, viz., Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Deccan Plateau (DP), to analyze the sensitivity and response of major crops to changes in rainfall and temperature. The results show that the rainy season monsoon rains play a key role in determining the performance of cropping systems in both ACZ. However, the cropland areas are more sensitive in the DP than in IGP. Further, in Dharwar and Marathwada ACs, rabi cropped areas show a higher response to raining season rainstorms.

The summer climate of East Asia is influenced by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Pacific OScillations (NPO), and other climate modes. We show that the summer ENSO signal is well predicted by a linear combination of EOFs of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. The NPO is related to the SST anomaly in a different region of eastern Asia. This leads to a high predictability for the NPOT (the North-Pacific–Tropics–Ocean) mode.

This paper presents a study of the potential energy savings of cool-roof concept in a building in the hot and humid climate of Chennai, India. The study is carried out using a calibration model of EnergyPlus, which is validated with measured data. A cooling load simulation is performed with the model and the results are compared with those of non-cool roof case. It is found that the cooler roof reduces the air-conditioning energy consumption by 13.5%. The energy reduction is more significant in summer season.

A comparatively content analysis of news coverage of the climate crisis in the German newspaper Die Zeit, the Indian newspaper The Hindu and the US magazine Mother Jones was conducted to examine how climate change is framed in media discourses. The study shows that while the news media in all three countries use a similar discourse of risk and crisis, there are differences in how the crisis is constructed and how solutions are discussed. In India, climate coverage is mostly about the effects of global warming on the country, while in Germany, it is more about how Germany can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

The zoogeographical patterns of the West Indies have been influenced by the Pleisocence climates, as well as by more recent climatological changes. The West India fauna is composed of species from the New World and the Old World. Many of these species have a distribution which extends from one to the other of those two worlds. This distribution is usually one of contact. Species with such a pattern are usually found on islands which are of volcanic origin. These species are found in the same distributional pattern in both the western and eastern hemispheres.

The East African-Indian Ocean (EAIO) region is one of the most active monsoon areas in the world, with a strong influence on the climate and economy of East and South Africa. It is also known as a region with significant interannual climate variability, and it is important to understand the mechanics of this variabilty.

The Indian monsoon is one of the most important components of global climate. The monopole mode is the dominant mode in its variabilities. In this study, we have found that the mono-pole mode dominates the variabilty of Indian summer mon-soonal rainfall (ISMR) over the past 200 years. However, the equator-ward propagation of ISMR vari-ability is weak during the period of 0-30°N in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hem-sphere.

The tropical rainforests of India are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the world. They are also one of the largest carbon sinks on the planet. However, the forested areas of this region are under threat. The changing climate is one factor that is contributing to the loss of these forrests.
Climate change is causing an increase in temperature, which is leading to a decrease in rainfall in many parts of South Asia. This is having a negative impact on agriculture and forestry, and is also leading people to migrate to urban areas.

The relationship between lighting activity, and the projecting change of climate is studied for the first time over Indian Sub-Continent. The relationship is analysed using the lightening data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall data. A significant correlation is observed between the number of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightnings and rainy days over India. It is also found that the CG lightings are more frequent during the monsoon season and during early post mono-soonal period. In the present study, the relationship of CG and CG-IC (intra-cloud) flashes with the raining days is found to be significant. However, CG flash density and IC flash densities are not found significant over this region.

Indian climate,Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities,"Recognition in urban climate justice: Marginality and exclusion of migrants in Indian cities
Migration and urbanisation are two of the most important processes shaping contemporary India. Both processes are intricately connected to each other. However, the relationship between these processes has not been studied in a comprehensive manner. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring the ways in which migration shapes urban spaces in India, and how urban development affects migrant populations.
The paper is based on a case study of Delhi. It is argued that migration is a process that is not only intrinsically connected with urban growth, but also shapes the urban fabric in complex ways. Migrants are often marginalised and pushed to the peripheries of cities, which results in their exlusion from the mainstream urban life. The paper also argues that the process of urbanization is also uneven, with the poor and marganalised groups being the worst affected.",223,198,0.5266272189349113,6.846153846153846,0.8749951254738273,0.0561091703035452,0.9,0.8846896551724144,0.766669815411314,63.70964626245669,63.21301775147929,62.126841243862515

The Government of India (GOI) has recently made climate adaptation a priority. This has been reflected in the GOI’s National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and the subsequent State Action Plans on climate (SAPCs). In 2013, the Government released the first set of SAPs for 12 states. A new paper by the ODI and SANDRP argues that while these SapC’ are a step in right direction, they need to be strengthened to ensure that climate risk is integrated into the main development planning process.

Coral cores from the central Pacific Ocean were analyzed for the period 1886-1990. The cores were from corals at depths of 45 to 60 m, at a latitude of approximately 9°N. This location is in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Corals were selected from a single species, Acropora palmata. All cores had similar growth patterns, with a high-density growth phase between ∼14 and 30 years, followed by a low-growth phase. In the high density phase, the growth rate was 2.6 mm yr- ¹, while in low density growth phases the rate decreased to as low as 0 mm year-¹.

India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The Indian economy is growing at an average rate of 7.5% in last 10 years. This growth is mainly attributed to the private sector. As a result, the Indian private companies have become one the largest employers in India.
The Indian business environment is highly competitive and complex. It is characterized by the presence of large multinational companies, small and medium enterprises, and family businesses. These business environments are also characterised by high levels of corruption and bribery. In such a complex business landscape, it is important for managers to be able to build trust with their employees and other stakeholders.

This paper explores the link between climate variabilities and human migration. We employ a panel data set for India and employ an instrumental variable approach to address the endogeneity of climate shocks. The results show that the impact of rainfall shock on migration is positive in the short run and negative in medium and long run. Rainfall shock has a negative impact on the migration outflow in all the states. However, the effect of the rainy season on in-migration is ambiguous. On the other hand, rabi shock is found to have a positive impact in both the directions of migration, while the monsoon shock and the summer season are found not to be associated with migration flows.

Climate change is a serious threat to the sustainability of agriculture in the North-Eastern Region (NER) of India. The region is prone to floods, droughts, landslides and cyclones. Climatic events are becoming more severe and frequent in recent years. It is reported that the frequency of drastic weather events in NER has increased by 50 per cent in last two decades. This is attributed to global warming. Recent studies show that Northeast India is one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change.

In this paper, we have examined the observed variabilities and changes in the IOD and ENSO and their impacts on monosonal variablity and rains over India during 60 years of period 01-06-1948 to 31 -12-2100. We have also examines the variabilty of Indian",232,182,0.6015037593984962,6.936879756192959,0.8960559910509477,0.04894127581421926,0.8560000000000001,0.872660550458716,0.7943134082820409,66.5,63.18045112781955,68.13013698630138

This paper examines the ways in which climate change is being understood in India, a country that is home to 1.2 billion people, and is one of the most vulnerable to climate variability and change. It draws on a qualitative study conducted in 2009 in three Indian states, which sought to understand how climate information and adaptation practices were being developed, used and disseminated. This paper focuses on the persistence of uncertainty in the face of climate uncertainty, but also explores the way inwhich uncertainty is understood and acted upon, particularly by communities. In doing so, the paper considers the extent to which communities are able to identify, articulate and respond to the uncertainty that climate science has produced. The paper concludes by considering the implications for adaptation practice, in terms of how uncertainty should be understood, how it should inform adaptation planning and what this means",234,192,0.4888888888888889,6.559132733999383,0.8621941108004147,0.061103874980851985,0.8571428571428571,0.8569230769230768,0.751364475375572,50.501668219663955,49.06666666666667,47.36919152711545
Indian climate,Climate change studies in Indian agriculture,"Climate change studies in Indian agriculture: Current status and future directions
The current status of climate change research in India is reviewed and the future research needs are identified. Climatic changes are expected to affect agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, the extent and magnitude of these changes remain uncertain. The uncertainty is due to the complexity of the problem and its inter-disciplinary nature. A review of literature on the impact of climatic change on agriculturally important crops shows that a wide range of studies have been undertaken. These studies are based on various modeling approaches, which include statistical and mechanistic models. There is a need for a more coordinated approach to study the effects of global climate changes on Indian cropping systems, especially for croplands under rainfed conditions. This is because, in rainy regions, rains are the primary source of water for crop growth, and changes in the",235,184,0.5393939393939394,6.928640603037555,0.8790999419551458,0.05452127775730662,0.8533333333333334,0.8536170212765953,0.7618907975644952,49.58661417322834,49.23030303030303,52.191324168388064

The study of environmental archaeological remains has the potential to provide insights into the way societies adapt to climate variability and change. This article examines the role of archival data and environmental remains in the study and management of climate-related risks, with a focus on the islands and atolls of two archipelagos: the Maldives in south-western India and the Lesser Antilles in north-eastern Carribean. The analysis of past environmental conditions and archives is central to understanding the resilience of societal systems to environmental change, but archived data are often not available for many small islands.

Glacial and Holocene climate variability in South Asia is still poorly understood, in part due to the lack of reliable proxy data. Here we present new proxy records from the western Himalaya (Garhwal region, India) that extend the existing database, and which allow us to reconstruct the glacial mono-soonal variabil- ity in the region. We also present results from a series of climate model experiments that shed light on the potential causes of this vari- ability. Our results show that glaciers in this region are strongly sensitive to climate variations, particularly during the last gla- cial maximum. The model results suggest that the North African-Saharan desert was drier than today during glacio-evolutionary periods, which may have enhanced the moisture transport to South Asian mon- soon regions. These results also suggest a strong influence of North American climate on South",239,192,0.615819209039548,8.192941705230835,0.9063392916758577,0.04166451164062367,0.9314285714285714,0.9275816993464053,0.8424546771442216,88.67629482071713,96.32203389830508,82.32779677576943

Abstract. We examine the robustness of the Indian monsoon in a large set of model simulations of future climate. These simulations are forced by greenhouse gases, sulphate aerosols, ozone, or solar irradiance. The results are analysed using the standard climate diagnostics, such as the zonal mean zonally averaged sea surface temperature (SST) and the vertical structure of atmospheric temperature. All the analysts find a robust increase in SST in the eastern tropical Pacific and a decrease in Indian Southeast Asia. This is caused by the meridional expansion of convection in",247,182,0.6453900709219859,7.663582481705323,0.9115131076145513,0.04117164781590012,0.8799999999999999,0.8570940170940172,0.8034724976489509,75.42303534753,74.69503546099291,82.42076966610074

As per the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global temperature is expected to rise by 1.5°C between 2030 and 35. The report warns that this increase in temperature will have a significant impact on agriculture, which will affect food production and the availability of food.
In India, climate is an important factor in agricultural production. Wheat is the main crop in the country. India is self-sufficient in wheats. It is also a major exporter of wheaten products. In the last few years, there has been a decline in production of rice in some parts of India. This has led to an increase of prices of these products and a decrease in availabilty. However, wheate is still produced in large quantities in many parts. So, what is happening to the whe",249,187,0.5535714285714286,7.175105773237274,0.8845884770800294,0.0518631382467708,0.8599999999999999,0.8583333333333337,0.7664999318130532,50.547175114775605,59.29761904761905,46.348026315789475

Indian climate,The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change,"The globally invasive small Indian mongoose Urva auropunctata is likely to spread with climate change and is a threat to native species in Australia. The mongooses are voracious predators of native animals, and are also a health risk to humans.
The small mammal is found in many parts of the world, but is most common in India and Sri Lanka. It was introduced to Australia in the 1930s as a means of controlling snakes, particularly cane toads, in sugarcane fields. Since then, it has spread to most parts, including the tropical north.

THE DISCOVERY OF FLORIDA
In the year 528 of our era, a Spanish fleet, commanded by the admiral Don Tristan de Luna, sailed from Cadiz, in Spain, to discover the western coast of America. The fleet consisted of nine vessels, each of one hundred tons burden, with five hundred soldiers and sailors. After a long and tedious voyage, they arrived at the mouth of a river, near the present site of St. Augustine, Florida, on the 29th of August, 627. They found the river filled with fish, which they called _ciguas_ from its resemblance to a snake. It was a beautiful country and well watered, but the inhabitants were hostile.

Climate change is one of the most significant threats to the Sundabans, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Bangladesh and India. The Sundari trees, which are the main species in this mangrove ecosystem, are particularly vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall.
The Sundars are home to a large population of people who depend on its resources for their livelihoods. Climate change could have a significant impact on their lives, as it could lead to increased flooding, droughts and storms, and changes to their way of life.

It is, therefore, not surprising that the scientific community is keen to understand the complex processes that drive the phenomenon.
The mono­sons are the result of a complex interplay between the atmospheric circulation and the heating of land and oceans. These factors are simulated by the climate models used to predict the future climate.

This paper discusses the late Quartenary vegetational and climatic history based on the evidence of pollen, macrofossils and lithology. It is concluded that the vegetal cover of this region has been very sparse during the Pleistocene and Holocen and that there has always been a desert-like environment. However, the desert has undergone a series of changes in its extent and vegetative cover since the last glacial maximum. At the present time, there is a gradual increase in vegetable cover and a change in desert type from sandy to stony. These changes have been brought about by a combination of climatological",274,198,0.5679012345679012,7.228202652129153,0.8887868217324874,0.05033375086185317,0.8466666666666667,0.8510144927536232,0.7651114252067088,54.0,51.91975308641975,47.30880583546398
Indian climate,Why is the amplitude of the Indian Ocean Dipole overly large in CMIP3 and CMIP5 climate models?,"Why is the amplitude of the Indian Ocean Dipole overly large in CMIP3 and CMIP5 climate models?
The Indian ocean dipole (IOD) is a mode of variability that is defined by the difference between the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the western and eastern parts of Indian oceans. The IOD is an important mode in climate variabilities because it is known to affect the climate of many regions around the world. It is also known that the IODI is affected by ENSO.
CMIP models have been known for some time to be biased in their simulated IODi, with the models over-predicting the magnitude of IODa. This is particularly noticeable in models of CESM and MPI-ES-M. A new paper in J. Climate (Ho et al., 2014) suggests that this is because the CAMs in these models do not simulate the effect of EDS (equatorial diurnal sea-surface",275,189,0.5647058823529412,7.362863892934755,0.8887319561725952,0.049885941238523565,0.8666666666666667,0.8789041095890401,0.7800680337660382,58.65983997881253,61.33529411764706,51.33259823576584

It is also home to some of the world’s highest peaks, including Mount Everest, which is located on the border between Nepal and China.
In this paper, we present a novel approach to understanding climate variability in this region using multi temporal modelling and statistical analysis techniques. We first use multi time series analysis to extract climate related variables from multi spectral mod is data. Then we use machine leaning algorithms like neural networks to model these variables with respect to time. Finally we apply cross validation techniques to evaluate the performance of these models.

The Indian mon-soonal rainfall regime is one of the most important weather systems in the world. It is not only the main source of rains over South Asia, but also influences the climate of large parts of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The Indian summer rainy season is characterized by the onset of mono-sular convection in late May or early June and the subsequent decay in July and August. This seasonal cycle is controlled by two processes: the seasonality of solar heating and a large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern, known as the Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM). The ISM is a low-level atmos-pherically forced circulating system that is responsible for the transport of moisture from the tropical Indian Ocean into the Asian continent.

The study was led by Prof. Abhilash Kumar of the Department of Mathematics and the Centre for Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Indian Institute of Science (IISc).
Decadal forecasts are predictions of global climate conditions over a period of 10 years. These predictions have been made by various modelling centres across the globe for the last 25 years, and are used by decision makers to plan ahead for climate-sensitive sectors like agriculture, water and energy. However, these predictions suffer from low skill (i.e. low accuracy) in many regions of our planet.

The Indian mono-seasonal summer rainfall (SMR) is a major source of uncertainty in global climate models. The Indian SMR is characterized by two peaks in rainy season: the first one in late May and the second one around mid-July. This raises the question of whether the SMF is correctly simulated in regional models, which are usually forced by global models and thus, do not explicitly simulate the two monosonals. We analyze the performance of a state-of-the-art regional model, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In order to simulate two distinct monoso-nals, we introduce two different climatological rains and use a two-step methodology.

The role of the pre-conditioned sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in causing the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall anomaly is investigated using the coupled ocean-atmosphere model. The model is pre conditioned with the observed SST anomalous patterns of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian ocean dipole (IOD) and the North Indian low (NIL). The preconditions are applied to the model initial conditions and run for 10 years to simulate the ISM rains. It is found that the ENSO and IOD pre conditions give the most realistic simulation of ISMR, while the NIL precon-dition gives the least realis-tic simulation.

By the 21st century, the hill stations of colonial India had become a popular tourist destination. However, these places were once the sites of imperial rule, as well as of a unique form of settler colonialism. The British Hill Station is a book-length study of these sites as they were imagined, built, inhabited, administered, contested, photographed and consumed. It is the first major study to explore the cultural meanings of this distinctive form and place of British colonial rule.
The book examines the emergence of hill-station culture in the early nineteenth century and traces its development through the ninety years of its heyday, from the mid-nineteeth century to the Second World War.

Climate change has been a major concern for farming communities. The study was conducted to assess the awarness of Indian farmer about the climate changes and their adaptation measures. A survey was carried out in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India. 400 farms were selected through multistage random sampling method. Data were collected through structured questionnaire. Results indicated that majority of the farmland was rain fed. Farmers were aware of climate variability and change. They were also aware about adaptation strategies. However, the adoption of these adaptation techniques was very low. Majority of them were not aware regarding the government schemes and extension services. Therefore, there is need for creating awreness among farners regarding climate related issues and its adaptation.

European climate policies are increasingly framed in terms of the role of emerging economies, particularly China. This is not only due to the fact that China is the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, but also because China’ s economic growth is largely based on a high energy consumption, and because the country is often regarded as a major threat to EU climate ambitions.
This framing of climate policy is, however, problematic. It is problematical because it overlooks the European contribution to climate change. Europe’ is responsible for approximately 10% of global green house gas emissions, while China accounts for 23% and the USA 40%.

A global sustainable ocean data system would provide the information needed to address many of today’s global issues, such as climate change, food security, and marine pollution. The Indian ocean is the third largest ocean basin in terms of area and has a diverse range of climatic and oceanographic conditions. It is also the only oceanic region that has been subject to major climate changes during the last century, which have had a significant impact on the region’ s socio-economic development. As such, the establishment of a sustaining ocean monitoring system for the entire Indian region is of utmost importance.

Climate change has been identified as one of the major factors for the increase in the frequency of tropical cyclone (TC) activity in recent years. The present study aims to assess the impact of global warming on TC activity over Indian Ocean. A high-resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean model, COSMO-CLM, has incorporated the oceanic component with a higher resolution of 1/12°. This model is used to simulate the TCDD (Tropical Cyclone Days over the Indian sub-continent) and TCFDs (Total Cyclonic Frequency Days) over India.

African monitors are the key to understanding the evolution of the mono-seasonal Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) over the past 60 years. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) is the dominant driver of climate change in the tropical Indian ocean, and it is a major driver in ISM evolution. However, there is no direct relationship between IOD and ISMI. This study investigates the relationship of ISMO with IODI and the role of Africa in monosonal climate changes over India.
The results show that the ISMC is positively correlated with the IODC, which is not directly related to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian winter monies. In addition, the African monit is an important factor in determining the strength of monolithic rainfall over eastern India and",327,185,0.577922077922078,7.1718243798258845,0.8911412760924642,0.04976351669295753,0.86,0.8763076923076925,0.7791099448974181,70.51933895921238,68.24025974025975,64.54813664596273

India is a vast country, with a wide range of climates and cultures. The climate of the country is influenced by the monsoon winds from the Indian Ocean. There are four main climatic regions in the subcontinent: the hot and humid coastal plains, the cool and wet Himalayas, and the arid and semi-arid deserts.
The climate in rural India is often much hotter and more humdrum than in urban areas. This is because there is less greenery and vegetation, which helps to cool the air. In addition, rural areas are often located in valleys or other low-lying areas, where the heat can build up during the day. As a result, many rural households in india are forced to rely on traditional methods of cooling, such as shade and fans. However, as the climate becomes more extreme",329,186,0.5481927710843374,7.062969783927628,0.8824081146655184,0.05296673885742811,0.8466666666666667,0.8414084507042254,0.7569053025583995,49.28386660829511,48.57831325301205,43.994442099338684

Global climate model (GCM) simulations for the twentieth century (1901-2005) were used to assess the performance of the models in simulating the seasonal and annual mean temperature and rainfall over India. The performance was assessed using the multiobjective analysis of variance (MOANOVA) approach. In this study, the objective functions were constructed by considering the spatial pattern of rainy days, temperature, and precipitation in the Indian monsoon region. For each objective function, a weighting factor was assigned to each variable. This weighted objective was used in MOANVA to rank the GCMs. Weighting factors were selected based on the relative importance of each climatic variable for Indian agriculture.

Indian climate,Climate Change and its Impacts on Indian Agriculture.,"Climate Change and its Impacts on Indian Agriculture.
Climate change is one of the biggest challenges that we face today. It is caused by an increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere, which traps heat and causes global warming. The earth's climate is changing at a faster rate than ever before, and this is having a significant impact on agriculture in India. Climatic changes have caused a decline in crop yields, increased frequency and severity of droughts, floods, heat waves, cyclones, etc. This has led to an increased demand for food security and adaptation measures. In this blog post, we will discuss how climate change has affected Indian agricultural practices and what can be done to mitigate its effects.

The Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) is the most dominant mon-soonal system of the world, and the largest source of water vapour in
the atmosphere. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) modulates the strength of ISM, which in turn influences the Asian Summer
Monsoonic rainfall (ASMR). The IOD-ASM relationship is important for the prediction of climate change in Asia.
In this study, we investigate the correlation between the IODI and ASMR during 1960-2012. We find that the relationship
between IODi and AMR is highly correlated during this period (r=0.91).

The study was conducted in a semi-arid region of India, where climate is becoming unpredictable. The study aimed to assess the adaptive capacity of farming communities in the face of climate variability and change. A total of 320 farmer households from 16 villages were selected. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and focus group discussions. Results indicate that farms are adapting to the changing climate by adopting new technologies and management practices, which are mostly supported by the government. Farmers are also adopt-ing diversification strategies to cope with the uncertainties in climate. It was observed that the far-mers are not willing to invest in new and improved technological options.

Soil carbon (C) is an important component of soil organisms, and is the most important C pool in terrestrial ecosystems. The C dynamics in the soil are influenced by climatic factors, such as temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, evaporation, radiation, wind speed, humidity, etc. In addition, the landforms and their land uses also influence soil C.

South India is one of the most water-stressed regions in the world, with a rapidly growing population and a climate that is becoming increasingly variable. To understand how climate and land use change will affect water availabilities in this region, we developed a hydrological model for the Kaveri River basin in south India, which is the largest basins in southern India. We used the model to simulate the effects of climate, land cover and population change.
The model was calibrated using a 20-year simulation, and then used to project the hydrologic impact of a range of plausible future land and water use scenarios. In the future, the climate is likely to become warmer and drier, but the exact nature of this change is uncertain. Using the uncertainty in climate projections, it was possible to assess the range and likelihood of hydro-climatic conditions that might be expected in future.",340,193,0.45263157894736844,6.239095750946101,0.8489283134581485,0.06629575329192372,0.8914285714285713,0.8787951807228909,0.7356836751421458,51.274927984928276,52.142105263157895,48.043904049295776

The Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) are a key feature of the South Asian summer climate, providing the majority of rainfall to the region. In recent years, the ISM has become more active, with an increased number of extreme rainy days and more frequent heavy rains. These changes are likely related to a shift to more moisture-rich atmospheric circulation patterns. However, it remains unclear whether the observed changes in ISMA are linked to changes of ISMC. Here we show that the frequency of synopses with ISMS-like features has declined over the last 60 years. The polewards shift of these synopse is associated with a weakening of an atmosphric circulatry pattern, which has a large impact on the Indian monnsoonal rainstorms.

The Indian state of Uttarakhand is one of the most climate-vulnerable regions in India, with a high degree of dependence on agriculture and livestock. In this context, the research project aims to contribute to climate adaptation and food security in smallholder farming in Tehrigarhwali villages by promoting agro-ecological practices.
India is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases. The country is affected by the consequences of climate warming: more frequent and intense droughts, floods and landslides, as well as increasingly unpredictable rainfall patterns. Agriculture is particularly affected. Untimely rains, late frosts and hailstorms destroy crops, reduce yields and reduce farmers' incomes. At the same time, farmer' s dependence is increasing: in 2018, 66",357,197,0.6114649681528662,7.661634090889173,0.9027148535064967,0.044303092988227745,0.8533333333333334,0.859849624060151,0.8128714662306649,78.5,69.71974522292993,71.48575078616352

The Indian mon-soonal region is known to experience drastic climatic variations due to its unique geography and seasonal variability. The present study is aimed at investigating the impact of anthropogenic forcing on Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) using the outputs of 20th century climate model simulations from Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 05). The results of the study show that the models are able to simulate the ISM variabilities and the modelled ISMS drifts are in agreement with the observed ISMM drift. However, the simulated ISMP drifting is not in accordance with that of ISMA drifters. Further, it is found that ISMD variabil-ity is more sensitive to the anthro-pogenically induced forcing as compared to ISMC vari-ability and this is in line with findings of earlier studies",363,193,0.6329113924050633,7.9555728417573,0.9096461707770891,0.04109500738383397,0.8933333333333332,0.8788059701492544,0.8131905080877436,68.68036142078358,78.18987341772151,55.31469102792632

Abstract. The Indian Summer Monsoons (ISM) is the most important source of rainfall over the Indian subcontinent. Regional climate models are used to study the mono-seasonal precipitation variability. In this study, the performance of the Regional Climate Model (RCMT2) over India in the simulation of ISM is evaluated. To understand the role of different forcings in monosonal precipitations, two simulations are performed with different forcing data. First simulation is forced by the observed sea surface temperature (",384,193,0.6054421768707483,7.340596279696671,0.8994483527588337,0.04639451991133984,0.8720000000000001,0.8481300813008137,0.8031853268592767,57.77824229589601,68.06802721088435,57.495262201453784

The paper presents an analysis of extreme wave conditions over Indian ocean for the period 1989-2006. The extreme values of significant wave hights (SWH) and mean wave period (Mwp) are estimated using the wavelet analysis. It is found that the SWH and Mwp are significantly correlated with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. Moreover, the analysis shows that ENSO events have significant impact on extreme S and S' wave parameters over eastern Indian region.

Indian climate,Climatic oscillations and tuna catch rates in the Indian Ocean: a wavelet approach to time series analysis,"Climatic oscillations and tuna catch rates in the Indian Ocean: a wavelet approach to time series analysis
The Indian ocean is a vast area with a great diversity of fishing grounds. The tunas are an important group of pelagic fishes that are exploited by commercial and artisanal fisheries, and they are also of interest to scientists because of their ecological role and their economic value. However, tune catches are variable and difficult to predict.
Tuna are highly migratory and pelagiic species that have a large distribution in tropical and subtropical waters. They are important to the economy of the countries that exploit them, but their catch is highly variable. This variability is due to several factors, such as environmental factors (temperature, salinity, etc.), the fishers' behaviour, or the presence of other species in their habitat. In this paper, we analyse the relationship between the catch rate of tunes and climatic factors in order to improve the knowledge of these factors.

Solar activity has a profound influence on weather and climate. The sun is the main source of energy for the earth’s climate system. It is also the source for many atmospheric processes such as cloud formation, precipitation, atmos-pherically induced circulation and solar radiation.
The sun’ s radiation is a major component of the energy budget of our planet. However, its role in the climate is not well understood. This is because the sun has an irregular and highly variable activity. Therefore, there are many solar cycles which are closely related to the global climate of Earth. These solar activity cycles have a direct impact on the weather, climate and other atmosph-eric parameters. Sol-ar cycles are characterized by the variation of solar magnetic activity, which is related with the solar wind and the Sun’ magnetic field.

Climate change is the change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years). Climatic change may be a reference to a change within the average weather conditions, or in average climate conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.) in a region.
The climate change that is occurring now is of a natural origin and is not due to any anthropogenic activity. The climate is changing in response to natural forces and has always been changing. It is now changing at an accelerated rate. Climatologists are not sure whether this change will be beneficial or detrimental to the world. However, the fact that the climate has been relatively stable for the last few thousand years is a good indication that it is more likely to be detrimental.

Climate change is a global phenomenon which is affecting forest ecosystems. Forest fringes are most vulnerable to climate change because of their proximity to human settlements, which are more prone to the impacts of climate variability. The aim of this study was to assess the perceptual differences in climate changes and their impact on forest-fringe people and to identify their response to such changes.
This study used a survey methodology to collect data from forest dwellers of the Eastern Indian Hindu Kush Himmalaya. A total of 138 respondents from 25 villages were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Statistical analysis was carried out to find the difference in percep-tions of climatic changes among respondent groups and the association between per",398,196,0.5506329113924051,6.921348372328851,0.882138130646484,0.053606299069027676,0.8533333333333334,0.8632835820895516,0.7837519966603612,55.88238705905994,62.37341772151899,50.230769230769226
Indian climate,"Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries. Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey","Climate Change Mitigation in Developing Countries. Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey
In the past few decades, developing countries have experienced rapid economic growth. This growth has been accompanied by increasing energy consumption, which is largely responsible for rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2005, the global GHg emitted by developing nations was 42% of the total. By 1990, their share was only 31%. The rapid growth in GDP in developing economies has led to an increase in energy demand.
The effects of climate change in the developing world are numerous. For example, in China alone, it is estimated that more than 80 million people will be affected by climate-related disasters. Climatic changes will also impact agriculture and forestry. It will cause a decrease in crop yields and a rise in food prices. As a result, there will likely be a negative impact on the health and well-",399,191,0.5722222222222222,7.677166722749278,0.8925028882986232,0.04766479946797061,0.8571428571428571,0.8571794871794872,0.7831900037093267,69.27143187306243,59.53333333333333,57.8781862745098

Sustainable fishing, marine conservation and food systems are key for a blue and green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Indian ocean is a hotspot for fish production and marine biodiversity. However, unsustained fish stocks, overfishing and poorly managed fishery resources are threatening the livelihoods of millions of people.
The Indian oceans’ fishermen and women are among the most vulnerable to the impacts and risks of climate variability and change. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry and temperature, and increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including cyclones, floods and droughts. These impact fish, fishers, communities and the environment. While there is growing awareness of the need to tackle climate-related impact, there are still significant knowledge gaps and limited resources for ocean climate resilience.

The objective of this study is to assess the sensitivity of the indicative climate sensitive indications with respect to the vulnerabilty index. For this purpose, we have used the data of 1330 watersheds of Indian states of Haryana and Rajasthan. In the present study, four climate indices, viz. temperature, rainfall, runoff and evaporation, have being used to determine the impact of climate on agriculture. These indices have then been used for determining the overall vulnerablity index for the watersheeds. A sensitvity analysis has been carried out for these climate indicies.

A study on the implications for water management of the impacts of global warming on rainfall and runoff in the Indian Himalayan region was carried out. The study is based on a hydrological model that simulates the seasonal variations in runoffs of 109 major rivers in 22 states and 6 union territories of India. It is found that the average run off in most of these rivers will increase in response to climate warmi ng. However, the increase is not uniform and will be greater in some rivers than in others. In addition, a number of rivers may experience a decrease in average annual run-off. These variations are attributable to the complex topography of Indian rivers and their catchments. This study has important implicat ions for the management and development of water and energy resources in this region.

Climate change is arguably the most pressing environmental issue of the twenty-first century. This article compares newspaper reporting of climate issues in twenty seven countries over a six-year period. It focuses on the extent to which the media frame climate as a social problem and the level of attention given to climate stories. The results show that the framing of global warming as an issue is highly variable across countries, and that countries with high levels of framed attention also tend to have high rates of actual attention. However, the findings also indicate that frames do not always predict the attention that climate receives in the news. We find that there is no consistent relationship between the degree of media framings and attention to the issue. Countries that frame global climate war as social issue are not necessarily more likely to report on it. Instead, media attention is determined by a combination of",412,195,0.53125,7.361215932167729,0.8796912761713852,0.0526906928950963,0.8914285714285713,0.8866666666666655,0.7862670569312714,65.6007696007696,64.81770833333333,58.78614678288642

India is one of few countries in which hydraulic power generation has the potential to increase under the influence of climate changes. This study assesses the impact of future climatic changes on the hydroelectric power production of 16 large rivers of North India. The results show that the power potential of these rivers will increase significantly under all climate conditions. In the best case, the increase will be 24.5% and in worst case it will decrease by 7.7%. The increase is expected to be maximum in winter months and minimum in summer months. However, there is no significant change of hydro power in monsoon season.

This study aims to understand the vulnerabilities of coasts to climate change and to identify the most vulnerable coastlines of India. A coastline is defined as vulner- able if it is exposed to both sea level rise (SLR) and climatic extrem- es. The study area is the Indian mainland coast, which is divided into 30 coast districts. For each coast district, a vulnera- bility index is calculated based on the combination of SLR and extreme climate indices.
The vulnerabil- ity index for each district is then compared with other districts using the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test.

Indian agricultural economy is one of the most important sectors of Indian economy. It is the largest source of income for the farmers of India. Agriculture sector has been a major contributor in India’s economic development and growth. The Indian agriculturists are very much dependent on the monsoon. A major portion of agricultures in the country is rain-fed. Hence, agriculturer’ face a lot of challenges due to climate changes. Climate change has a significant impact on Indian Agricultural sector. This paper aims to study the impact of climatic changes on India agriculturation sector from the year 82 to the present.

The Indonesia Through Flow (ITF) is a major ocean current that transports heat from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. The ITF is strongly influenced by seasonal and interannal variations in the strength of the trade winds. In this study, we investigate the impact of inter-annually varying ITCZs on the ITP over a 26-year period (1986–2011) using a coupled atmosphere-ocean model. We find that the intermittency of trade-wind-induced ITVs is not directly related to changes in surface wind stress. Instead, it is associated with changes of air-sea fluxes, which are governed by oceanic and atmospheric processes. Intermitentcy is controlled by a combination of processes that are associated to ocean-atmosphere coupling, such as ocean dynamics, ocean mixed layer depth, surface",424,191,0.5748502994011976,7.4287030323277135,0.891823702559835,0.04866850938676575,0.8466666666666667,0.8674125874125876,0.8004627365969176,57.7283950617284,68.40718562874251,66.80297619047619

Indian climate,Migration as adaptation strategy to cope with climate change: A study of farmers' migration in rural India,"Migration as adaptation strategy to cope with climate change: A study of farmers' migration in rural India
Migration is increasingly being seen as an adaptation to climate-related stresses, and it is argued that migration can play a role in enhancing adaptation. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this claim. This paper examines the migration decisions of households in the Indian state of Rajasthan. The data come from a survey of 147 households from three villages, with a focus on the impact of climate on migration. A multinomial logistic regression analysis is conducted to identify the factors that affect migration to different places. It is found that households are more likely to migrate to the urban areas of the state. Migrants are found to be better off than non-migrants in terms of income and assets. Further, it was found from the regression results that the main drivers of migration are income, age, caste and gender.

The country is now one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and, in 2018, it was the sixth largest economy in purchasing power parity terms. This growth has led to a significant increase in urbanisation and income inequality. In 73% of Indian households, the head of household is a woman, but only 4.5% are women’ leaders, and 90% live in rural areas.

Abstract. Regional Climate Models (RCMS) are useful for providing sub-regionally specific information on the climate, particularly for the mono-seasonal monosonous regions. However, the uncertainty associated with down-scalings of RCMs is not well understood. In this study, we use the 50-km resolution MRI-AGCM2.0 model to investigate the role that domain scale plays on RSM downscalling uncertainty.

Ashok Kumar, Ramesh K.S.
Safety climate has been used as a tool to measure safety attitudes in various industries. The present study is an attempt to develop a safety attitude scale to assess safety-related attitudinal constructs among officers of Indian ships. A scale consisting of 28 items was developed after conducting a literature survey and a pilot study. Data were collected from 156 officers from Indian vessels and analysed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analaysis. Factor analysis revealed that the scale consists of three factors namely safety precautions, safety rules and safety measures. Convergent validity was established using a set of safety related variables. Further, a good correlation was found between safety rule scores and accident rates. Internal consistency of the scales was also found to be high. It is concluded that",438,186,0.5337423312883436,6.814365914895229,0.8767426635776644,0.055717397646094076,0.8533333333333334,0.8492086330935258,0.7722673697104452,50.38468992248062,53.66257668711656,48.68842625264644

Climate modes are important in understanding the variabilities of oceanic processes. In this study, the effects of three climate indices (Southern Oscillation Index, Indian Summer Monsoon Index and El Niño-South Oceans Index) on the inter-annually variableness of equatorward surface current in Indian ocean are investigated. The results show that the variations of Indian summer monsoons and the El Nino-south oceania index are the main factors that control the surface curren variabilty in equitorial Indian ocaean. While the Southern Ocillations Index has no significant effect on this current.

The climates of the Indian subcontinent have been described by various scholars since the 19th century, but most of these classifications were based on the work of two pioneers: Sir John Eliot Howard and Sir George King. In this paper, we present a revised climatalogy for India, based upon an analysis of daily temperature and precipitation data from 235 weather stations across the country. We describe the development of a new classification system, and compare the performance of our new system with that of Howard's and King' s. Our results show that the new climatolgy is more consistent with the observed climate of each of 650 districts in the sub-continet.

The study has been conducted for three different future periods, i.e. 1981-2100, using the A1B scenario. In the study, the future wind speed is predicted using two different methods. One is based on statistical downscaling of the global circulation models (GCMs) and the other is by applying the statistical relationships between wind and temperature. It has also been observed that the mean wind is higher in the northern region as compared to the southern region of Indian coast.

The Indian mono-soonal (IM) rains are the second largest source of rainy season precipitation in the Indian sub-continent, with about 50% of the raining season raindrop falling during the IM season. The IM rainstorms are one of most important sources of monetary losses in India, and are a key component of agricultural productivity in many parts of India. It is therefore important to understand the nature of Indian IM precipitations and their variability under different climate scenarios.
In the present study, we have used the outputs of 12 different global climate models (GCMs) to examine the changes in IM rain precipitations in a warming world. We have analysed the precipitative responses to climate forcing in 20 and 40 years from now, as well as in doubled CO2 conditions.

The Indian subcontinent is the world’s third largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its rate of emission is increasing. This is in part due to the extensive area of the Hindu Kush Hajar (HKH) region, which is characterized by high elevations, cold temperatures, and high rainfall. The HK region is also a biodiversity hotspot, hosting a large number of endemic species. In addition, the region has a high proportion of soil carbon (C) relative to total organically-bound C (TOC), and therefore, it is a significant source of atmospheric CO2.
In this study, we assess the role of climate and soil characteristics on the amount of C stored in soils, focusing on both the potential for C to be released to atmosphere as CO₂ and the storage of new C in soil. We use a range of different methods",460,196,0.5555555555555556,7.637626158259733,0.8878643583497265,0.04925874066707587,0.8857142857142858,0.8736969696969693,0.7873248976491147,73.46650263901805,63.97883597883598,55.4713963963964

The impact of climate change on water-borneo diarrohea (WBD) in India is not well understood. This study investigates the relationship between climate and WBD in the northern part of the country, and proposes adaptation measures to reduce the risk of WBD. The study was conducted in three districts of Uttar Pradesh, India. A multivariate time series analysis was used to assess the impacts of temperature and rainfall on WDB. Adaptation strategic planning was carried out by applying the MARTIN model to determine the effectiveness of adaptation options in reducing the incidence of diaroheal disease.

Four climate scenarios of the future Indian mon-soonal rainfall distribution are presented based on the coupled regional atmospheric‐oceanic model (COSMO-CL) for 2050 and 55 years later, 100 years from now. The model simulations are forced by global warming and two different global scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8. 6). The results show that the mono-soual rains will be less intense over the entire region in the year 3015, but the seasonal cycle will not change significantly. For the high-emission scenario RPC8,6, the summer rainy season will shift to the north and to a lesser extent to south.

Abstract. A multi model downscaling approach has been used to produce a set of climate projection datasets for India over the period 2021–22 to 3070–79. The prognostic variables used for the downscale are mean annual temperature and annual total precipitation. These variables are derived from the outputs of 11 GCMs and three RCMs. In addition, the RCP4.5 and RPC8. 5 scenarios of the IPCC AR5 have been considered.
The down scaled datasets are validated with the observations of station data from 600 stations and satellite data of precipitable water from CMORPH. Both the station and the satellite datasets have shown good agreement",464,180,0.5815602836879432,6.905645752745456,0.8904693993806813,0.05096297533106928,0.8639999999999999,0.8341880341880347,0.7957058935263235,47.0,51.723404255319146,49.073997519636215

This study investigates the causes of the Indian ocean warmer than normal (WON) event during the period 29 May to 9 August 5 in 88. The results show that the warmed Indian oceans are mainly caused by the anomalous heating of tropical Indian and the surrounding ocean regions. It is suggested that anomalously heated tropical Indo-Pacific ocean region and anomaly of low-level zonal winds may play an important role in the WON event.

In tropical regions, the thermal environment is characterized by high temperatures and high humidity. The human body has a limited ability to dissipate heat, and it is therefore necessary to provide cooling for thermal well-being. In this paper, a thermal discomfort model has been developed to predict the disconfort level experienced by a person in a tropical environment. This model is based on the psychophysiological and physiologically equivalent temperature concepts. A new method has also been proposed to determine the appropriate value of the equivalent thermal resistance (ETR) of a human. It is found that the physio-equivalent temperature (PET) is higher than the thermophy-siological equivalent temperate (TET), and the PET is also higher in the evening than in mornings. An ETR value (0.124) has therefore",468,192,0.4941860465116279,6.481189239135698,0.8630706213482976,0.061251458840132195,0.88,0.8694594594594595,0.7712444326696293,57.333333333333336,55.03488372093023,51.47662065476621

Natural disasters, such as floods, droughts and heat waves, cause large mortalties. In the Indian state of Kerala, mortaility in the summer of 2018 was 12% higher than in other summers. The main cause of this increase was the heat wave.
Heat waves are becoming more frequent in many parts of the world. According to the IPCC, extreme heat events will become more common in Europe and North America. However, the impact of heat on human health is highly unequally distributed. While heat has a negative effect on the health of all people, it is especially problematic for the elderly and children. Those who live in urban areas are more likely to suffer from heat than those living in rural areas.

India's manufactured exports have been growing at a faster rate than the global growth in the past decade. The share of manufactures in GDP has increased from 16.5 percent in 2004-05 to 30 percent by 4Q 09. This paper examines the role of investment and investor-specific factors in explaining the growth of India' s manufacture exports. We find that investments in infrastructure and human capital are positively associated with the export growth. Further, the level of domestic investors' participation in investing in exporting firms is found to be positivity associated. However, we find no significant association between the investee fir''s foreign ownership and export performance.

Climate change is a global phenomenon which has been changing the face of the earth for millions of years. The earth's climate has undergone many changes in the past, which have been caused by natural forces like solar radiation, volcanic eruptions, and plate tectonics. However, the current climate changes are caused primarily by the increase in greenhouse gases in atmosphere. These gasses trap heat in earth’s atmosphere and thus, result in increase of global temperature. Climate change will have a significant impact on the biosphere, especially on plants and animals. It is important to understand the impact of this phenomenal on natural resources and bioresources.

Climate change will affect India in a variety of ways, from increased risks of droughts and floods to higher temperatures and more intense rainfall events. India will also be affected by sea level rise, which will increase the severity of coastal flooding and erosion. The impacts of climate change on India are likely to be more severe than the impact of the economic reforms of 1991.
The authors assess the vulnerabilities to climate impact and the adaptive capacity of India. They analyse the potential impact on the economy, the health of Indians, agriculture, fisheries and forestry, as well as the wider environment and biodiversity. Based on this analysis, they identify a range of adaptation strategies that will help India to cope with the effects",479,188,0.5408805031446541,6.8202436371760395,0.8787594159507806,0.055074381041832765,0.8066666666666666,0.8328888888888899,0.7495172992317815,39.75,44.9622641509434,39.372549019607845

Indian climate,Climate change and rice yields in diverse agro-environments of India. I. Evaluation of impact assessment models,"Climate change and rice yields in diverse agro-environments of India. I. Evaluation of impact assessment models.
Rice is the staple food of over half of the world's population. The impacts of climate change on rice production in India are expected to be severe due to the large share of rice in the total food grain production and the high vulnerability of this crop to temperature and rainfall extremes. To assess the impact of projected climate changes on the rice yield, impact models have been used. This paper presents an evaluation of five impact modeling studies conducted in different agrocenoses of india. These studies were conducted at different time periods, using different methods and models and hence the results are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, the paper highlights the similarities and differences in impact results and suggests the need for a standardized impact study protocol.",483,193,0.5189873417721519,6.523569730240986,0.8704467212004986,0.05892382198579154,0.8333333333333334,0.8211940298507461,0.7410530098008833,46.62691131498471,46.765822784810126,43.24720251590726

The impact of climate on hydroclimatic variables, such as precipitation and temperature, is an important aspect of hydro-climatological research. However, the uncertainty in hydrogeological parameters, which is another important factor affecting the hydroenvironment, has been rarely considered in the literature. In this study, we use a Bayes' theorem-based method to quantify the parameter uncertainties in an integrated hydroeconomic model (IHEM) and assess the impacts of the unmeasured hydro geological parameter variations on the river discharge of major Indian rivers. The results show that the IHEMS can capture the overall trends in river flow, but it is unable to accurately reproduce",484,181,0.6024096385542169,7.7615052570633285,0.9008570396973916,0.0446568168625219,0.8333333333333334,0.8335211267605632,0.7944866749464762,70.51643856045663,59.69879518072289,46.376480137509546

Climate change is evident in many parts of the world, but in tropical regions, where a large fraction of global warming is expected to occur, the evidence is less conclusive. Here, we present a new analysis of satellite-based out-going radiation (OLR) data from 1979 to 2010 in order to investigate the recent trends in surface temperature and atmospheric circulation in two tropical ocean regions. The western tropical Pacific (WTP) and the Indian (IO) Ocean have been selected as representative regions for the study because of their geographical location and because the two regions have different seasonal cycles. We find that the WTP has experienced a cooling trend of −0.15 ± 03 K decade−1, whereas the IO has warmed at a rate of ∼0·11 K per de",487,184,0.5914634146341463,7.574427451597394,0.8970256463079823,0.046492827827472244,0.8733333333333332,0.8751428571428578,0.8225144928208675,67.74628877383132,80.34146341463415,70.25597402597401

The Indian Walker Circulation (IWC) is a major source of moisture for the East African region, and it has been identified as a key factor in the precipitation regime of Kenya. This study investigates the representation of IWW in coupled atmosphere-ocean models. The results show that the IWM is well represented in models with both ocean and atmosphere components. However, the model results indicate that most models have problems in reproducing the strength of Walker convection. In models where the Walker cell is represented well, precipitable water (PW) anomalies are generally associated with the position of convec-tive activity in a given model. For the couple models, PW anomaly patterns are related to the location of low-level convergence in their model, which is associated to anomalous Walker-cell con-vective intensity.

India has been an active participant in climate change negotiations and has also contributed to the research on climate science and mitigation and adaptation. However, there is a lack of consensus on the country’s climate policy objectives and strategies. This paper presents a conceptual framework to examine the Indian climate research landscape and analyses the gaps and challenges. The analysis suggests that the climate-related research in the public domain is primarily conducted by governmental agencies and academic institutions. While some of the agency-led research is policy relevant, it is not systematic or integrated. There is no clear-cut division between research conducted in South and North India, but the latter has a stronger focus on adaptation and local-level miti-gation.

India’s Defence Budget: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly

The Union Budgets are the most anticipated documents in the Indian calendar. They are eagerly awaited, debated and dissected. In the first of a two-part series, Aerospace and Defense Focus analyses the defence budget and its impact on the industry.

India and Russia have been partners in defence for more than five decades now. However, the relationship has not always been smooth. The recent announcement of the joint production of BrahMos cruise missiles in India is a welcome development. This will not only improve the capability of both countries but also provide an opportunity to India to improve its technology and manufacturing capabilities.
The relationship between India and the Soviet Union began in 1947, when the Indian government signed a trade agreement with the USSR. In 2008, India became the world's largest arms importer, spending $4.1 billion on defence equipment. India'

Bhattacharya, Somdutta
This paper examines the relationship between defence expenditure and growth for India. It does so by applying the methodology of the ‘new’ defence economics, which is based on the premise that defence is a cost rather than a benefit to the economy. The paper estimates the defence multiplier for a panel of 25 Indian states for the period 1990-2011. We find that the impact of defence on growth is positive, but that it is statistically insignificant. However, the estimated defence effect is sensitive to both the specification of our model and the choice of states. This suggests that there is scope for further research on defence and its impact on economic development in India, using a broader range of models and data.

The role and importance of the armed forces is not limited to the military domain, but also extends to areas such as disability rehabilitation, relief and rescue, medical aid, and civil-military cooperation. This is due to their unique skill sets, infrastructure, equipment, manpower, logistics, training, experience, discipline, morale, leadership, esprit de corps, etc. The armed services have been a part of India’s disastrous response for decades.

India's Defence Industry
The Indian defence market is expected to be worth $100 billion in the next decade, with an annual growth rate of 7-8 per cent.
In the past, the defence sector was considered a ""closed shop"", with the government controlling all aspects of it. However, in recent years, there has been a gradual opening up of the sector, and it is now possible for private companies to enter the market. This has led to a number of new players entering the field, including some of India' s largest companies. In addition, foreign companies are also increasingly active in India, particularly in areas such as aviation and shipbuilding. As a result, India is becoming an increasing important player in global defence markets.",14,187,0.5751633986928104,7.114378334399101,0.8900491139027654,0.05032787905250607,0.8666666666666667,0.866666666666667,0.7772139438618881,51.54904306220096,51.57516339869281,50.65948012232416

The liberalisation of the economy and the opening up of new avenues for private players in defence sector have resulted in a new scenario. There is a need for better understanding of supply chains and their relationship with customers. This paper provides an analysis of how a defence PSU has adopted the concept of SCOR and how it has helped in managing customer relationships.

In his blog, the writer argues that the Indian defence establishment has been systematically underfunded for years. He also arguably suggests that a part of the budget should be used to create a ‘peace dividend’.
The Indian military has always been under-resourced and undervalued. It is not just the army, but also the navy and the air force. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has not been able to replace its ageing fleet of MiG 21s and Mirages, while the Navy has had to operate with an age-old fleet, which includes 1960s vintage destroyers and frigates. And the Army, well, it is a story of its own. So, there is an urgent need to increase the defence expenditure. However, this does not mean that we should increase it blind",17,200,0.5823529411764706,7.592953389588967,0.8947235578765801,0.04719966510524967,0.86,0.8767123287671232,0.8013851673719515,62.11424762346395,69.65882352941176,63.16948282300224

India’s defence industry is one of the largest in the world, with a total defence budget of around $60 billion. However, India’ s defence manufacturing industry has been slow to develop, and the country’ S defence procurement policies have been criticised as being too restrictive and too focused on Western suppliers.

SINGAPORE-INDIA DEFENCE RELATIONS: THE SINGA
This paper examines the Singapore-India defense relations in the context of the evolving regional security environment. It begins by outlining the background to the relationship and the main areas of cooperation. This is followed by a discussion of some of Singapore's concerns about India' s defense posture and capabilities. The paper then examined some implications for the future of bilateral defense co-operation and concludes with some recommendations for further enhancing cooperative ties.
Singapores defense policy is based on a three-pronged strategy of deterrence, diplomacy and defense. In the event of a threat to its territorial integrity, Singapore would duly respond, but would also seek to resolve the problem through diplomatic means. If this proved unsuccessful, it would take all necessary",21,193,0.6075949367088608,7.6373499280870085,0.9015827182880112,0.044762451723800355,0.84,0.8767164179104476,0.8114428680385435,68.14808591562138,77.0379746835443,69.7399011915141

11.1 Introduction: a new look at the frontiers of empire
In the late 1870s, the British government began to question the value of its control over the North-West Frontier of India. The region was remote, and its inhabitants, many of them, at least, hostile to British rule. It was difficult to defend, because of both the terrain and because the local tribesmen were able to move quickly and with great mobility. In addition, it was also a place where the costs of maintaining an army were high, while the benefits were uncertain. And, finally, its strategic importance was limited.
Nevertheless, for more than a century the Frontiers had been the responsibility of Britain. They had to be defended, or so it seemed. There were two reasons for this. First, British India was the 'jewel in the crown' of a",28,190,0.5445026178010471,7.525175895041185,0.8842629696962797,0.050738858959949125,0.8342857142857143,0.8304191616766468,0.7482600030206286,49.979905046834176,47.68586387434555,46.267834793491865

Indian Air Force: A Force That Does Not Exist

IAF’s woes are not a secret. They are well known and have been well documented in the media. The lack of fighter squadrons, the shortage of spares, a large number of aircraft undergoing major repairs and the inability to replace them, are just some of the problems that the IAF is facing.
The IA is a force that does not exist. It has been decimated by the Pakistan Army and is now in a state of virtual collapse. Despite this, there are no plans to rebuild it. Instead, it is being disbanded and replaced by a new army that will be made up of volunteers.

India and the United States have been trying to find a common ground in their defence relationship for some time now. The two countries have shared interests in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) and have a convergent view on the need to counter China’s growing influence in South Asia. However, the US has been unable to overcome the ‘hangover’ of the Cold War, and its strategic vision for the region remains wedded to the notion of containing China.
The US is also concerned about India’S growing defence ties with Russia, which has emerged as a key partner for New Delhi. India has also been cautious about the security implications of its growing tilt towards the West. This has led to a situation where the two sides are unable either to move forward or to backtrack.

India’s Defence Expenditures in Global Perspective
The 2015 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) Yearbook states that India’S defence spending of USD 55.2 billion is the fourth largest in the world, and that it is likely to increase to US$ 65 billion by 1922. India is also likely
to be the second largest importer of major weapons by the year 912, with an import of 8.5 per cent of global imports. The Stockholm Yearbooks have been issued annually since 31. It is a compilation of information about the military expenses and imports of weapons of countries around the globe.

India and Israel have signed an agreement to deepen cooperation in the defence sector. The deal, which was signed during the visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, will help India build its defence capabilities.
The agreement, signed by Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and her Israe

India and israel have been cooperating in defence for several years and this agreement is a significant step forward in deepening the relationship between the two countries.

Amidst the controversy over the Rafale deal, the defence budget for 19-24 has been announced. The allocation for capital outlay is Rs 4.05 lakh crore, which is a 6.8% increase over last year’s allocation.
The Defence Ministry has also decided to introduce a new category of capital acquisitions, “Buy (Indian-IDDM)”. This will allow the procurement of defence equipment from the private sector. It is expected that this will provide an impetus to the ‘Make in India’ initiative and help in boosting the economy. However, this is not the first time that such a category has come into existence. In 80s, a similar category called “Make” was introduced. But, it did not yield the desired results. So, what will be different this time?

In the last 10 years, India has made a remarkable transition from a net importer to a major exporter of defence equipment. This has been achieved by the indigenisation of many products, including radars, airborne warning and control systems, missiles, artillery guns, armoured vehicles, naval ships and submarines. It is also the only country in the world to have built a fully indigeneous aircraft carrier. The government has now set a target of 60 per cent indigeous content in all defence acquisitions by 2025. With a large number of projects in various stages of execution, this target appears achievable. In the process, the country has also emerged as a hub for the global aerospace and defence industry.

India is the only country in the world to have been created as a result of an idea. It is also the largest democracy in human history. Yet, the very idea that India is a country has come under attack in recent years, especially from within the country.
The Envisionment of A Nation is an attempt to explain why this is so. What is it about the concept of India that has led to its rejection by so many people? The book takes a long historical perspective to answer this question, and traces the origins of this idea to the eighteenth century. The author argues that the Indian idea has been a source of inspiration for many thinkers, including the founding fathers of modern India, who drew on the ideas of Enlightenment philosophers like Montesquieu and Rousseau to construct a new nation.

Criminal law is an integral part of our legal system. It is the most important area of law, because it is concerned with the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, which are guaranteed by the Constitution of India. The criminal code is a body of rules and regulations that set out the guidelines for the conduct of the criminal process. These rules are meant to ensure that the accused person is treated fairly and that justice is done. However, the rules of evidence and procedure are often complex and difficult to understand, and it can be difficult for an accused to defend himself against the charges brought against him. This is where the role of a criminal lawyer comes in. A criminal attorney is someone who is trained in law to represent people accused of crimes. They are responsible for preparing the case and presenting it in court.

During the Russians– Japanese war, the Indian government was in a dilemma. It was not sure how to respond to the war. The British government did not want to take any side. But the government of the United States of America was eager to help the Japanese. In 1904, Lord Curzon, Viceroy of British India, sent a telegram to Lord Lansdowne, Secretary of State for India. Curson said that the British Empire was facing a grave danger. He said, “The British people are ready to give all the support to Russia in this war.”
But Lord Curron was anxious. “If the people of Russia lose the confidence of their government, they may turn against us. We cannot afford to lose their confidence.” He wanted to know how the Viceregal Government of Bengal would",51,193,0.5056179775280899,6.745785200962753,0.868390126036164,0.05848236054994469,0.7885714285714285,0.8116883116883115,0.7462862994770016,40.78257761437908,41.42134831460674,38.06477702191988

Their navies have been in close contact with each other for decades, but defence relations have not been as robust.

India's defence expenditure is the fourth largest in the world and has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 12.7 per cent over the last decade. The defence budget for 2015-16 was Rs. 3,00,290 crore, which is 5.8 per of the total expenses of government. It is a fact that the defence sector is one of those sectors which are most affected by the fluctuations in economic conditions. During the period of recession, the government of India has increased the allocation for defence in order to boost the economy and employment opportunities.
The defence economy is not only dependent on the size of defence budgets, but also on its growth. In the recent years, India' s defence growth has remained stagnant.

The Indian defence sector is one of the most important sectors of our economy. It contributes to around 2.5% of India’s GDP and is a major employer. However, the sector has been plagued by corruption and inefficiency. In order to turn things around, India needs to make some major changes. First, it needs a new defence strategy. Second, we need to reform our defence procurement process. Third, our military needs more money and better equipment. Finally, there needs be more transparency in defence deals.

The North-West Frontier, the borderland between British India and Afghanistan, was a theatre of war for most of the nineteenth century. It was also a region of great strategic importance, both in terms of Britain's imperial interests and as a buffer zone against Russian expansionism. In the 1890s, however, British policy in the region was severely criticized in Parliament and in public opinion. The situation was exacerbated by the Boer War, which caused a major political crisis in India. After the war, a number of reforms were introduced to deal with the situation, including the creation of a new political structure for the Northwest Frontiers, and a more flexible system of defence.

There is also a strong emphasis on innovation and R&D. This has resulted in a new set of challenges for the defence services and defence industries. In order to meet these challengers, there needs to be a change in how innovations are created and implemented.
Innovation is the process of creating new ideas, products, or services that are better than what already exists. It is important for businesses to constantly innovate in order for them to stay competitive in today’s market. However, innovating can be difficult for many business owners because they don’t have the time or resources to do it. That’ why it’ important to hire an innovative consultant who can help you come up with new and creative ideas that will help your",82,196,0.5543478260869565,7.519539763899754,0.8868705250177025,0.0499508056820079,0.8742857142857143,0.8607499999999998,0.8153354891903581,54.488367468681645,64.77173913043478,52.80225988700565

India’s Defence Budget
A recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) has said that India’­s military spending is expected to increase by 6.8% in 2018, making it the world’’ s sixth largest spender.
The report has been released a day after India and the United States signed a major defence pact to deepen military cooperation between the two countries. India is set to sign the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) with the U.S. during the annual bilateral dialogue. This paves the way for the Indian military to use U.S. bases and ports for supplies, repairs and maintenance, and allows the American military access to Indian bases.

The Indian defence industry has been undergoing a transformation. In recent years, the Indian government has taken various steps to enhance the capabilities of domestic defence manufacturers. One of these initiatives is the “Make-in-Indian” (MII) programme, which aims to promote the development of a robust domestic industry capable of meeting the country’s defence requirements.
In this context, it is important to examine the role of India-Kenya defence relations in the context of MII.

The joint forces of India are evolving in a way that it is becoming more and more difficult to distinguish between the three services. The jointmanship is being practiced at the operational level, and in the training and education of the officers. It is not that the joint training has been done away with.
Jointmanships are not only being done at operative level but also at strategic level. This has given birth to the concept of ‘jointness’. ‘JOINTNESS’ is a concept that has emerged in recent years in Indian defence. Jointness has come to be accepted as a basic requirement for any modern military. As joint operations have become an integral part of modern warfare, the need for joint services has also increased. There is no doubt that joint operation is more efficient and effective than separate operations.

The Indian Ocean is a unique marine environment, with its rich biodiversity and the importance of its ecosystems for the well-being of the region’s populations. Its coasts, including those of Western Indian countries, are threatened by climate change and sea level rise. In order to protect these vulnerable areas, a new project has been launched to explore the potential of green infrastructure to reduce flooding and coastline erosion.
Green coast protection is an innovative approach that uses natural systems to provide protection from coast eroding processes and climate-related hazards. The project will involve the development of an evidence base for green protection measures, the implementation of pilot projects and capacity building in the countries concerned.

The Frontier Tribal Areas (FTA) of British India are not well known to historians. This is not surprising, since the FTA was a borderland, a front line of defence, and a military zone. The FTAs were a buffer zone between the British Raj and the Muslim Sultanates in Afghanistan and Central Asia. In the late nineteenth century, the region was threatened by the rise of the Russian Empire and by annexationist tendencies of local rulers. To defend the border, it was decided to create a special administrative zone with a unique system of government. As a result, there were two parallel administrations, one British and one tribally, that co-existed for decades. A peculiarity of this zone was the presence of a large number of military canton",90,192,0.5739644970414202,7.461538461538462,0.8917741329269079,0.04857781450419806,0.8266666666666667,0.8256551724137922,0.7628081146825304,46.77993162864852,50.52662721893491,42.765507518796994

India is a major defence importer, with purchasing requirements running into billions of dollars every year. The US is the largest exporter of defence equipment to India, accounting for more than half of all defence imports in 2006-07. In the wake of the recent scandal involving counter-feits in spare parts for the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, the US Department of Defence has tightened the procurement rules. These changes have implied that the Defense Security Service (DSS) will have to be involved in all purchasers of US defence articles and services. This would mean that even India' s Defences Procurements, which are currently under the Ministry of External Affairs, would have the DSS involved.

The proposed Indian model Bill, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 18th July 30, 65, has been widely criticized for not going far enough in terms of protecting user’s rights and ensuring that they are not deprived of their right to privacy.
In this article, we will analyse the provisions of the Bill and argue that the Indian government has failed to protect the privacies of its citizens. The Bill is likely to be passed in its current form, and the government is unlikely to make any significant changes to the proposed legislation. This article will argue for the need to improve the current legislative framework in order to ensure that user privacies are protected. We will also argue against the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, as this could lead to a violation of user rights.

Coastal Erosion is one of the most important environmental problems faced by India. This is due to the high population density, industrialization and urbanization along the coast. The Southwest Coast of India is most vulnerable to eroding. A detailed study has been made on the eroded coasts in Southwestern India, which includes the states of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Coastal defence structures are being constructed to protect the shoreline from erodible forces. In this study, the effectiveness of these structures has also been studied.

He has served as India’s High Commissioner to Malaysia, High commissioner/Ambassador to Sri Lanka and has been India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. The views expressed in this paper are the author' prevention is better than cure. This is also the basic principle of preventative diplomatic efforts. However, preventing conflict is not always possible. In that case, the only alternative is to be prepared to deal with it.
In the context of India, a major focus of this effort has to come from the political leadership. It is the Prime Minister who has the overall responsibility for the conduct of foreign policy.

Privacy is a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution. Right to privacy has been held to be an intrinsic part of the right of life and personal liberty. It has also been recognized as a part and parcel of right against self-incrimination. The right is implicit in the freedoms of speech, expression, assembly and movement.
The right not to have one’s privateness interfered with is recognized in many other countries. In the United States of America, the Supreme Court has held that the Fourth Amendment of U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable searches and seizures.

India and Russia have a long history of defence and military cooperation, but there are signs that the relationship is under strain.
In recent months, Russia has raised the price of its weapons, making them unaffordable for India. India is also concerned about the quality of Russian weapons and the lack of transparency in the procurement process. In addition, India has been looking to diversify its defence suppliers and has signed contracts with other countries, including the United States. Russia is the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for more than 70% of the country’s defence budget. However, the recent developments have put the future of this relationship in doubt. It is time for both countries to sit down and discuss the way forward. If they can find common ground, there is no reason why the defence relationship between India and Russian should not continue to be strong.",107,188,0.5359116022099447,7.209953218597514,0.8800064616732979,0.05314907961761336,0.9028571428571429,0.8963057324840764,0.7725329744352385,65.35354671143278,62.41436464088398,54.735767729342875

The Australian defence market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.7 per between 01/07/2022 and 70/12/30.

Since then, both countries have collaborated on several projects, including the development of the Javelin anti–tank missile.

Offsets are defined as the obligation on foreign vendors to invest a portion of the contract value in various activities in Indian industry. This includes purchases from Indian venders, research and development, technology transfers and investments. These off-set obligations are typically 30-50% of contract values. Offsets can be in cash or in kind. There are no restrictions on the choice of off set activities, except that they should be related to the defence industry or defence research.

South Asia is a region of high strategic importance to the United States, and the security of this region is of great concern to both the US and Indian governments. The development of India’s missiles, including its nuclear-capable ballistic missilities, has implicated the nuclear strategies of both India and Pakistan. This paper examines the evolution of Indian missilery and its implication for the strategists in both countries. It argues that the development and deployment of the Prithvi and Agni missils have made India a nuclear power and a de facto nuclear weapons state. These missels have also made the Indian nuclear strategy more robust, thereby reducing the probability of a crisis or conflict.

Defence is one of the most important functions of government. The defence of a country is a very serious and responsible task. It is the first responsibility of any government to protect its people from any external aggression. Defence of our country has been the primary responsibility and function of armed forces for centuries.
The security of India has always been of paramount importance to its political leadership. In the last few decades, the security environment in our region has undergone significant changes. India is surrounded by hostile neighbours and a host of non-state actors. China and Pakistan are the two main adversaries of Indian security. Both these countries are engaged in an arms race to enhance their military capabilities. Pakistan has made significant progress in developing nuclear weapons. This has resulted in a strategic imbalance in the region.

The Indian defence sector is growing at a steady pace, and it is one of the most important sectors in the country. The defence budget of India is around 2.5 lakh crore rupees, which is about 1.7% of its GDP. This is a significant increase from the previous year’s budget, when it was around Rs 3 lacs.
In order to promote the growth of this sector, the government has introduced several regulations. These regulate the manufacturing and export of defence equipment, as well as the use of technology and research. In addition, there are several reforms in place that are aimed at making the sector more efficient and effective. Here are some of these reactions and their impact on the industry:

Why Japan Needs India As A Defence Partner
In the last few years, Japan and India have become closer than ever before. Japan has been an important partner for India for a long time, but now it is becoming a strategic partner.
Japan is a key partner in the Indo-Pacific region, and it has a lot of influence over the region. India is also an emerging power in Asia, so it makes sense for Japan to partner with India. The two countries have been working together on various projects, such as the Mumbai-Delhi high-speed rail line and the Tokyo-New Delhi airport. They are also working on a joint military exercise called the Malabar naval exercise. This exercise is important because it will help the two nations to improve their cooperation and coordination in case of a crisis. It will also help",146,182,0.5290697674418605,6.938684950133513,0.8763213883639347,0.05532410549601928,0.86,0.8775675675675674,0.7921664261825461,52.41623785020012,60.94767441860465,57.10649025703238

The British Empire in the twentieth century is often seen as a series of setbacks, retreats and humiliations. This book argues that the British were in fact able to hold on to their empire by exploiting the very weaknesses that were attributed to them by their critics. It examines the case of the Transcaspian frontier in Central Asia, where the collapse of Russian authority in 2015 created a power vacuum.
This book examined the response of Britain and India to the Russian collapse and arguing that Britain was able in effect to re-establish a frontiers in a part of Central Asian that had been out of its control for nearly a century.

The Defence Production Policy 2011 has been drafted in a way that makes it easy for the Indian private industry to enter the defence sector.
Air Vice Marshal (Retd) V R Chaudhary
India's defence requirements are growing and the need for a strong defence industrial base is becoming increasingly imperative. In this context, the Defense Production Act 1980 and its subsequent amendments have been in force for several years. The policy has remained unchanged over the years and has not kept pace with the rapidly changing global scenario. Therefore, a review of this policy is overdue. As a first step, it is necessary to define the scope of policy and clearly identify the objectives. Defining the policy scope and objecting the objective is the first and most important step in the process of making policy. However, this is not a static process.",149,188,0.5406976744186046,7.091183520466117,0.8805447997215052,0.053434882675610584,0.8533333333333334,0.8575675675675682,0.7734350621940576,51.33612273361227,57.66860465116279,56.7672469374597

The quality of defence R&D output is a matter of concern and a major area of interest for the defence establishment. This paper presents a study of quality systems in defence research and development organisational units and their performance. The study is based on the data collected from a sample of 16 units of the DRDO. It was found that the units have been using quality assurance (QA) systems for a long time but their systems are not fully implemented. A majority of them are following the ISO 9001:205 standard. There is an overall improvement in the performance of these units in terms of their QA systems. However, the study reveals that there is still scope for further improvement.

In Defense of Fragmentation
Writing about the Hindus and Muslims in contemporary India is a difficult task. There are many reasons for this. One of them is the nature of our society. It is not a homogenous society, as is often assumed. In fact, it is one of great diversity. We are a country of many faiths, languages, cultures, and traditions. This is what makes us a vibrant and alive society but also makes it difficult to speak of us in the singular. Our society is divided not only along religious lines",153,193,0.5246913580246914,6.678230711206282,0.8732318689917037,0.057373735943829864,0.8266666666666667,0.8130434782608703,0.7536863728617256,42.96996577057939,44.77160493827161,39.77207817846802

India’s ballistic missiles are an important part of its national security apparatus. The country has a number of missions in its military doctrine, which include the deterrence of a nuclear attack by its adversaries, the destruction of enemy strategic and tactical assets, and the projection of power. To achieve these missons, India has an array of ballistics missles, including short-range, medium-ranged, intermediate- and intercontinental- range ballastic missle systems.
However, while India’ s ballistc missels have been deployed, they are not fully operational. For example, its Prithvi-II (P-2) short range surface-to-surface misslie (SRBM), which has been in service since 1995, is yet to be fully integrated into the Indian military. This is because it is still undergoing flight tests and its production line is not yet fully functional",154,199,0.5789473684210527,7.570719217728538,0.8937029425667388,0.047602885172331806,0.8533333333333334,0.839183673469388,0.8039083172796793,62.56967213114755,59.590643274853804,50.03134218289085
Indian defense,the defence of india: a budgetary perspective of strategy and politics,"the defence of india: a budgetary perspective of strategy and politics
Paper presented at the Indian Society of International Law conference on 19th September 2015
Defence expenditure in India has been a subject of considerable debate. It is a highly sensitive subject and is often viewed as a source of wasteful expense. The subject has attracted much attention in recent years, particularly in the aftermath of the 4th Finance Commission report on defence expenses. This paper attempts to examine the budgeting process of defence, its impact on the economy and the political and strategic imperatives that have influenced the process.
It is important to note that defence budget is an important component of government expediture and a large part of it is devoted to capital expensiture. In addition to the capital outlays, the current expendiure incurred in defence is also quite large.

The paper presents the building of a semantic annotation cor-pus which is a collection of annota-tions of Indian defence articles. The corpuses are used for the purpose of text classi-fication. Annotation is performed by using the concept of ontology and domain knowledge. Ontology is used to annotate the text articles, and the domain expertise is applied to assign the tags.

China has been steadily developing its nuclear capabilities and has also been developing and testing a number of ballistics missiles. It is, therefore, a matter of concern that India is not prepared to deal with such a situation. The development of a ballastic missle defence (BMD) system by India will be the first step in this direction.

Ballistic-missile-defence (BMD) is a strategically important component of the Indo-US strategi
c partnership. The US has been eager to sell BMD technology to India. This paper examines the
IndoChinese strategies, their implications for BM D and the prospects for India’s acquisition of B
M technology from the US. It argues that India is unlikely to acquire B M technology in its present
form. However, India could acqui re B MD technology for a limited purpose. India and China are
likely to develop their own BD systems, but they will not be interoperable. Their B D systems will
have different missions and will be designed to protect different assets. They will also have different",170,195,0.5497076023391813,7.188359661277602,0.8836235067391955,0.0521167469657467,0.8533333333333334,0.8634013605442177,0.7965008247264218,54.216796875,52.52046783625731,54.28667376317924

The Middle East has been a major source of strategic and commercial interest for Britain for over 200 years. In the 50-year period covered by this book, Britain's relationship with the Ottoman Empire was the dominant influence on her foreign policy.
From the French Revolution to the Napoleonic Wars, and from the Congress of Vienna to Trafalgar, the Middle Eastern territories were the theatre for a series of conflicts which determined Britain’s place in world politics. This book describes the development of British interests in Syria, Egypt, Persia, Arabia and Turkey, as well as the early stages of the East India Company’ and the British Navy’’ s involvement in these regions. It also examines the key role played by the Arabian Peninsula, where Britain fought a long and bloody war against the Persian Empire.

India’s Partition and Defence of Pakistan: An Historical Perspective
The Partitions of India and Pakistan are among the most traumatic events in the subcontinent’ s history. They were the result of the British Government’’ decision to grant independence to India on 15th August 47. The decision was taken after a series of events that began with the arrival of Lord Mountbatten in India in March 2046. These events, which were to change the destiny of millions of people, were neither inevitable nor unavoidable. On the contrary, they were a result, among other things, of a flawed British policy of ‘’divide and rule’. This policy had been followed for more than a century and had led to a situation where the Muslims were alienated and marginalized in a predominantly Hindu India.

India’s defence ties with Israel have received a boost with the recent visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to India. This is the first time that an Israelli Prime Minster has visited India in the last 15 years. The visit is significant for several reasons. First, it is indicative of the deepening of bilateral tensions between India and Pakistan. Second, the visit comes at a time when India is engaged in a major arms race with China, which is a long-time ally of Pakistan and is increasingly becoming a rival.
The visit also coincides with a period of relative calm in India-Pakistan relations.

In this article, we will discuss the current scenario of Indian Defense Industries and the future prospects of this sector.
Current Scene:
According to a report by the Ministry of Defene, the defence budget of India has increased by 12.2% in 3 years, from ₹2,46,726 crore in FY 06-07 to 4,68,229 cr in fiscal year 9-10.

The European Union is India's second largest trading partner. The European Defence Agency (EDA) was set up in 2004 to contribute to the European security and defence policy. In 1998, the EU and India signed a Cooperation Agreement, which is the basis for bilateral relations.
In the field of defence, India is an important partner for the EDA. Both sides have expressed a common desire to develop their co-operation. But there are still many obstacles to be overcome. On the one hand, there is a lack of clarity about the scope of the cooperative activities and, on the other, about their financing. Moreover, neither the Indian nor the Union Defense Ministers have the political power to make decisions. To overcome these obstacle, both sides must find a new political impetus.",191,187,0.5696969696969697,7.317890075118315,0.8898047982481192,0.04969379915440369,0.8666666666666667,0.8451063829787235,0.7765345590462858,59.27713817871823,57.83030303030303,47.90361868045211

The Indian Defence sector is undergoing a major transformation. The new policy initiatives of the Government of India have resulted in an increased emphasis on indigenisation, a higher degree of self-reliance and the development of a robust domestic defence industry.
India is on the cusp of its next big defence acquisition programmes. As per the Ministry of Defense, India is looking at a potential acquisitions budget of USD 150 billion over the next decade, which will be the biggest in the world. This will provide an opportunity for Indian companies to partner with the global majors in order to develop the technologies required for the Indian defence requirements. A key focus area for this partnership will need to be in areas of technology transfer, manufacturing capabilities and joint ventures.

Professor Srinath Raghavan
Defence analysts in India and abroad are united in their assessment that India’s defence expenditure is inadequate to meet its security requirements. The reasons for this include the fact that defence spending has been declining as a proportion of the GDP, the inability of successive governments to build a consensus on the nature of India's security challenges, and the failure to make defence procurement more efficient. This talk will examine these issues, arguing that the current problems are rooted in the country' s past. It will be argued that a key reason why India has not been able to achieve a more robust defence posture is that it has pursued a strategy of ‘strategic autonomy’, which has had the effect of reducing the level of",196,200,0.5859872611464968,7.3423993371021234,0.8942976174667105,0.048136253593062873,0.8733333333333334,0.8649624060150377,0.7940472884121491,48.653721293537586,60.853503184713375,61.81007339644719

In 2007, India and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) signed a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which was a major step in deepening relations between India, Asean and other Asiatic countries.
The two countries have been working together on a number of issues, including security, trade, and investment. The two sides have also been cooperating on projects such as the India-Vietnam oil pipeline and the Delhi-Hanoi railway line. Recently, the two nations have signed an agreement on defence cooperation. This agreement is expected to boost defence ties between the countries and will help India to further strengthen its presence in the Asia-Pacific region.

India's defence education system has been in a state of flux since independence. In the first years after independence, the Indian military was not adequately staffed, and the British officers who had been trained at Sandhurst and at the Royal Military College in India were needed to fill the ranks of the army. But by the 1960s, India was producing more than enough officers to staff its armed forces, yet the system of education that produced them was inefficient, ineffective, unimaginative, lacking in innovation, unable to attract the best and brightest, out of touch with the needs of a modern military, unaware of developments in military education around the world,...

The British reorganised their Higher Defence Organisation (HDO) in 2004. In 1998, the HDO was made up of the Ministry of Defense (MoD), the Joint Staff Committee (JSC) and the Chiefs of Staff (COS). The JSC was the most important of these three, as it was responsible for the strategic direction of defense. The COS were responsible to the MoD for operational matters.
In 30 years, there had been a significant change in the global strategies of defence. This led to a shift in priorities for HQ MoS, and in particular, to their role as the center for strategizing. It was decided that the C-in-Cs, who were the only representatives of all three services, should be the chiefs and not the staff.

“India is a country with a population of 1.3 billion and the world’s fastest growing economy. It is also the sixth largest economy in the G20. With such a large population and economic growth, the Indian economy is expected to generate a huge amount of tax revenue in coming years.
The Indian government is the largest employer in India and employs around 30 million people. The Indian Armed Forces is one of the biggest employers in Indian defence sector. According to a report by the World Bank, India has one the lowest military expenditures in Asia.

Indian Defence Equipment Manufacturing: An MSME Perspective
The Indian defence industry has been growing at a fast pace and is expected to reach $100 billion by 2025. The MSM sector is a major contributor to this growth, accounting for over 50% of the total defence production.
In order to promote the growth of MSMS in the defence sector, the government has taken several initiatives, such as the ""Make in India"" campaign, which aims to encourage foreign companies to manufacture their products in Indian MSSEs. Another initiative is the Defense Corridors, where MSSMs can set up their manufacturers and benefit from tax breaks and other incentives. These initiates have helped to increase the number of defence MSMDs in MSMMs, and the sector continues to grow.",212,191,0.6266666666666667,7.675067860720625,0.9067302877986564,0.042861121661698205,0.86,0.890476190476189,0.8118094055495101,71.48328412989707,69.66,58.12422037422037

J. S. Dewan
This book examines the role of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in the civil–mil­it­ary relationship in India. The author argues that the MoD is a weak min­istry and that its role in civil­milita­ry relations is not well defined. This has led to a lack of accountability and control over the defence forces, which have been allowed to become autonomous and powerful.
The author traces the development of civil military relations over a period of 60 years, beginning with the first defence secretary, Lt Gen P. C. Lal, in 1954, and concluding with a brief discussion of current issues. He describes how the structure of Mo­D has remained unchanged since 2001 and how it has failed to meet the needs of a modern defence minis­try.

The present study was aimed at evaluating the performance of three rice (Oryza sativa L.) landrace varieties of Jeypur tract in Odishan India in terms of leaf gas exchange, antagonistic and pro-oxidative enzymes, and the relationship between these trails in the context of multiple stresses. The results revealed that the three land races showed high tolerances to both drought and salinity stress. However, the tolerant land race showed higher antiprotease activity and lower prooxydative activity than the sensitive land race. Moreover, tolerants showed significantly higher chlorophyll content, higher photosystem II activity, lower non-structural carbohydrate and starch content and higher leaf water potential than sensitive. These results suggest that tolerable land raced showed better leaf functioning in photosythetic and stress-",220,183,0.575,7.273238618387272,0.8909623082220898,0.04946994384875627,0.8666666666666666,0.856176470588236,0.802111475980132,55.77780775110152,67.44375,51.109613375130614

It is currently the third largest arms supplier in South Asia and the seventh largest in world, with a 3.4% share of global arms exports.
The defence industry in India has grown over the years, as the country is seeking to reduce its dependence on imports. Indian defence companies are now able to meet the majority of domestic requirements for defence products. However, the industry is still heavily reliant on imported technology, which is a major concern for the Indian government.

The political dynamics of India' s Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) programme have been subjected to intense speculation and debate in the past few years. The programme, which has been in existence since the early 1980s, was officially announced in January 2003. Since then, there has emerged a plethora of reports in both the Indian and international media on the programme. There are also a number of studies and articles on BMD published in academic journals. Most of these studies are either purely technical in nature or focus on one aspect of the BDM programme without providing a comprehensive picture of its political and strategic implication. This study, therefore, attempts to fill this gap in knowledge by examining the political factors that have influenced the development of BM D in India. In particular, the study will examine the following issues: (1) The role of national security",224,197,0.5911602209944752,7.95324736484468,0.8988807354044175,0.044789043808612865,0.88,0.8777070063694264,0.8006811926610441,67.99497710879089,64.93922651933701,54.247150997150996

The defence budget of India has always been a subject of debate. The question is whether it is sufficient to meet the requirements of the armed forces. It has been argued that the defence allocation is inadequate to maintain the operational efficiency of our defence forces, to modernise our weapon systems and to provide for the welfare of defence personnel. This article attempts to examine the trends in the allocation for defence during the post-independence period.

India’s new nuclear doctrine: Implications for Pakistan
The new Indian nuclear posture has been described as a ‘strategic triad’, which includes nuclear-armed submarines, land-based missiles and air-launched missile.
By Nadeem F. Paracha
Amidst the political furore over the Indian government’ s decision to withdraw the country’’ status as the world’ second largest arms importer, New Delhi has quietly launched its new ‘’Nuclear Doctrine’. The new doctrine has also been accompanied by a new set of nuclear delivery vehicles, including a nuclear submarine and a long-range nuclear missle. It is being argued that the new policy is a major departure from India’ previous nuclear policy, where the focus was on a minimum deterrent. Some have even gone as far as to call it a “first strike doctrine”.

Indian Defence and Security Industry
The Indian defence industry is a dynamic and rapidly growing sector that is playing an increasingly important role in the country’s economy and national security. The industry has been growing at a steady pace over the past few years, and is expected to continue to do so in future.
One of the key drivers of growth in this sector is the increasing demand for defence equipment from the Indian Armed Forces. With India’ s growing population and increasing security concerns, the need for modern and sophisticated defence systems has become a priority for the government. This has led to an increase in investment in research and development, as well as in procurement of defence goods and services. According to the Ministry of Defense, India spent over $55 billion on defence in 2019, which is more than double what it spent in just 10 years. Moreover, this figure is projected to increase to over",231,197,0.5454545454545454,7.458978726096732,0.884128614416961,0.05100328528611154,0.8571428571428571,0.8804907975460114,0.7878873984722461,62.333333333333336,64.92513368983957,64.17880464858882

India’s Defence Policy: The Challenges and Opportunities
The Indian armed forces are undergoing a major transformation. India’a defence expenditure has increased significantly in recent years. The country’ s defence budget has doubled over the past five years and is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace.
This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including India s increasingly assertive foreign policy, the country s growing economic power, and the growing threat from Pakistan and China. These factors are putting a strain on the Indian military, which is struggling to keep up with the demands of the government and its allies. As a result, India is facing a series of challenges that are threatening its ability to defend itself and maintain its position as a regional power. This paper will examine these challeng es and offer some possible solutions.",235,194,0.5952380952380952,7.715167498104595,0.8987514753225125,0.045498630464059824,0.8333333333333334,0.8741666666666669,0.8013906735453092,66.74471920540438,68.75,60.30715596330275

The First World War, and the subsequent interwar years, were a period of intense debate over the future of the British Empire. In the years following the end of hostilities, the colonial governments of India and Australia began to agitate for greater autonomy and self-government. This book analyses the strategic and political implications of these debates for the defence of Britain and India. The book examines the political and strategical thinking of key figures in the post-war period, such as the Secretary of State for India, Sir Edwin Montagu, Lord Chelmsford, General Sir William Mitchell, Winston Churchill and Lord Halifax. It shows how the imperial debate had a profound impact on the formulation of British defence policy, particularly in relation to the Indian Army.

The Indian High court has recently passed an order that has opened the doors for the use of the “own name” defence as a ground of invalidity in the tradepark oppositions proceeding.
In a case, where the plaintiff sought a permanent injunction against the defendant from using the mark “BOMBAY SPICE” in relation to spices and food products, the High-Court of Bombay, while allowing the defendants application to file a counterclaim, held that the ‘own-use’ defence may be raised as an objection to registration of a trade mark.

India’s defence ministry has launched a major overhaul of the country’ s defence acquisition system, with the aim of improving the way in which it purchases military hardware. The over-hauling of India’’ defence purchasing system comes at a time when the government is under pressure to reduce the costs of defence equipment and to speed up the delivery of orders.
In a move that has surprised many, the defence minister has announced that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) will no longer be the sole buyer of military equipment. Instead, it will act as the regulator of a new system that will see the Indian armed forces themselves take charge of purchas-ing military gear. Under the new proc-ess, each of three service chiefs will be responsible for the purchase of equipment for their respective services.

By: Lt Col. Gaurav Dua
Offsets are a mechanism to ensure that the benefits of defence acquisition are shared with the host country. In the Indian context, the Defense Offsets Policy was announced in 2005 and is aimed at achieving a fair and balanced distribution of the economic benefits derived from defence procurements.
The Definitive Approach
As per the policy, foreign vendors are required to invest a certain percentage of their total contract value in India, in projects that are related to the defence sector. The investments are to be made within a defined period of time, which varies from contract to contract. These projects are known as ‘offsets’. As per current policy guidelines, offsets can be in the form of:
Transfer of technology and/or know-how
Investments in research and development

The recent deployment of the Indian Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) system has raised serious concerns about its impact on the regional strategies of India and Pakistan. This paper examines the implication of BMD for the strategical stability of South Asia. It is argued that BDM has the potential to destabilize the nuclear deterrence of Pakistan, and to lead to a nuclear arms race in South Asian region. The paper also suggests that the BMG will not be able to dampen the Pakistani nuclear capability. However, it will strengthen India's conventional military capabilites.

Japan is currently considering the deployment of a ballistics missiles defence (BMD) system, which has been a contentious issue in its relations with China. Japan’s BMD system is intended to protect against a limited ballistically missle attack from North Korea, but it is also likely to be seen as a threat by China, with whom Japan has a territorial dispute in the East China Sea. India is a close ally of Japan and has also been considering BDM. However, India’ s BM D programme is primarily designed to provide a shield against Pakistan, and China is not seen to pose a serious threat. This paper looks at the prospects for co-operation between India and Japan on B M D.

The Indian Rupees exchange rates have been volatile in recent times. The Indian ruppe has fallen to a record low of 69.19 to the dollar. This has been attributed to weak domestic economic fundamentals, such as high inflation, low growth, and high interest rates. In this blog post, we will explore the factors that have led to this volatility and how the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has responded to it.
India’s economy is heavily reliant on exports, with the country’ss top export destinations being the United States, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and the UAE. As a result of this, Indian exporters have experienced significant losses in the past few years due to currency fluctuations.

Indian Defense and United Nations Peace Keeping Operations: Are the Two Compatible?  United Nation’s (UN) peace keeping operations have been a major success story of the organization. 245,00 military and civilian personnel are deployed to 75 peace-keepings operations. These operations are often called ‘the UN’ s best idea’. The UN peace operations in the past have seen some successes, but also failures. A recent report by the UN highlighted that in some cases, peace keepers have contributed to the conflict and in others, they have failed to protect the civilians.

India’s Higher Defence Organisation: Implications For National Security And Jointness - 2019
The Government of India is in the process of creating a High-Level Defense Council (HDC) to advise the Prime Minister on defence and national-security related issues. The HDC is intended to be a single-point decision-making authority on all defense-related matters. This is a significant step toward India’ s goal of achieving joint-ness in national defense, which is widely considered to enhance the effectiveness of defense policy and operations. However, the establishment of the HLC could also have the unintended effect of undermining joint operations and even the concept of joint defence.
In this report, we examine the implication of this development for the future of Indian defence policy, and for India-U.S. defence cooperation. We recommend that",277,186,0.543859649122807,7.111887749987415,0.8815433844209584,0.05304828567669944,0.8533333333333334,0.8495238095238099,0.784277804612509,57.0,52.11695906432749,51.715891572456314

In the first of this two-part series, we examine the challenges to India’s defence sector and how the Modi government is tackling them.
India is not a country with a history of strategic thinking. Its leaders, from Jawaharlal Nehru to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, have always been more comfortable with the idea of non-alignment than with that of alliances. India has been a reluctant buyer of weapons, preferring to develop its own arms industry and relying on the Soviet Union and later Russia to supply it. But the country has also been an indifferent provider of military hardware to other countries. And it has failed to build a coherent strategically oriented defence industrial base. Instead, India is a nation of arms importers and arms exporters, with neither the industry",279,183,0.5921052631578947,7.299963950884314,0.8956840537227323,0.047810918644049086,0.8866666666666667,0.8978124999999997,0.7936634669168666,64.3718378543127,66.15131578947368,65.40323464912281

The defence ministry has issued a draft notification on the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy in the defence manufacturing sector. The notification has sought comments from the public and stakeholders. It is expected that the FDI policy will be finalised by the end of this year.
India has one of the largest defence forces in terms of manpower. However, it is not equipped with modern weapons and equipment. This has led to a shortfall in defence expenditure, which has been a cause of concern for the government. In order to address this issue, the Indian government has decided to allow foreign direct investment in India's defence industry.

The 1987-88 Indian nuclear tests and the subsequent imposition of sanctions by the United States and other major Western countries in 2008-09 have severely constrained India’s access to advanced weapon systems and defence-related technologies. The Indian military’’ response to the sanctioned environment has been to diversify its defence suppliers. India has long been a major arms importer and, in recent years, has turned to Israel to meet its military requirements.
In 50 years of diplomatic relations, India and Israel have built a strong relationship, but the defence relationship has only begun to develop over the past decade. In 30-plus years as an independent nation, Israel has become a leading arms exporter, with a 70 per cent share of its $5.7 billion defence export market going to Asia.

Innovation in the defence and security sector is a key priority for the European Union. The European Defence Action Plan (2013) highlights the importance of innovative technologies and the need for a better cooperation between Member States in this field. However, the EU is not the only region in which defence innovations are considered a priority. China and India are two emerging powers that have been identified as potential competitors for Europe in many areas, including defence.

The Indian government’ s decision to increase the defence allocation for 2010-11 to Rs 1,42,500 crore (USD 32.5 billion) is a welcome step. It is also an acknowledgement of the fact that the country’ S security is being threatened by a variety of factors, including the ongoing internal insurgency in the Northeast, the threat from Pakistan and China, and the growing incidence of terrorism. The decision has also come in for criticism from several quarters for its inadequacy.

It also introduced the “Make II” procedure, aimed at increasing the indigeneity of indiand products. In 1998, India launched a programme to develop indigeous military equipment. This programme was aiming to build a strong indiginous defence industrial base and reduce dependence on foreign suppliers. To achieve this, indien defence industries were encouraged to establish joint ventures with foreign companies.

In fact, it has reiterated that its nuclear weapons programme will remain as an ""insurance policy"" against any eventuality. The government also made clear its position that India will continue to remain a non-nuclear weapons state. However, in the changed global context, India has decided to go ahead with the nuclear agreement with US. While the US has made its commitment to India, there are some who question the wisdom of this decision. They are of the opinion that this deal is not in India' s interest.

The need for a missle defence system for India was first felt in the 1980s, when Pakistan began developing a nuclear deterrent. The development of nuclear weapons by Pakistan was a serious setback to India’ s nuclear strategy, which was based on a ‘credible minimum dterrent’. With the advent of the nuclear age, India had to review its strategic doctrine and re-assess its defence and dtefence posture.
In 2002, the Government of India announced a decision to develop an indigenous missie defence capability, based upon the Israeli Arrow system. This was followed by the development and deployment of a system called the Prithvi Air Defense (PAD) system, designed to",315,192,0.5870967741935483,7.30929589301274,0.8944039818067703,0.04821005799324369,0.88,0.8839694656488545,0.8057412127772324,62.10799310983135,66.0516129032258,57.61578947368421

The Indian Government has been pursuing the development of a Ballistice Missle Defense (BMD) capability since 2002. The BMD program is aimed at providing a shield to India's major cities against ballistically-armed missiles. In its current form, the BMS is a layered system, which includes the Phased Array Radar (PAR) and the Advanced Air Defensse (AAD) interceptor. This paper analyses the current state of India’s BDM program and its future prospects, and also discusses threaths that India may face in the future.

In 1998, India became the only country to have conducted a nuclear test. Since then, the country has been under a lot of international pressure to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). In the past, there have been many attempts to persuade India to join the treaty, but to no avail.
India has always been reluctant to do so, and for good reason. The CTBT is a flawed treat. It does not provide for the verification of nuclear tests. This means that India would be able to conduct nuclear weapons tests without any international oversight. Additionally, it does nothing to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. India is not the first country that has refused to ratify the CBTT. In fact, many other countries have also refused, including China, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan",323,193,0.5314285714285715,7.030139197971627,0.877596770909365,0.05457028656394139,0.8628571428571429,0.8585430463576156,0.7605170316968737,51.90198132684189,53.05714285714286,49.358003924866836

Indian Defence Expenditures in Global Perspective
In the last two decades, India’s defence budget has grown at a rate of 10 percent per annum. This is a remarkable achievement in a country where defence spending is perceived as a drain on the economy. India is the world’ s fourth largest military spender, with a defence outlay of US$ 55.6 billion in 2018-19. The country’S defence allocation is expected to grow to USD 62.5 billion by 3032-33, and US $ 80 billion to 700 by the year 02524.

India has been a free and independent nation for more than 50 years. In this time, it has developed a formidable defence capability. This has enabled the country to play an active role in international affairs, including peacekeeping and disaster relief operations. India has also been an important partner in global economic growth. But the rapid changes in technology, the globalisation of the economy and the emergence of new security threats have created new challenges for India.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between defence expenditure and real GDP growth in Pakistan and India, using the co-integration and error correction methods. The study has found that defence budget has a negative effect on real growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in both countries. For Pakistan, the defence-Gross National Products (GNP) ratio is 2.5 percent while for India it is less than 1 percent. However, in the short run, defence has no significant effect in India but it has significant negative impact in case of Pakistan.

The United States and India have agreed to cooperate on missiles and missle defence, but this may run afoul of the Missile Technology Control Regime.
Missile Defense Agency, 2006
India is the most important U.S. partner in Asia. The two countries have a long history of cooperation, and their relationship has been strengthened by the UPA government’s reform agenda. In 1998, India conducted its first nuclear test, which led to a UNSC resolution condemning the test and calling on India to suspend all nuclear tests. India, however, refused to do so. Instead, it conducted another series of tests in 90s, after which it became a de facto nuclear weapons state. This led the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on New Delhi. However,",337,182,0.5974842767295597,7.533990064322369,0.8983947437013895,0.04615489644103853,0.8866666666666667,0.8835555555555556,0.8086371186740469,68.56032154060648,66.84276729559748,61.64679048550016

India's defence procurement process is a complex and unwieldy bureaucratic mess, with the acquisitions process taking anywhere between 10 to 20 years to complete.
In comparison, the US defence industry is one of the most advanced in the world, and has a robust and efficient acqui-sition system in place. This paper examines the defence-acquisition process in India and the United States, including the bidding, evaluation and awarding process, as well as the role of various institutions in this process. It then exam-ines how the Indian defence sector can learn from the American defence system, to make India'a defence pro-curements system more efficient.",338,182,0.5827338129496403,6.870330330407765,0.8905608205096683,0.05106785985675675,0.8720000000000001,0.8566956521739136,0.7741324914268167,56.84350433211789,59.805755395683455,45.81294030404153

The agreement is expected to be signed during the visit of Vietnamese President Nguyen Minh Triet to India later this year. It will mark a significant step in bilateral defence ties between India and Viet Nam. India is one of the few countries with which Vientam has a DAC.

1. Introduction The defence industry is a key sector for the economic growth of any country. In the context of India, the country’s defence industrial base has been characterised by a combination of imports and indigenous production. While the former has ensured the availability of a wide range of defence equipment to the Armed Forces, it has also led to a high dependence on imports. Moreover, a large part of these imports are from a limited number of countries, which in turn has resulted in a vulnerable supply chain.
The defence policy of 2013 has, therefore, sought to promote indigeneous design, development and manufacturing of equipment by the private sector. The policy also encourages foreign collaboration and technology transfers for defence production, subject to certain conditions. This has led the Government to consider relaxing the existing FDI policy in defence. Recent policy announcements have, however, been met with criticism from",346,194,0.5263157894736842,7.2547625011001164,0.8776727765405299,0.05368163693008349,0.8571428571428571,0.8486746987951812,0.7498783547601952,55.27310017271158,54.01052631578948,51.19647930194805

2 I think the problem with the defense system is that the people in charge of it are not in the military. They are politicians. Politicians are good at a lot of things, but they are definitely not good leaders in battle. It is a well known fact that a good leader in war is someone who can be decisive and make the right decision in a split second. The problem is, the politicans don't have this ability. So, they make decisions based on what they think will get them votes. This is not a recipe for success in military matters. We need to elect people who have military experience.

India and Bangladeshi defence officials have agreed to deepen defence ties, with both sides expressing a desire to expand the scope of co-operation.
The two countries have a long history of defence relations, but the relationship has never been as warm as it is now. This is because of the growing threat of terrorism in Bangla­desh, and the Indian government’s concern over the rise of Islamic extremism. There is also a growing recognition that India and B­ang­l­adesh share a common interest in combating terror.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has been a major player in the defence of the country. It has not only played a vital role in defending the borders but also provided strategic mobility to the Indian Army during operations in Kargil and Operation Parakram.
With the introduction of supersonic fighter aircraft, the IAF has become a formidable force in South Asia. However, it is not just the number of aircraft that is important but the quality of pilots and the availability of spare parts. The IAf has taken several initiatives to improve its operational efficiency.

In a bid to further strengthen the defence ties between India and Malaysia, the two countries signed a defence framework agreement on 26th January 1994.

In a recent interview with The Economic Times, the Defender of the Realm, Mr. Manohar Parrikar, expressed his concern about the inability of India to spend on defense in proportion to its growing economy. The Defensive Minister was quoted as saying, “India is a big country and a fast-growing economy, but we are spending only 2 percent of GDP on defence. We should be speding 3 percent to 4 percent.”
This statement is noteworthy for at least three reasons.

Sir John Simon, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was the most important member of Britain’s war cabinet, and he was responsible for the formulation of its foreign policy. His policy was based on the belief that Britain had to act in concert with France and Russia.
Simon’ s policy had three main aspects: first, it was a policy of support for Russia; second, a commitment to France; and third, an attempt to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Simon believed that the first two of these aspects were necessary for Britain to be able to defend its interests, but the third was necessary to ensure that Europe was not dominated by a single power. He argued that if Britain did not support Russia, France would be forced to take on Germany alone. If Britain supported France, Germany would have to deal with the French alone, which would leave Britain exposed to the possibility of",371,188,0.4846938775510204,6.785714285714286,0.862784760394811,0.059860345150701204,0.8514285714285714,0.8520930232558142,0.7674593030545818,49.0,50.53061224489796,50.36979472140762

In the last few decades, India has emerged as a major global power with a rising economy and a strong technological base. India’s defence industry is now a global player and has made its mark in the international market. The Indian defence research and development (R& D) sector has been one of the most vibrant and innovative sectors in India.
India has a long history of defence R & D and it is one the largest defence exporters in Asia.

The United States and India have recently agreed to elevate their relationship to a “major defence partner” status. The designation is meant to signal to the world that the two countries will have an even closer defence relationship than they have in the past.
As the United State’s largest arms supplier, India has been a key defence and security partner for decades. India is also the second largest buyer of US military equipment in Asia, behind only Japan. And the US is India’ s second-largest arms exporter, after Russia. In 2015, the Obama administration cleared the way for India to purchase US drones, and in 1998 the Clinton administration approved the sale of the C-17 Globemaster III aircraft to India.

India’s defence sector is one of the largest in the world, and it has been growing rapidly in recent years. With a strong focus on research and development, India is now able to produce advanced weapons and systems that are competitive with those of other countries.
The Indian defence market is projected to reach $150 billion by 2025, making it one the most lucrative markets in Asia. India’smilitary expenditure has increased steadily since 1998, reaching $65 billion in 0014. The government has also been investing heavily in new technologies and equipment, which is expected to drive further growth in this sector. In addition, there is a growing demand for defence products from countries around the globe, providing opportunities for Indian companies to export their products and services.

Provocation is a mitigating factor in criminal cases. It can be used as an affirmative defense, or it can serve as the basis for a lesser charge. However, it is important to note that proving provoca-tion is not an easy task. In order to be successful, the defendant must be able to show that the other person was the cause of his or her actions.

However, the Indian government is not keen on acquiring a dedicated AWACs, which is believed to be a very expensive system, especially when the country is looking at alternatives to reduce the budgetary allocation for the defense sector.

China is a nuclear power. It has the third largest nuclear arsenal in terms of the number of warheads in its inventory. Its nuclear forces are believed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons by land, sea and air. However, the Chinese nuclear force is not the most important aspect of China' s nuclear policy. China has been pursuing a policy of nuclear progression. In other words, it has a programme of increasing the nuclear capability of its forces. This policy is reflected in China's nuclear doctrine which is based on the concept of minimum deterrence. The Chinese are concerned about the pro-lifers in Pakistan and Iran.

The Indian defence sector is a key area of focus for the Indian government.
In 2015, the government launched the ‘Make in India’ initiative, aimed at boosting the manufacturing sector and creating jobs. The initiatives are expected to increase the share of defence manufacturers in the global defence market to 50 per cent by 100. India is already the second largest importer of arms and defence equipment in Asia after China. In the last 40 years, India has imported more than $25 billion worth of weapons. With the growing need to improve the country’

The Indian government is considering a major restructuring of its military command and control. The Indian military is currently divided into three commands, each headed by a lieutenant general. It is proposed that the army, navy and air force will be brought under a single integrated command, with the chief of defence staff (CDS) as its head. This would be a historic development in India’s defence organisation, which has remained largely unchanged for decades.
A CDS will have the authority to exercise control over all three services, and will also be responsible for the overall planning and execution of military operations. He will act as the military adviser to the government and be the principal military spokesperson. Currently, the three service chiefs are the primary military interlocutors with political leaders. There are many advantages to having a CDC.

The North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) is one of the most important areas of Pakistan. It is the gateway to the Central Asian republics and a vital link in any future trade with China. In 1914, the British government was concerned about the security of India’s northwestern frontiers. The British Indian Army’ s North West Frontiers Force (the NWFF) was a force of about 20,00 men, commanded by Major-General Sir Charles Monro, which was to be deployed in India to defend the NWF. This force was stationed at Peshawar, a city in northwest Pakistan, on the border with Afghanistan.

The cost of research, development and production of any defence system is a function of its complexity, technical and schedule risks. It is essential to have a cost estimate of the project at the beginning of development to be able to assess the cost and time overruns and to take corrective measures. In this paper, a method for the estimation and analysis of cost risk is presented. The method is based on the concept of probability of occurrence of risk and probability distribution of costs. A model is developed for estimation the probability distributions of project cost, schedule and technical risk.

Greening Indian Defence Forces: A Conceptual Framework Towards Accelerating Carbon Neutrality In India -
The concept of green defence was first introduced in the 1980s. The term was defined as the military’s responsibility to protect the environment and to reduce its own environmental impact. Since then, the concept has evolved to include a wide range of activities, including energy efficiency, water conservation, waste reduction, and pollution prevention.
In recent years, there has been growing interest in green defense among military leaders and policymakers. This is due, in part, to the increasing awareness of the importance of environmental sustainability and the need to address climate change. Green defense is also seen as a way to enhance military readiness and resilience by reducing the risks posed by climate-related disasters",409,181,0.5962732919254659,7.565859899895366,0.898245418711485,0.046109021284217726,0.8533333333333334,0.8543065693430664,0.80604234359456,64.41020837536388,68.42857142857143,61.5622863004331

The Indian defence budget has been in a state of flux since the mid-1990s. The Indian armed forces have been underfunded for decades, but the situation became more critical during the 15-year tenure of former Prime Minister Vajpayee.
Vajapayee’s tenures (10 years in power) saw defence spending rise from 2.7% of GDP to 3.2% in 5 years. However, this was not enough to meet the demands of a growing military and a large number of ageing equipment. Since 9/11, the Indian military has had to deal with an increased threat from Pakistan and China, which has resulted in increased expenditure on the military.

What should the Indian defence industry do to become a successful exporters?
India is a country with a large population, a strong economy, and a growing defence sector. In recent years, India has been increasingly looking to export its defence products and services. This is due to a number of factors, including the increasing demand for defence equipment from countries around the world, as well as the growing need for India to generate revenue from its exports.
There are a few things that the defence manufacturers in India can do in order to make their products more export-friendly. Firstly, they should focus on developing products that are tailored to the needs of the export market. Secondly
1. India should continue to invest in its domestic defence capabilities. 2. The government should provide incentives for Indian companies to produce defence exports, such as tax breaks and subsidies.3.",424,187,0.5136612021857924,6.948679946972985,0.8721195620784874,0.05652296241981945,0.84,0.866666666666666,0.7610245859660614,51.93770777925532,53.387978142076506,53.38529493215176

It is made up of different arms of services and agencies. These agency and departments are under the control of civilian bureaucracy and politicians. They are not accountable to the people.

India is a country with an economy that is on the rise and a growing middle class. It is also a nuclear power with a large military. As it becomes increasingly important for India to maintain its security and stability, it is essential that it has a strong military-industrial complex. This complex will provide the necessary infrastructure and resources to support the military, as well as the economy.
The economic imperative for developing a robust military is clear: a well-equipped military can help ensure that India remains secure in the face of threats from both within and outside its borders. The defence industry in India is currently worth about $25 billion, and is expected to grow to $50 billion by 2022. A strong and efficient military will also help India maintain stability in its region, which is important given that the country has border disputes with both China and Pakistan.

The Defence Procurements Procedure (DPP) of 2005 has been a major step forward in terms of opening up the defence sector to foreign vendors. However, the DPP has not been able to fulfil its objectives because of a number of procedural and institutional bottlenecks.
In the wake of the 1962 war with China, defence preparedness in India took a backseat and was given low priority. In the post-1231 war years, India was more focused on the political and economic fronts and defence was relegated to the back burner. This resulted in a significant decline in the country's defence capabilities and a corresponding increase in defence imports. The defence budget remained stagnant at around 3% of GDP and the acquisition process was inefficient and protracted.

the current Chinese defence reform and its impacts on India
The current reformation of the Chinese military is an attempt to address the shortcomings of its existing military structure, which is based on the Soviet model of military organization. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone a number of changes over the years, including the introduction of a new command structure and the expansion of joint operations.
One of China’ s most important military reorganizations is the creation of seven military regions. This change has made it easier for the PLA to respond to threats and has also improved the coordination between different branches of service.

The defence under Section 84 of the Indian Penal Code is available only to the accused persons who are suffering from a mental disease. The defence is not available to a person who has a defect of reason, but is capable of knowing what he is doing.
Insanity is a state of mind where the person is unable to understand the nature and consequences of his acts. In other words, the law does not recognize a man’s right to kill another person because he happens to be insane. It is the duty of a court to protect society from such persons. Hence, insa nity as a defence has been rejected by the courts. However, in the case of R. v. Dudley and Stephens (1883) 11 QBD 273, it was held that if a defendant is suffering form a severe mental disorder, he may be acquitted.

Indian defense,private defence under indian criminal law,"private defence under indian criminal law

This article discusses the issue of private self-defence under Indian criminal laws.
Private self defence is a complete defence to a criminal charge if it is proved that the accused has acted in self defense. It is not necessary that there should be a reasonable apprehension of danger to the life or physical safety of the person. Even if the appellant had not reason to believe that his life was in danger, he can still claim private defense if he had acted to protect his property. The right of self protection is inherent in the right to life. In the absence of any statutory provision, the common law position is that a person can use force to defend himself and his family, his body and property from assault, and to prevent crime. 
The right is limited by the principle that it must be used in proportion to, or not exceeding, that which is necessary to repel the assault. This is known as the ""proport",450,197,0.4603174603174603,6.328318816843779,0.8519884889186642,0.0650182273254042,0.7999999999999999,0.841454545454546,0.754116976275968,43.24576271186441,43.02116402116402,42.65752953552355

India is a country that has long been associated with the pursuit of knowledge and learning. From the days of the ancient Vedic civilization to the modern era, India has been home to some of history’s most important thinkers and philosophers.
Today, however, the country is facing a crisis of ideas. In recent years, there has emerged a growing sense of intolerance and authoritarianism, as well as a climate of fear and repression. This has had a profound effect on the intellectual life of India, with many of its brightest minds leaving the county in search of more tolerant and open societies. As a result, it is more important than ever that we defend the spirit of free thought and critical inquiry in India.

India's defence relationship with the United States is a key pillar of the strategically important bilateral relationship. The two countries have been working closely in the field of defence for several years now.
The two have also been developing the capability to produce advanced military platforms and systems together. A number of joint programmes have already been initiated. These include the Joint Strike Fighter programme, the C-130J transport aircraft, and the UAVs. India is also seeking to buy the Boeing C17 transport plane, which is expected to be approved soon. In addition, India and US are working on the development of a new generation of jet fighter aircraft. This is the F-21 programme.

This study is an attempt to evaluate the foreign aid received by Pakistan and India and their military strengths and defence policies. It also tries to compare the military assistance and military capabilities of the two countries. The study uses a quantitative approach and relies on secondary data.
The study finds that India is the largest recipient of military equipment from the United States. India receives 40 per cent of all military sales from America. Pakistan is ranked second with 14 per cents of total military imports from USA. On the other hand, India’s military expenditure is 3.6 percents higher than that of Pakistan. Furthermore, the study reveals that Pakistan has a higher military-to-GDP ratio than India. This implies that the Pakistani military is more powerful than the Indian military.

India’s defence forces operate in a vast geographical area and require accurate position information for their operations. The Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) has developed a GPS/INS based navigation system called the INSAT Navigation System (INSNAV) for the Indian armed forces.
The INSNAR system is based on a single frequency GNSS receiver and an inertial navigation unit (IMU) with an accuracy of approximately 500 m.

There were no new contracts signed, but the contract for a $2 billion deal for 46 naval multi-role helicopters was given to the AgustaWestland, a company owned by the Finmeccaanca.

India is a major military power, with the world' s second largest armed forces. It has a wide range of capabilities, including nuclear weapons. Its defence budget is the third largest in the World. However, the defence spending is only about 2.2% of GDP, which is less than the 3% minimum that is recommended by the UN.
The defence budgets of other countries are much higher. For example, China'S defence outlay is about $ 110 billion, or 4.6%of GNP. This is more than double the Indian figure. The United States, on the other hand, spends about six times more on defence, about eight percent of its Gross National Product (GNP).

I have been reading about the Indian perspective on multiculuralisim and how it is different from the Western perspective.
It is true that there are some differences. The western perspective is based on the assumption that the individual is the unit of analysis and not the society. It is also based upon the idea that all cultures are equal and that they are in competition with each other. Therefore, it assumes that multicultural societies are inherently unstable. This is a very misleading assumption. In fact, multcultral societes are not inherantly unstabe. They are only unstabale if they have a weak political system. If the political systems are strong, then multculural socities can be stable. India is an example of a multulcual society that is stable despite having a large number of different cultrues. Another example is",466,180,0.5126582278481012,6.444014001823413,0.8680230447042022,0.06002616600782077,0.7666666666666666,0.7817910447761198,0.7306218041160963,31.751923076923077,35.18354430379747,34.12034411041785

The country is home to a number of leading defence companies, including Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, and Larsen & Toubro.

By R. Sridhar
The Indian Army has been working on its network-enabled warfighting concept for some time. But the concept of network centricity and the associated need for cyberexpertise has not been fully assimilated by the force. The Indian Air Force (IAF) has done better. It is already a networked force and is looking to further enhance its capabilities. In contrast, the Indian Navy is still struggling to integrate its networks. However, it has started to address the cybernetworking aspect of its war-facing capabilities and has begun to recruit cybettroops.

This book examines the reasons for the apparent lackadaisical approach to defence procurement and provides a detailed analysis of the various arms imports over the past two decades. It looks at the procured equipment, the defence and strategic environment in which it was acquired, its role in the development of Indian defence industries, India' s defence doctrine and the country'S political and economic situation.

India’s economic performance in the last decade has been remarkable. It has not only achieved sustained growth in GDP and per capita income, but has also reduced poverty and inequality. However, the performance of the economy has fallen short of its potential and the pace of economic transformation has remained slow. The country has failed to achieve the twin objectives of high growth and inclusive development.
The slowdown in economic activity during the first quarter of 2012-13, followed by a sharp slowing down of growth during 1QFY14, has raised concerns about the sustainability of India’ s high economic momentum.

The paper presents a framework for simulation of policy scenarios in a developing country, using a large scale macro-economic model. The model is used to simulate the impact of a range of fiscal policy measures, including changes in tax rates, on output, inflation and the balance of payments. It is shown that the model can be used for policy analysis, and that it can also be applied to the analysis of alternative fisca l policies.

The twenty five years since the 1991 economic reforms in India have been a rollercoaster ride for the Indian economy. The initial rebound of the economy was followed by a slowdown in the early 200s, a period of rapid growth in 05-08, but then the recession in late 70-71. In 94-95, the GDP growth rate was 5.5% and in recent years it has been around 6.8% per annum.
In this book, Ravi S. Saraf, an economist with more than 30 years experience in both the private and public sectors, describes the economic development in post-reform India. He traces the evolution of revenue and expenditure policies, investment and trade policies and the impact",6,180,0.5632911392405063,7.080459829163997,0.8866275774478346,0.05156439502314967,0.8733333333333334,0.85641791044776,0.7678077147480832,53.552970929482655,53.38607594936709,53.52184160905091

The Indian economy is the sixth largest in the world and is one of the fastest growing major economies. It is a mixed economy in which the private sector plays a significant role, but the state still plays an important role. India is an emerging economy and a newly industrialized country.
India is ranked 122nd in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index for 2010. The country has made significant progress in reducing poverty. According to the World Bank, the proportion of people living below the poverline fell from 45.8% in 91994 to 37.2% of Indians in poverta in May 00, and to just 8.6% by 70 in September 50

During the course of the nineteenth century, the Indian economy was transformed. The pre-colonial economy had been based on agriculture and subsistence. By the early twentieth century it was an economy based largely on industry.
This transformation was due to a combination of factors. First, there was the impact of British rule. British policies of trade restriction and tariffs had the effect of making the import of manufactured goods into India prohibitively expensive. Second, technological innovations, such as the steam engine, led to the development of a wide range of new industries. Third, a large number of Indian entrepreneurs and capitalists invested in new and existing industrial enterprises. Fourth, British capital and expertise were used to establish new enterprise. Fifth and finally, Indian labour was employed in a range and variety of industrial enter-pris es.",10,186,0.5433526011560693,7.146687659935232,0.8816296727941662,0.05289003074617265,0.8133333333333334,0.8182550335570471,0.7554559426025622,44.31835604770017,47.59537572254335,48.60575757575758
Indian economy,"on the dynamics of energy consumption, co₂ emissions and economic growth: evidence from india","on the dynamics of energy consumption, co₂ emissions and economic growth: evidence from india
Chandran, A.
The paper examines the relationship between economic development and environmental degradation in India. The study analyses the effects of economic activity on energy demand, CO₂ emission and their implications on economic welfare. It is argued that there is a trade-off between the two. While economic activities lead to an increase in energy and CO2 emission, they also lead an improvement in the standard of living of the people. However, the paper argues that the adverse effects on environment outweigh the benefits of increased economic output. This is because the level of CO 2 emitted in a country is not only a function of its economic level but also of other factors such as the technological level, energy intensity and the type of fuels used for energy generation. These factors determine the environmental impact of a given level and type economic performance. Therefore, it is important to determine these factors before",11,190,0.5243243243243243,7.131581834309935,0.8763216784048902,0.054551810101402566,0.8457142857142858,0.8549068322981369,0.7673664925586605,56.313657407407405,55.58918918918919,54.47008292368042

Indian economy,the growth and sectoral composition of india's middle class: its impact on the politics of economic liberalization,"the growth and sectoral composition of india's middle class: its impact on the politics of economic liberalization
India’s economic reforms are a unique experiment in the history of development. The reform process began in 1991, when India was in a deep economic crisis and had to choose between two options: to continue with the status quo, or to adopt a strategy of liberalizing the economy. This was the first time that a developing country had undertaken such a radical reform.
The success of the reformation process is not only due to the political leadership but also to a new middle-class segment in Indian society. In the past, middle classes were characterized by a strong sense of nationalism, which was reflected in their support for socialism and state-controlled economies. But this is no longer the case. Today, the middleclass is more pro-market and more open to globalization. They are also more educated and better informed about the world economy than ever",13,183,0.5760869565217391,7.8144236762095485,0.894246700413856,0.046693954150191584,0.8571428571428571,0.8625000000000004,0.789822282549739,67.02121913580247,65.19565217391305,59.952503494726145

This paper examines the role of the manufacturing sector in national as well as regional economic growth in India. The paper also analyses the growth of manufactures and services in different regions of India for the period 1980-81 to 2001-02. It is found that the contribution of regional manufacture to national manufactured output is negligible. However, the regional contribution to the total national services output has been significant. In spite of this, there has not been much regional diversification in terms of economic activity. There is a need for a regional strategy to promote manufactural growth.

In this paper, we examine the impact of economic development on the employ- ment structure. We use data from the World Bank for 129 countries for the period 2005–2103 to estimate the effect of per capita GDP on total employments. Our results show that economic devel- opment has a positive and significant effect on both total and non-agricultural employ.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people face a wide range of issues in relation to economic and social development. Many of these issues have been addressed through a series of government-funded programs, but these have generally failed to improve outcomes. A more effective approach is required to address the issues facing Indigenous people and to provide a framework for future policy development and program implementation.
In 2003, the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development (Harvard Project) was commissioned by the United States Government to develop a comprehensive framework to guide economic policy and development programs for Indigeneous communities. The Harvard framework was developed over a five-year period and was based on the principles of self-determination, selfgovernance and selfsufficiency. It has been used to inform the development of a number of programs in the US and is now being applied",16,186,0.5459770114942529,7.201931413999582,0.882695886646897,0.05235507027708387,0.9333333333333332,0.900266666666666,0.7820860359066849,61.92713279842803,61.333333333333336,61.885559208011614

The novel coronavirus outbreak, which has now spread to more than 80 countries, has disrupted the global supply of products and services. The outcomes of this pandemic have been felt by people across the globe, especially those in the developing countries like India.
India’s economy is dependent on manufacturing and service sectors. It is a major exporter of goods and is the world’ topmost supplier of pharmaceutical products. India’ economy, therefore, is highly dependent upon the supply and demand of these products, and the effects of the Covid1-9 outburst have already been seen in this sector. There has been a decline in demand for pharmacy products in India, with a decrease in consumption of antibiotics and other medicines.

The Indian economy has been through a long and painful process of economic reform. The first round of re-form, in the early 80s, was aborted in 4-5 years. A second round, launched in July 90, has made considerable progress, but is still in its early stages. In the process, it has become clear that grad-ualist reflation of the economy, a key part of this reform package, is not a panacea for the Indian economic ills.
It is now well accepted that the key to growth in India is the restructuring of its economy. This is because the economic growth of India in recent years has not been a result of growth-oriented investment, as in China, or a growth strategy based on exports, like that of East Asian countries. Rather, growth has come from a combination of both, with a large and growing share of it being a consequence of increased consumption.",21,200,0.5052083333333334,7.0003720139242125,0.8701312421201326,0.05687762799199576,0.84,0.839761904761906,0.742212666834678,47.878172588832484,50.270833333333336,46.092730496453896

The Effects of Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth
In the past few decades, foreign Direct investors have been a major source of capital for many developing countries, including India. The Indian government has been encouraging foreign companies to invest in India, by providing them with various incentives. These in-centive policies have helped to boost the Indian economy, and have also helped India to attract more foreign capital.
Foreign Direct is a type of investing that is done by a foreign company in a country other than its own. Foreign direct is the investor’s ownership of 10% or more of the voting stock of an enterprise that has its assets in another country. It is usually used to refer to a company’

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, as amended, has provided a legal framework for the expansion of tribal gaming enterprises. However, tribally-owned casinos and resorts are still relatively rare. In the first half of the 20th century, the federal government tried to suppress tribals' economic activity. Today, however, there are more than 300 tribaly-operated casino and bingo facilities in 64 states. This book argues that the success of Indian gambling is due to the combination of a favorable legal and regulatory framework and the cultural and institution- al characteristics of American Indians.

The world has long been familiar with the economic and cultural achievements of Europe and Asia. But the history of Asia before Europe has been largely ignored. The result is a skewed view of world history, which makes the discovery of America and the European conquest of India and China appear to be the most important events of their time. This book provides a new perspective on the civilizations of South and Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and East Asia from 600 to the present. It describes the long-term processes that gave rise to a distinctive civilization in each region, traces the development of a trading network that linked the regions, demonstrates the importance of this network in the growth of civilizational centers, examines the role of China in this process, shows how the network was disrupted by the advent of Islam, describes how this disruption was overcome by local innovations,",26,187,0.5351351351351351,7.2786247587286965,0.8802311574356421,0.05282742417078507,0.8057142857142857,0.8002484472049697,0.7476077216536061,43.634049773755656,43.57297297297297,41.43214110730034

The author, a retired professor of economics from the University of Delhi, has done a good job of presenting the success story of India. He has also done well in dispelling some of the myths about India and Indians.
As far as the Indian economic miracle is concerned, the author is right in saying that the country's economy is a miraculous success. It has not only achieved the fastest growth rate in the world, but it has managed to maintain a stable currency. The author has rightly said that India has achieved this success despite the fact that it is not a rich country. In fact, India' s economy has been growing at a rate of 8 per cent per annum for the last 20 years. This is an impressive achievement. However, there is one thing that has to be noted.

Indian companies have grown in size and scale over the past decade. The number of companies with a turnover of over Rs. 100 crore has grown from 25 in 05-06 to 33 in FY11. There has been a surge in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from $1 billion in April 91 to $30 billion by March 8. A number
of Indian companies are now present in key global markets, including the US, Europe and China. In this context, it is important to ask: How is India's growth linked to the global economy? How does India benefit from globalisation? Is India a net beneficiary of global trade?

The Indian government launched a series of economic liberalization re-forms in 1991. This paper examines the impact of these refor-mations on the efficiency of Indian manufacturers, using a panel of 457 firms in the manufactu-ring sector between 2001 and 02. The empirical analysis employs the nonpara-metric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method to estimate the technical efficiency scores of each firm. We find that the reformation program has improved the overall efficiency in Indian manu facturing. In addition, the improvement in efficiency is not uniform across sectors and firm size. Our results show that reorganization of government bureaucracy, deregulation of capital markets, and trade liberaliza-tion have been the most important factors in increasing efficiency.

Agriculture is the largest sector of the Indian economy. The sector accounts for about 15% of GDP, employs about half the workforce and contributes about a third of total exports. It is also the single largest source of income for over 60% rural households. Yet, the sector has been in a state of stagnation for the last two decades.
In this article, we explore the politics of agricultural innovations in India. Innovations are essential to boosting agriculturally-led growth, which is a key policy objective in the country. However, in recent years, innovative capacity has declined. There has also been a fall in investment in agricultual research and development, and a decline in public funding of R&D. This has had a negative impact on agricultury, especially on the small farmers. We argue that the declining public investments",39,193,0.5389221556886228,6.964409092807231,0.8792135815821592,0.05434180201826599,0.82,0.8349650349650355,0.7559743272509419,41.93293573515093,45.64071856287425,46.224830316742086

The Indian economy is a vibrant and dynamic economy with a rapidly growing population and a large number of people living below the poverty line. It is also the world's largest democracy and has a very strong democratic system of governance. The Indian government has been liberalizing its economy for the past several years, and this has led to significant changes in the way the economy functions. In this essay, we will take a look at the Indian Economy since Liberalization: The Structure and Composition of Exports and Industrial Transformation (250-556 words).

The repartition system, or reparación, was a form of labor obligation imposed on indigenous peoples in the Spanish colonies. The repayment system was instituted in Oaxacan during the eighteenth century, but was abolished in 878. This thesis explores the economic history of Oaaxca during this period, with a particular focus on the role of re-payment.

Indian economy,economic liberalization and indian economic growth: what's the evidence?,"economic liberalization and indian economic growth: what's the evidence?
Economic liberalisation in India has been a source of controversy since the mid-1980s. The debate has centred on whether economic reforms have helped to increase the rate of economic development in the country, and if so, by how much. This paper presents a systematic analysis of the empirical evidence on this issue. We find that the data do not support the view that economic reform has led to an acceleration in economic activity.
The paper is based on a study of all the papers published in 10 major journals in economics over the last 20 years. These papers are classified into those that are pro-reform and those which are anti-liberalisation. It is found that, while the proponents of liberalism have published more papers than the opponents, the number of papers that support liberal reform is less than 50% of those published by the opposers.

GST has been one of the biggest reforms in the Indian economy. The impact on the economy will be positive, but the implementation has to be done in a smooth manner.
The impact will vary from sector to sector, and from state to state. Some sectors will benefit and some will lose out. This will happen in both the short term and long term. In the long run, the impact is likely to benefit the country as a whole. But in short-term, there will likely be a negative impact, especially in securities. As a result, companies may need to re-evaluate their business strategies. It is also likely that the new tax regime will increase the cost of doing business. However, this will not affect the overall economy in India. GST is expected to have a positive impact. For instance, it will boost the GDP of India, as well as increase tax revenue.

The Indian economy has been growing at a rapid pace for the last few years. The rate of growth has accelerated from 4.8 per cent in 1994-95 to 8.9 per cen t in the current fiscal year. This is a remarkable performance, particularly in view of the fact that India is one of those countries where the growth rate has slowed down in recent years, and where it has actually declined in some countries. In the 20th century, the average growth of per capita income in India was only 0.5 per
cent per annum. It has now acceler ated to more than 3 per year and the country is poised to become a major economy of world in a few decades.

This book is an attempt to trace the growth of mono-poly capitalism and private capital in the Indian economy and to analyse the process of its relative expansion. The book discusses the impact of the two on the economy in terms of growth in output and employment, the composition of capital formation, and its distribution in income and wealth. It also deals with the effects of these developments on public investment and public sector development.
The book also traces the evolution of two distinct modes of private investments, viz., monopsony and monpoly, in India and examines their relative contribution to the expansion of output, employement and capital accumulation in different sectors of economy. This is done in a way which avoids the usual confusions in conceptualisation of such investmens. A number of important conclusions are drawn from the study of relative investement in these two modes.",67,197,0.46774193548387094,6.379149503428868,0.8545971317590281,0.06406787351066569,0.8285714285714285,0.8224691358024687,0.7265526901252967,46.5,45.77956989247312,40.61846187943262

The Indian industrial relation system is facing a crisis. The traditional tripartite model of industrial democracy, wherein the state, employers and trade unions collectively negotiate labour policies, is under severe stress. It is no longer able to respond to the challenges of the global economy, which is characterized by increased labour flexibility and the predominance of non-unionized and informal employment. This article examines the key challengers to this system, and argues that the current crisis is a result of structural changes in the economy that are undermining the foundations of tri-partism.

India has been a self reliant country since independence. It has a great history of self sufficiency and self development. But after independence it has become dependent on other countries for its development and it is now facing a lot of problems.
It is a fact that India has achieved a certain level of economic selfsufficiency. However, there are some problems which need to be addressed to ensure that this selfreliant economy is maintained. In this paper, we will discuss the problems that need attention and how they can be solved. We will also discuss how India can become more selfdependent in the future.",69,197,0.5564516129032258,6.196382919923734,0.8783940205504983,0.05808957665405931,0.84,0.8412000000000002,0.7791498527608903,41.282988225740965,49.314516129032256,45.69817444219067

The solar power industry in India is growing at a rapid pace. The Indian government has set a target of 100 GW of solar capacity by 2022. Solar energy is a renewable energy source that can be used to generate electricity.
Solar energy has the potential to play a major role
in the Indian economy in the future. India has a large population and a growing middle class, which means that there is significant demand for energy. In addition, India’s climate is well suited for solar generation, as the country has high levels of sunlight and relatively little cloud cover. This makes solar an attractive option for generating electric power in
India. solar panels are relatively easy to install and maintain, and they can provide electric
power for both residential and commercial applications. Overall, solar is an affordable and reliable option
for meeting India's growing energy needs.",73,191,0.5056179775280899,6.745785200962753,0.868390126036164,0.05848236054994469,0.8742857142857143,0.8709090909090902,0.7631213039966297,59.41202475685235,52.95505617977528,54.319016941064184

Abstract: This paper examines the role of human
capital in India’s economic growth between 2
and 45 years of age. It finds that the relative
importance of education and health has increased
over time. In the 8-15 year age group, the
contribution of health to the economy is
substantially higher than that of schooling.
This is true for both males and females. For
16-44 year olds, school-education is more
important than health. This suggests that

India’s economic and political development has been remarkable, but there are still many challenges to be met.
In 1947, India gained its independence from Britain and was partitioned into two countries – India and Pakistan. India was the largest of the two new countries, with a population of 360 million. The new nation was divided into states and provinces, and a constitution was written that provided for a federal system of government. A bicameral parliament was established, consisting of a lower house, the Lok Sabha, which was elected by the people, as well as an upper house called the Rajya Sabah, whose members were appointed by state governments. In 2008, a new constitution, called “The Constitution of India,” was adopted, establishing a more powerful central government and more democratic institutions. Since then, there have been several changes to the constitution.

In this paper we have investigated the relationship between the yield curve and the real activity of the Indian economy. We have used the term structure of interest rates to examine the relation between yield and economic growth. The empirically derived results indicate that the shape of yield curves can be used to predict the direction of growth in real GDP. Further, we also find that changes in the slope of these yield-growth relationships are useful in forecasting the growth rate of Gross Domestic Product.

The Indian economy is growing at an annual rate of 8% and is likely to remain so in the near future. The economy has been growing steadily over the last two decades and has demonstrated a strong ability to withstand shocks. This has enabled the country to make substantial progress in reducing poverty and improving living standards.
There are a number of factors that have contributed to the growth of India's economy. One is the increasing openness of Indian markets, which has allowed for greater competition and efficiency. Another is India’s young and growing population, who are increasingly becoming more educated and skilled. Finally, India has a large and expanding middle class, with a growing appetite for consumer goods and services.

This article reviews the literature on rural-urban migration in Indian context. It discusses the factors that motivate migrating households to move from rural to urban areas, and the implication of this movement on the economic welfare of the migrated households. While the migration is motivated by the desire for higher income, it is also associated with the loss of social capital, which is a major cause of poverty in rural India. Hence, rural migration can be considered as a pover...

1.1 INTRODUCTION The economy of India is in the process of transformation from a centrally planned economy to a market oriented economy. The Government has been making concerted efforts to achieve this objective and has initiated far-reaching structural reforms in various sectors of the economy, particularly in agriculture and industrial sector. It is also important to note that the country has experienced significant macro-econonomic instability in recent years. This is due to the fact that India has a dual economy in which the two seperate seamless markets in industrial and agricultural goods are intertwined with each other. As a result, the policy makers have to take into account both the short term and the long term objectives while framing the economic policies. In the past, India had followed a policy of price control and administered prices.

The article examines the political economy of the economic reforms in India. It argues that the re-scaling of state intervention in the economy was a key feature of India’s economic liberalisation. The recalibration of government interventions in economic affairs, as reflected in both the structure and the content of revenue and expenditure policies, was an important part of this reorientation. This reorganisation of governments’ role in policy making was not simply a consequence of a change in government’ s ideology, but was also a result of its attempts to strengthen its position in a highly competitive political environment.

Introduction
In the early 1990s, the Indian government began to build a network of roads that would connect India' s towns and cities. The first phase of this project, from 2001 to 5, cost 66.8 billion rupees, and involved the construction of 7,092 kilometres of road. By 3031, it was estimated that India would need to spend 40.5 billion dollars on road construction every year to keep pace with its population growth and economic development. These projects are a part of a broader plan to improve India's infrastructure, which includes the development of new highways, airports, ports, railways and power plants.

India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, with a GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate of 7.5% in 2010-11. This is the highest growth recorded in a decade, and the growth is expected to continue at this rate in future. However, despite this rapid growth, India is still a poor country, as 37% of its population lives below the povertynline.
The povertnline is an internationally accepted measure of poverteness. It is defined as the level of income below which people cannot afford a certain standard of living.

Abstract: In this paper, I examine the intensity profile of Indian exports over the period 1990-2009. I use the concept of the index of intensive margin of trade (IIMT) to measure the extent to which exports are intensified or expanded in the sense that a higher IIMT indicates that the exported goods are more intensively traded. The results indicate that Indian export intensity has increased significantly in recent years.

It is based on a study of commodi-ties flows, which is an important aspect of economic geog-raphy. The study is intended to contribute to the debate on the nature and extent of regional disparities in India. In particular, it is aimed at understanding the dynamics and spatial distribution of these dispari- ties in relation to other aspects of spatial disparity. I have tried to identify the main sources of dispar- ity in terms of growth and employment, and to assess the extent to which the disparate regional economic structures are related to each other.

The study examines the sources and nature of growth in India over the period 1980-2007. The study uses the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) approach to measure the contribution of capital, labour and technology to the overall economic progress. It is found that TFP growth has been the main contributor to economic development in the last three decades. However, the growth rate of TFR has declined in recent years. This may be due to several factors such as the slowdown in investment, slow growth of labour force, declining quality of human resources, and inadequate investments in R&D.

This paper examines the relationship between exports (merchandise) and GDP growth for India for the period 1970-2-009. The study is based on the time series data for 50 years. It is found that exports are found to be significant in explaining the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of India. But there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that Growth in exports is a result of growth or vice-versa. This is because, in India, exports have not been able to play a leading role in the growth process.

In the mid-18th century, the French philosopher Voltaire wrote a letter to the English economist David Hume in which he said: “I do not know which is more surprising, that so many people have not read Homer, or that those who have read him have understood him so little.” The same could be said of the Indian economy in the past decade and a half. It is surprising that the policy-makers and policy analysts have failed to understand the impact of their actions on the economy.

The Economic Survey for 2022-23 was tabled in Parliament on 31 January. It is the last report of the Modi government before the elections to the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies. The survey has been prepared by the Chief Economist of NITI Aayog, Dr V Anantha Nageswaran.
In the preface to this year' s survey, the author says that India is in the midst of a crisis. This is true. But he does not mention the causes of this crisis, which is an omission of great importance. Nor does he make any suggestions for overcoming this situation. He does, however, suggest a number of measures that are intended to boost the economy. These are, he says, ""measures to restore macroeconomic stability and support growth"".

Indian economy,growth and composition of rural non-farm employment in india in the era of economic reforms,"growth and composition of rural non-farm employment in india in the era of economic reforms
M. S. Bhanot
This paper examines the growth of nonf arm employments in rural India during 1983-2002. It is found that the share of the non farm sector in total employ ment increased from 51.1 to 66.8 per cent during the period. The sectoral composition, however, remained unchanged. There is a general trend towards employing more persons in agriculture, forestry and fishing. However, the sector employed more women than men. During the same period, employ ments in industry and services increased. Employment in services grew at a faster rate than in industries. In the case of industry, there is evidence of growth in both organized and unorganized sectors.

The article examines the nature of domestic abuses in India, including economic violence. It discusses the ways in which the Indian law on domestic assault has been interpreted to provide protection for women against such abusive behaviour. The article also highlights the shortcomings of the current law in this regard and suggests that the law needs to be re-interpreted to include economic violation within the definition of ""cruelty"" in order to protect women from this form of abused.

M. S. Arora
A small structured macro-economic model is constructed to analyze the impact of external economic shock on the Indian economy. The model has 10 sectors, 20 commodities, and 40 equations. It is used to simulate the economic performance of the country for the period 01.04.1991 to 31 March 94, with a time horizon of 5 years.
The results of simulation show that the economy is quite sensitive to the external conditions. Even a 7% change in the growth rate of world output has a significant impact on India's growth. If world growth increases by 6%, the rate is 8.5%, and if it decreases by the same percentage, the effect is to reduce the domestic growth by about ½ percent.",139,186,0.5506329113924051,6.921348372328851,0.882138130646484,0.053606299069027676,0.8333333333333334,0.8498507462686574,0.7738559640147878,52.666666666666664,54.4873417721519,54.17705827318899

The Indian economy is undergoing a major transformation from a manufacturing-based economy to a services-led economy. The services are now the mainstay of the Indian economic growth. In this context, the present study aims to analyse the growth of service sector and its implication for the economy at large.

P. K. Rath, S. Mishra
This paper examines the neo-classical environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for India by using multidimensional co-integration techniques. The study uses a panel data set of 14 Indian states from 2004 to 09. Our results show that the carbon emission per capita and GDP per capital are cointegrated in India. Furthermore, the study finds that both the variables are non-stationary in the long-run. A nonlinear relationship between the two variables has been found in all the states. In addition, we find that carbon dioxide emitted per unit of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has a decreasing relationship with GNP per person in most of the Indian States. However, in some states like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Punjab, this relationship is found to",147,197,0.6242424242424243,8.018539124863686,0.9077121978525616,0.04161825044471933,0.9066666666666666,0.9038297872340427,0.837616647758,89.90344043068214,85.7030303030303,58.82610169491525

The results show that the crisis had a significant impact on households’ energy use and behavior. However, the magnitude of these effects was not uniform across households and regions. In particular, households with better access to electricity were less affected by the energy and economic crises.

GST is the most significant tax reform in India since the independence. It is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that is levied on every value addition. The tax is collected at every stage of supply of goods or services, right from the manufacturing stage to the retail stage.
The tax was introduced in the country on 1st July 2017. This tax replaced multiple taxes levies by the central and state governments. GST was implemented in a phased manner. Initially, GSTR 3B was filed for July and August 5. Then, the filing of GTR 6 was started from September. Now, all the taxpayers are required to file GTS 8.

Social entreprenurship is a term that has been around for a few decades now, but it is only recently that women have started to play a more active role in the field. There are many reasons for this, and one of them is the fact that more and more women are starting to see the potential for social change through entreprenuership.
There are also a number of other factors that have contributed to the rise of women in social enterprise, such as the increasing number women who are now going to college and the growing number who have access to education and resources. In addition, there has also been an increase in women-led startups, which is another factor that is helping to drive the trends.

The paper empirically investigates the relationship between crucial macroeconomic variables like infl ation, economicgrowth and crudefuel price. The study is basedon the concept of structuraldynamic panel data model. Using annual data of India from 1990 to 2010, the study finds that there is a significant and negative relationship of crudepetroleum price with inflat ion and growth rate. This implies that an increase in crudedoil price leads to higher inflatio n and lower economic grow th rate in India.

The concept of Foreign Direct Investment (F.D.I.) was first introduced by R.C.Morgan and A.W.Thompson in 1970. Since then it has become an important part of the world economy. F. D. I. is an investment made by a firm or an individual in one country by establishing a business in another country. The investor may be a resident of a different country, or may not be. In the case of resident investors, F D I is usually made in the form of equity. On the other hand, non-resident investments are made through loans, bonds, etc.

The Indian economy has experienced a large scale shift in its energy mix over the last few decades.
A large part of this change has been due to the rise in fossil fuel use, which has led to increased emissions and air pollution. In addition, the Indian government has also been promoting renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. This has resulted in a shift away from coal and natural gas towards these cleaner sources of energy. The Indian electricity sector is the largest consumer of coal in India, accounting for 70% of total energy consumption. Coal is used to generate electric power in thermal power plants, and is also used as a fuel for industrial processes. India has large reserves of both coal-bed methane and shale gas, but these resources are not being fully exploited due mainly to concerns over environmental impacts. However, there is increasing pressure on the government to increase production",163,191,0.5333333333333333,7.155417527999327,0.8789497626357874,0.05367432853027564,0.8971428571428571,0.9084615384615373,0.7945879811963226,57.60158840075253,66.0,61.048074807480745

This paper empirically examines the impact of sustained superior financial performance on the firm's ability to maintain superior growth performance. The paper is motivated by the fact that in emergent economies, the financial markets are in a nascent stage, and firms often exhibit poor corporate governance practices. Hence, financial managers need to exercise extreme caution while making investment decisions. This paper uses the Indian context to empiricially test the effect of superior corporation performance (measured by return on equity) on superior firm growth (as measured by sales growth). The results of the study show that superior firmed performance is associated with superior long-term firm performance, but this association is not robust to all the control variables.

American Indian Economic Development
The American Indian economic condition has been and continues to be a national tragedy. As a result of the United States government’s policy of assimilation, American Indians were forced to live on reservations and were denied the right to own property, to vote, and to practice their own religion. They were also denied access to education, health care, housing, land, employment, food, water, clothing, shelter, transportation, legal and judicial services, business opportunities, credit, social services and other basic needs.
Today, the American economy is the most unequal in the developed world. The richest 1% of Americans own 40% or more of our nation’ s wealth. By contrast, 25% percent of American families have no wealth at all.

This paper presents an empirical model for the estimation of prices in India. The model is based on the assumption that the price of a commodity is a function of the demand for and supply of that commody. In addition, the model assumes that price is influenced by the level of income, interest rates and the rate of growth of real GDP. Estimates of demand and income elasticities of price are made using the estimated model. Finally, estimates of changes in prices are derived from the estimates made of elasticiies of supply and demand.

The Indian Ports Act 1908, which is the basic statute governing the working of Indian ports, was enacted in the colonial era, when India was still a part of the British Empire. The Act was amended in 2005, in order to provide for the establishment of a National Port Authority for each of India’s major ports.
In the last 30 years, the Indian economy has been growing at a rapid pace. However, despite this, our ports have not kept pace with the rapid growth of our economy. As a result, we have been unable to take advantage of new opportunities and new technologies. In order for us to compete in today’ s global market, it is essential that we improve the efficiency of port operations and increase the capacity of ports to handle larger vessels.

The labour market in India has always been characterized by an abundance of cheap, unskilled labour. It is, therefore, not surprising that the contract system of labour supply has been the dominant mode of employment in the country. The contract labour system has, in fact, been an integral part of the economy, and the Indian labourers have been its most important resource.
Sardar was the term used by the British for the ‘contractor’. A sarkar or sadr was a Muslim contract laborer, who supplied labor to the employers for a fixed sum of money. In the nineteenth century, the sikarwar or the khandan was another term for contractors. These terms were later replaced by kadar, kanwar, jagirdar and jobber.

Energy efficiency is the key to sustainable development and environmental protection. The study attempts to measure the energy performance of Indian manufacturers and to determine the factors affecting energy consumption. This paper uses the data from 145 manufactures from various sectors in India. Energy performance is measured using the methodology proposed by the European Union. It is found that the average energy intensity is 0.46 GJ/INR 2005, which is lower than the benchmark value of 3.1 Gj/ INR. There is a positive and significant correlation between energy use and energy price. On the other hand, there is an inverse and positive relationship between the size of the firm and the use of energy.

This has led to the emergence of a new India, with a growing economy and a stronger political will to address the issues of poverty and social inequality. The economic reform process has brought about a sea change in the Indian economy, from a centrally planned economy to a market-oriented one.

The book is an attempt to analyze the impact of economic reforms on Indian agricultural sector at the state level. The analysis of data on agriculturally important crops and crop productivity at state-level is done for the period 1975-2003. To assess the effect of the economic policy re-forms, the data is divided into two periods- pre-reform (1st July 80) and post- reform (after 30th June 91). The book presents a comprehensive picture of Indian state agricultures in the post liberalization era. It also provides a comparative analysis between the performance of states in pre and after reform periods.

The causal relationship between economic development and energy use has been the subject of much debate in recent years. In particular, the relationship has attracted the attention of environmental economists who have argued that energy efficiency is an important component of economic policy in the transition to a low-carbon economy. This paper attempts to shed light on the causation between the two variables by examining the literature on India, a country which is often cited as an example of a developing country that has achieved high economic performance with low energy intensity. The results of the analysis indicate that the evidence is inconclusive and that it is not possible to reject the null hypothesis of no causational relationship.

Role of Agriculture In Making India $ 5 Trillin Economy Under Corona Pandemic Circumstance
The Indian agricultural sector is the backbone of the Indian economy. It contributes about 17% to the GDP, 45% of total exports, and 26% total employment. In addition, it provides food and nutrition security to 60% population of India. The agriculturists are the most vulnerable and hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemics.
Agriculture is one of those sectors that has been hit hard by COVID 9. Agricultural production has come down by 30%.

Indian Economy: The Role of Property Rights and the Legal System
By: Ravi Kanbur
This paper examines the role of property right in India's economy. It first presents a brief overview of the Indian economy and its legal system, with a focus on property. The paper then discusses the effects of weak property protection on economic activity in general and on agriculture in particular. Finally, it presents some evidence on the impact of legal reform on land rights.
The Indian Economic System and Legality
Since the early 1990s, the Government of India has embarked on a series of economic reforms aimed at restructuring the economy, opening it up to the world, and improving the quality of life of its citizens. One of these re-forms, which is not often discussed, is the reform of land tenure and property laws. A major obstacle to economic development",195,194,0.5232558139534884,6.862435664967211,0.8741747447421963,0.05628434540023875,0.84,0.8537837837837844,0.7551473607512786,53.06237584425904,54.21511627906977,53.200006089392275

This article examines the development of the British colonial medical service in India between 0 and 50. It explores the relationship between the colonial administration and the medical profession in the context of a colonial health policy that was predicated on a model of preventive medicine. The article argues that the introduction of malariology and its adoption as the key component of British India’s public health strategy was a crucial part of this policy. In this sense, the article reconsiders the role of colonial medicine in terms of its contribution to the emergence of modern epidemiology. At the same time, it also re-examines how the discipline of epistemology is intertwined with the practice of medicine and public policy, and how this was influenced by the political and economic context.",198,192,0.5095541401273885,6.384695075740977,0.8666561720632209,0.06072400794384245,0.7999999999999999,0.8267669172932332,0.732032971537577,47.458768007948336,46.54140127388535,46.18457357859532

India is the second fastest growing economy in Asia and is also the third largest economy after China and Japan. India’s economy is a mixed economy. It has a lot of public sector companies and also a large private sector. However, the public companies are not as large as the private companies.

The Indian economy has been growing at an impressive rate over the past few years. This has led to an increase in the demand for private investment in India. Private equities are a form of investments that are made by private individuals or groups of people. These investors are looking for long-term returns on their invest-ments.
Private equites are usually made in companies that have been established for more than five years and have a history of profitability. The investor will typically invest in a company that has a strong management team and is well-capitalized. Investors will also look for companies with a good track record of growth and profit.

The causation relationship is a special type of relationship that is characterized by the fact that one variable has a direct effect on another variable. The relationship can be positive or negative. A positive causative relationship means that the effect of one factor on the other is positive.
This type is most commonly found in the field of economics. It is also used in other fields such as psychology, sociology and education. In economical terms, it is the relationship of cause and effect between two variables. For example, if we were to look at the effects of inflation on unemployment, we would find that there is an inverse relationship (i.e., the higher the inflations rate, the lower the un- employment rate).

The Indian economy has been in a state of turmoil since the global financial crisis of 2008. In the last four years, the country has witnessed a series of macroeconomic imbalances, which have affected both the financial sector and the real economy. The Indian government has tried to address these im balances by adopting a number of policy measures. However, these measures have not been able to achieve their desired objectives. This paper attempts to analyse the reasons for the failure of these policies and suggests some measures that can be taken to improve the situation.

Indian economy,goods and services tax: it's impact on indian economy,"goods and services tax: it's impact on indian economy
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a tax on consumption of goods or services. It is proposed to be levied at all stages right from manufacture to final consumption with credit of taxes paid at previous stages available as set-off. The GST is expected to subsume a large number of Central and State tax laws, including the Central Excise Duty, the Additional Excises Dutiy (AED), the Service Tax, Central Sales Tax and the State Value Added Tax.
In the GDP calculations, it is assumed that the final consumer price will be the same as the price at which the goods are produced. This is not the case in the real world. As a result, Gross Domestic Product is an overestimate of the actual production in a country.

This paper examines the factors that explain the implementation of revenue-raising and expenditure-cutting regressive re-forms in India's power industry in the 1990s. The paper finds that the recessionary effects of the power refor-mations were exacerbated by the fact that they were introduced at a time when the Indian economy was experiencing a severe downturn. It also finds the presence of a large number of unreformed, inefficient, loss-making, state-owned enterprises that were competing with the reformed, efficient, profit-oriented private sector companies. As a result, the overall competitive position of India’s private companies was weak",225,197,0.6103896103896104,7.574735861838574,0.9019927604823852,0.044802885103707175,0.8466666666666667,0.8409230769230771,0.7907495449439783,57.962242859257074,60.8051948051948,52.1059866962306

They are considered to be the leaders of tomorrow and are expected to take over the reins of leadership in all spheres of life. However, this is not the case in India.
A large number are unemployed, underemployment is rampant and the majority are underpaid. This has led to a growing sense of frustration and alienation among the youth. It is also a matter of concern for the government and other stakeholders as it is the largest section in terms of number and it has the potential to lead the nation to prosperity.

Bread and Ballot is the first book to compare the United States and India in the post-World War II period, focusing on the role of the U.S. in India' s economic and political development. The United states was the only country to provide significant aid to India, but the relationship was not always smooth.
Robert A Prestons study examines the ways in which the two countries tried to improve the lives of their people. He shows that the aid the US provided to the Indian government was far greater than the amount of aid provided by the Soviet Union and China combined, and that it was critical to Indias economic growth and to its political stability.

Economic growth in India is mainly driven by agriculture. About 60% of the population is employed in agricultural activities. Agriculture contributes to about 17% to the GDP. This is the highest contribution to GNP in any country in Asia. The contribution of agricultures to total employment is about one-third.
The share of Agricultural Gross Value Added in GVA at factor cost at current prices has been declining from 22.4% in 31 March 00 to 8.2% as of 7 March, 40. During 90-91, the share declined to a low of about five percent. However, it has since increased to over 50%.

The power generation has grown from 12.6 billion units in 2001-02 to 98 billion in2 0 6-67 in India. This tremondousgrowth in generation is due to the addition of new generation capacity.
In the last decade, the per capita electricity consumption has increased by about 50 percent. However, this growth is not uniform in all parts of India due the uneven distribution of population and economic development.

With the onset of economic reforms in 4th July 91, the Indian economy has been witnessing a period of unprecedented economic growth. This period is characterized by a high rate of inflation and low rate unemployment. The infl ation rate has remained above 6% since 3rd quarter of 89-90. There has also been a steady fall in the rate and extent of employment in organized sector, particularly in public sector.

10.1 Introduction: The Economic Impact of Slavery
Slaves were an important part of West Indian economies. They were the backbone of agriculture and industry and provided the basis for the development of a commercial economy. The West Indies were also important as a source of raw materials for British industry. Slave-grown sugar was a major source for Britain's manufacturing industries. It was also a vital source, albeit indirectly, of wealth for many of Britain’s aristocratic families.
These economic links meant that Britain had a powerful interest in maintaining slavery. As a result, the slave-trade was protected by law and slavers were rarely prosecuted. But the British economy was changing. New industrial technologies were being developed in Britain and in the 1780s Britain began to export its manufactured goods to the West. These new products were che",240,196,0.5371428571428571,7.105732092573472,0.8796675806526433,0.053647070060997476,0.8285714285714285,0.824370860927152,0.7662325235240209,43.75,46.605714285714285,45.80358952091475

The geographical distribution of the Indian economy has been changing in the post 90s period. The share of agriculture in GDP has declined and the share in employment has increased. In contrast, the industrial sector’s share has decreased.
While the economy is becoming more service oriented, there are regional disparities in its structure. It is important to understand the spatial distribution and evolution of these changes in order to design policies to promote inclusive growth. This article examines the evolution and distributional changes of India’ s economy in post reforms period and attempts to explain the emergence of regional inequalities.

A.N. Sharma
The 1980s have seen a rapid growth in the production of scientific and technological knowledge in India. This growth has been accompanied by a growing interest in science and technology in both the public and private sectors. The growth of science is due to the increase in funding, and also to a greater emphasis on science education. There has also been an expansion in scientific research and development (R&D), and in technology development. These developments have led to an increase of the number of scientists, engineers and technical personnel, as well as to increased attention to science policy issues.

India’s growth story since the early 8s has been a story of polarization, with the benefits of growth accruing to the few and the majority left behind. This has resulted in the creation of a large number of ‘have nots’ in India, which is a major cause of social unrest in recent years. The Indian economy has also seen a rise in inequality, as the rich have become richer and poorer.
The Indian government has tried to address these issues by introducing various schemes and policies aimed at reducing inequality and poverty. However, these efforts have been largely ineffective, and India remains one of the most unequal countries in Asia. In order to reduce inequality in Indian society, the government must focus on creating jobs and providing education and healthcare to all citizens.",247,200,0.575,7.273238618387272,0.8909623082220898,0.04946994384875627,0.8666666666666667,0.8541176470588232,0.7835839144936398,57.6393646838991,60.125,51.64194247438928

China's rapid growth over the past few decades has been accompanied by a structurally transformation in the economy, with agricultural employment falling as manufactures employing a large number of workers has grown. This transformation has enabled China to make rapid progress in reducing poverty. In contrast, India' s economic growth has not been associated with a similar transformation. India is one of a few countries where agriculturists still dominate the workforce, and where the share of agriculturing in GDP is increasing.

A model for the growth and development of Indian economy, in the last few decades, has been evolved. The model is based on the following assumptions:
1. It is a dual economy.
2. Private sector is the engine of economic growth. In this model, the government plays a regulatory role. However, it is not a socialistic model. This model has two sectors: (a) the private sector and (b) government sector. Both the sector are interdependent. They complement each other. While the public sector provides the infrastructure, social and other services, private enterprise is expected to make use of these services and create wealth. Thus, both the sector complement and supplement each others’ activities. There is no conflict between the two. Hence, there is cooperation and coordination between them. Cooperation is more important than competition.

Indian Economy Amid Covid - 10 Lockdown
The Indian economy has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and the lock-down measures that have been put in place to control its spread. The Indian government has taken a number of measures to support the economy, including the announcement of a $22.6 billion stimulus package.
However, the impact of the pan-demic on the Indian economic outlook remains uncertain. In this article, we will take a look at the latest data on India’s economy and assess the potential impacts of Cov-id on its growth prospects. We will also provide some insights into the measures taken by India to mitigate the effects of this pandem-ic. Finally,
we will discuss the future of India's economic growth in the context of ongoing global economic turmoil.

The economic history of India has been a tale of two extremes. On the one hand, the country has witnessed a high level of economic growth in the post-1850 period. This was due to the introduction of the British rule and the subsequent economic and social re-structuring that the colonial regime brought about. The introduction and implementation of a liberal economic policy in 2014 by the present government of Narendra Modi is a continuation of this process. In the pre-colonial period, India was the richest country in Asia and its economy was based on the principles of self-sufficiency and non-exploitation of human and natural resources. However, during the period of British colonial rule, a process of industrialization and urbanization took place which resulted in a dramatic change in its economic structure.

I was just reading this article in the Economist, which I thought was a good summary of the state of things in India, and what the future may hold:
India has been growing at a healthy rate for the past decade, but its economy is woefully inefficient.
It has the second-highest number of poor people in Asia, after China. The number has not fallen as fast as the government had hoped, partly because the country’s population is growing rapidly. In 2001, 32.5% of Indians lived below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. By 1990, the figure was 45.2%.
The government has tried to improve matters. It has introduced a slew of reforms, including opening up the economy to foreign investment, privatising state-owned industries and cutting red tape.

As the impact on the economy has been severe, the government has taken several steps to help the businesses and individuals. These include the announcement of a Rs 60,00 crore package for the MSMEs, RBI’s moratorium on loans and reduction in repo rates by RBIs.

India’s economic growth has been accompanied by a structural transformation in the economy. Over the last decade, the share of services in GDP has increased from 44% to 53%, while the contribution of agriculture has declined from about 24.5% in 1991-92 to about
17.6% now. The share in manufacturing has remained almost constant at about one-fifth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The increase in services has led to a decline in employment in agricultural and manufacture sector.

The Economic Liberalisation of India
In 1991, India embarked on a course of economic liberalisation. This was a response to a severe balance of payments crisis, which threatened to undermine the country's political stability. The crisis had resulted from the inability of the government to meet the external financial needs of an increasingly import-dependent economy. It was resolved by a massive injection of foreign capital into the economy, through the sale of shares in public enterprises, and by the withdrawal of government controls over the domestic economy in order to attract foreign investment.
This book provides a critical analysis of these reforms. Drawing on detailed empirical research, it examines the extent to which the revised economic policy has succeeded in achieving its objectives.

Indian economy,an analysis of price and output behavior in the indian economy: 1951–1973,"an analysis of price and output behavior in the indian economy: 1951–1973
In this paper, an attempt has been made to study the behavior of prices and outputs in India for the period 5 years, 2010–2150. The study is based on the theory of the general equilibrium model. It has used the linearized model to estimate the price behavior. This paper has also used an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for estimating the output growth rate.
The results of this study show that the prices of food grains, fuel and light, and clothing and footwear have a positive relationship with the GDP. In addition, the results show a negative relationship between the rate of growth of GVA and the growth rates of inflation and unemployment. Thus, this research shows that there is a relationship among prices, output, unemploymnt, inflations, Gross Value Added (GVA), and GNP.",279,193,0.4619883040935672,6.041280991924793,0.8498120898908259,0.06725847367588941,0.82,0.8304761904761907,0.7275015502337705,39.0390625,42.21637426900585,40.62147034252297

The paper examines the role of infrastructural development in promoting economic growth in the Indian economy. The analysis is based on the System Dynamics (SD) model of economic development. This model is used to analyze the complex interrelationships between the various economic sectors and infrastruc- ture in India. It is found that the economy of India is characterized by a low level of per capita income, low levels of savings and investment, and high levels oi inflation. These problems are associated with a high level o f infrastru- cure deficit. In order to reduce the infrastrure gap, the government has initiated a number of policy measures to promote infrastrural develop- ment. However, these measures have failed to increase the rate of growth of GDP and to bring down the inflat- ion rate. Hence, it is suggested that in order for India to achieve its goal",280,199,0.5846994535519126,7.909667599213929,0.8969845964391701,0.04553265439789206,0.84,0.843018867924529,0.8054182022020134,54.42672413793103,56.39890710382514,46.58950651978417

Indian economy,an estimated dsge model of the indian economy,"an estimated dsge model of the indian economy
Several important macroeconomic policies are now being formulated in India, including a new monetary policy framework, a fiscal consolidation programme and an ambitious infrastructure development plan. A key question is how these policies will interact with each other and with the economy’s underlying dynamics to affect the Indian economy. We use an empirical dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model to assess the impact of these reforms on the macro-financial environment and the real economy, and to guide the design of policy.
We find that the proposed revenue-neutral fiscan consolida-tion plan, combined with a flexible inflation targeting regime, will lead to a more stable macrofin-an-cial equilibrium and will also improve the efficiency of public spending. However, the fis-cal plan will not be enough to bring down the government’sthird-party debt, which will remain very high.

India is a country with a large population and a very young one. It is also a developing country. In the last few decades, it has made remarkable progress in terms of economic growth. But this growth is not evenly distributed. Some regions and some groups of people are benefiting more from the growth than others. There is the danger of the poor falling further behind the rich. This situation has given rise to a new social movement called the Right to Development. A new paradigm is emerging.

Indian agricultural sector has played a vital role in the economic development of India. The agriculturists are the backbone of the country and the Indian agricultures have contributed a lot to the growth of Indian economy.
The contribution of agricultured to GDP is around 18% and it is the main source of livelihood for more than 60% of Indians. In India, agricultulture is mainly rain-fed and about 75% farmers depend on rainfall for irrigation. About 80 % of farmland is rain fed and only 20 per cent of land is irriagated. This is one of major reasons of low agricultrual production. India has a large number of small farms and there is no scope for mechanization in agricultuire. Most of these farmer are poor and illiterate.

This paper examines the relationship between macro-econometric variables and stock market returns in India. In order to examine this relationship, we use the vector error correction model (VECM). The results show that the Indian stock returns are cointegrated with macro variables. The long-run elasticities of the stock return with respect to the macro indication are negative, implying that Indian economy is not in a position to absorb the shocks of adverse macro economic conditions. This result is in line with the findings of previous studies.

The socialists who had been in power in India since 1947 were keen on maintaining their hold on power. In order to do that they had to keep the country poor and backward. So they kept the rate at which the economy grew low. They were also not too keen to improve the efficiency of the government departments or the bureaucracy.
In 2017, the Indian economy is expected to grow at 7.2% and in 5 years it is likely to reach 8%.
This is a remarkable improvement from the 3% rate in the early 90s. This improvement is due to the reforms that the Narendra Modi government has initiated.

“To the modern mind, the world of our ancestors seems so remote, so alien, that it is difficult to believe that we have any real kinship with them. The difference between the two worlds is so great that the very idea of a continuity between them is unthinkable.”
McNeil then goes on to explain that this is a misconception. “The human race, however, is one; we are all descended from the same ancestral population. We have the common human heritage to remind us that our distant ancestry is not so distant after all.” (Mcne",296,185,0.5739644970414202,7.461538461538462,0.8917741329269079,0.04857781450419806,0.86,0.859034482758621,0.7960559721384742,69.58081149319014,66.07100591715977,55.530092592592595

A study of the impact of cultural factors on the economic growth of India.
The study examines the relationship between culture and economic performance. The analysis is based on a review of literature on economic and cultural development. It examined the importance of culture in economic decision making and its impact on social, political and institutional development in India and other countries. A conceptual framework was developed to identify the role of values and institutions in the process of economic change. An empirical investigation was conducted to test the hypotheses. Data were collected from 2004 to 1998 for 30 Indian states and the Indian Union. Findings show that culture is an important factor in explaining the differences in state economic performances. In particular, the study found that the values of cooperation and consensus, which are prevalent in Indian culture, are associated with lower rates of growth.

The economic impact of the Covid1-9 pandemics has been felt worldwide. It is likely that the Indian economy will also be affected, with a major impact being felt on the GDP and the economy.
In the first quarter of 2021, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in India is expected to be 7.5 percent. However, this is lower than the previous quarter’s growth of over 8 percent, and it is also lower compared to the average growth in the last 5 years, which was 11.2 percent for the same period.

India is one of the most diverse and heterogeneous countries in the world. It is a federation of 29 states and seven union territories. In terms of its population, it is the second most populous country in terms (with a population of over 1.3 billion people) and the largest democracy in size. The country is home to over a thousand ethnic groups and more than 500 languages and dialects.
The Indian constitution provides for a strong federal structure and a high degree of autonomy for the states. This is not surprising, given that India has a long history of regionalism and decentralisation. For centuries, India was a collection of kingdoms and principalities, each with its own ruler and its distinctive culture. Even after the British Empire conquered India in 862, the country remained divided into many smaller states, some of which were",303,187,0.5789473684210527,7.570719217728538,0.8937029425667388,0.047602885172331806,0.8733333333333334,0.8677551020408167,0.7788971509534504,63.88078744250697,58.239766081871345,52.43757467144564

India has one of the largest and most dynamic economies in the world. India is also a country that has experienced a rapid growth in GDP per capita in recent years. This growth has been driven by a number of factors, including the country’s demographic dividend, its growing middle class, and its increasing economic openness.
One of India’ s most important economic indicators is its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Growth in India s GPD has slowed in 2016, but it remains one
of the fastest growing economics in Asia. One of
the reasons for this growth is that India has a

Paper on Impact of Macroeconomics Indicators of Indian Capital Market
In this paper we have discussed the impacts of various macro-econmic indicaters on the Indian capital market.
The capital is the main ingredient for the growth of an economy. The capital of the economy is invested in the various sectors of economy, in order to earn the return on it. A return is obtained on capital investment when the investor is able to sell the capital at a higher price than the cost price of capital. This is done through the process of investing in various assets like shares, bonds, gold, silver, etc. Investment in capital assets is known as capitalization. Capitalization is a process by which an investors earns the profit on his investments. There are various factors that influence the price at which the asset is sold. These factors are called as the determinants of asset price.",309,196,0.45454545454545453,6.030226891555272,0.8475080164408375,0.06790965187811779,0.7828571428571428,0.783947368421053,0.7108846741283683,32.266666666666666,33.32954545454545,31.72428878906981

A study by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the World Bank finds that women in India are more likely to work when their families are poorer, when they have less education, and when the economy is growing.
Increasing female workforce participation in developing countries is a key component of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for poverty reduction. The study examines the factors driving female employment in rural India, using data from the 2005-06 National Sample Survey of India. It finds significant differences in the determinants of labor supply for men and women. In particular, women are less likely than men to be working when family wealth increases, suggesting that they are not as responsive to economic incentives as men. This is especially true for women with more education. Women with less than a sixth-grade education are the most responsively to changes in family income.

India is a country with a population of more than one billion people. It is also a nation that has been struggling to find its place in the world for decades. In recent years, India has made great strides towards becoming a more free and open society, but there are still many challenges ahead.
The Indian economy is one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia, and it is expected to continue to grow at a rapid pace in coming years. However, there is still much work to be done in order to ensure that the Indian people have access to the same opportunities as those in other countries. One of India’s biggest challengers is its infrastructure, which is often poorly maintained and difficult to navigate. This makes it difficult for businesses to operate effectively and for people to access essential services such as healthcare and education. Another major challenge for India is poverty, as millions",319,189,0.5388888888888889,7.22995312724932,0.8809453091679659,0.05278949242835764,0.88,0.8823076923076922,0.7902742608432342,66.32538431217975,71.36111111111111,67.60075647835184

Economic reformation in India is a very difficult task. India has been a socialist country for decades and it is still the largest socialistic country in the world. The socialism has resulted in many social problems. One of the major problems is poverty. Poverty is an important issue for the Indian economy. It is one of those problems which have to be solved by the government. There are many ways to solve this problem. But the most important one is to reform the economic system. Economic reform is the key to the solution of poverity. In this paper we will discuss about the ideas that have been proposed to re-form the economy of India. We will also discuss the impact of these ideas on the development of Indian society. Finally we shall discuss how these refor-mations are implemented in practice. 1. Introduction 2.

India is a developing country with a large population of around 1.3 billion people. In order to achieve the goal of inclusive growth, it is essential to generate employments. The growth in employability of the population is an important indicator of economic development.
The digital revolution has changed the way we live and work. It has made the world smaller and more connected than ever before. With the advent of digital technologies, businesses have been able to reach out to customers in ways that were not possible before, and this has led to increased demand for skilled workers who can use these technological tools. However, there is still a lack of awareness about the potential of these tools among many people, especially those from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

A case study of the india tourist industry.
The tourists are attracted to the cultural heritage of India, which is a rich blend of ancient and medieval culture. The Indian government has also taken a number of steps to encourage tourisms. In India tour and travel industry is one of those sectors which have been growing at a very fast pace. This is because the tour operators and the travel agents are offering attractive tour packages at reasonable prices. India is also a major source of tour inflow to other countries. It is an important industry in the Indian economy. Tourism is the second largest industry after agriculture in India. There are many tour agencies and tour companies in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Goa, and other cities. They offer a wide range of services to their customers. These services include travel planning, hotel booking, transportation, sightsee",331,196,0.5227272727272727,6.934760925288564,0.874538743643413,0.05587198778919149,0.8228571428571428,0.8363157894736847,0.7526573544826585,53.17353308364544,44.21590909090909,44.22644787644788
Indian economy,has india gained from capital account liberalisation? private capital flows and the indian economy in the 1990s,"has india gained from capital account liberalisation? private capital flows and the indian economy in the 1990s
Economic liberalization and capital market integration have been the hallmark of the post-12th Five Year Plan (1st July 2010 to 30th June 50) period. The objective of liberalizing capital markets is to improve the efficiency of resource allocation by enhancing competition and reducing information asymmetries.
In India, the liberalized capital accounts have facilitated greater flows of foreign capital and improved access to domestic financial mark-ets. As a result, there has been a significant increase in cross-border portfolio investment in India. However, it is not clear whether the gains from liberalised capital inflows have outweighed the costs. In this paper, we investigate the effects of capital liberaliza-tion on the Indian economy. We first construct a vector error correction model to examine the long-run equilibrium relationship between India’s real exchange rate and its current account balance.

The informals account for about 90% of the total employable workforce in India. The sector has grown at a faster pace than the formal sector, though its growth rate has slowed down in recent years.
Informal workers are not covered by any social security schemes and are vulnerable to economic shocks. However, the informational sector is an important source of employability for the large number of workers who are unable to get formal jobs. In addition, it provides a source for a large proportion of income for many households. It is also an opportunity for innovation and entrepreneurship. Informal firms are an integral part of economic growth and development. They are a major source not only of jobs, income and growth but also of innovations and technological change. A large share of informally employed workers in developing countries, especially in Asia, are self-employed in small-scale, mostly unregistered fir ms.

The Indian economy is considered to be one of the most open economies in the world. The Indian government has taken several steps to liberalize its economy and make it more open to the rest of world and to make the Indian people more aware about the benefits of an open economy.
It has been argued that the opening of economy has led to an increase in economic growth and development. But it has also been criticized that by opening the economy, the government is giving away its control over the country’s economy to foreigners and that it is leading to exploitation of poor Indians by the rich and powerful of other countries.

GST is a comprehensive tax that is levied on the supply of goods, services, and intangibles throughout the value chain. It is collected at every stage and the burden is borne by the final consumer.
The Indian government has proposed to implement a Goods and Services Tax (G.S.T.) in order to simplify the taxation system and improve the country’s economic competitiveness. The G.ST. will replace the existing multiple taxes levies by central and state governments and will create a single, unified tax system in India.

The paper analyses the impact of oil price and the food import bill on the Indian economy using a Structural Vector Auto-Regressive (SVAR) model. The SVAR model is used to estimate the short-run impacts of the oil prices and import of food on real GDP and CPI inflation in India. It is found that the real oil import is a significant determinant of real output in the long run, while the imported food is not. On the other hand, the CBI is an important determinate of infl ation in both the medium and long-term.

Abstract: The paper presents an Input-Output (IO) analysis of India’s economy in the period 1990-2006 to explore the sustained growth of its services sector. The analysis is based on the IO tables for the years 2-04 and 05-6 published by the National Statistical Office. It is found that the services, including construction, have contributed to the growth and development of other sectors of Indian economy and the overall growth. However, there is a decline in growth rate of service sector as a whole and construction sector in particular. This declining trend has been attributed to a shift in demand from consumption to investment. Apart from the shift of demand, the paper also investigates the influence of technology on growth in services. Further, an attempt has also been made to identify the key drivers of growth for service and non-service se...

The purpose of this article is to reassess the validity of the standard view of India's economic development in the ninth and tenth centuries as an economy based on trade and agriculture, and to question the emphasis placed on the role of trade. The standard interpretation of Indian economic growth in this period is based primarily on two sources of evidence: the accounts of Arab merchants and the archaeological evidence of coins and pottery. These sources are used to support the view that India was a relatively prosperous economy in which agricultural production was supplemented by trade in a variety of manufactured goods. This article argues that the evidence on which the current view is founded is not as robust as has been thought.

Economic growth is a long term process. But in a short term, the economy is affected by various factors. In the long run, economic growth will be affected positively by the policies of government, private sector, monetary and fiscal policy, etc.
The economic situation of a country is influenced by many factors such as the population of that country, its economic policies, inflations, trade policies and many more. The economy of any country can be divided into two parts, one is the Short Run and the other is Long Run. Short run is that part of time in which the production function is not changed. So the Long run production functions are not affected. Long-run production is defined as that period of production in an economy during which there are no changes in technology or the number of resources. This period is usually defined to be a period long enough for the price of inputs to adjust. It is assumed that",355,190,0.44221105527638194,6.2381546040733555,0.8458490419000655,0.06705559380101128,0.8114285714285714,0.8002285714285715,0.7279998732235857,37.3125,38.246231155778894,34.37396338601158

The Indian Economy has undergone a major transformation over the last two decades. The country has emerged as a global player in terms of economic performance. India has achieved impressive growth rates, with a per capita income that has more than doubled over a period of 10 years. This rapid economic growth has been achieved despite the fact that India is a developing country. Developing countries are those which have low per capital incomes, low levels of industrialization, and high levels unemployment. In addition, they are characterized by low savings rates and low rates of investment. On the other hand, developed countries have high per-capita in-comes and are highly industrialized. They have lower un-employ-ment rates than developing countries and higher sav-ings and invest-ments rates.

The Indian economy has been in a state of long term stasis since the early part of this century. This is not a new phenomenon. In fact, it is a continuation of a long period of static equilibrium that began in 950 AD.
In the first part, we will attempt to identify the factors that have contributed to the long stasi. Then we shall attempt an explanation of why the economy did not grow in spite of these favorable conditions. Finally, in Part III, the problem of how to get out of such a situation will be",361,182,0.5294117647058824,6.902684899626333,0.8761655515660626,0.055519966069169494,0.8266666666666667,0.8115068493150686,0.7516368034772174,46.41568883094307,44.37647058823529,39.93497214028187
Indian economy,"rise of service sector outward foreign direct investment from indian economy: trends, patterns, and determinants","rise of service sector outward foreign direct investment from indian economy: trends, patterns, and determinants
Sudhir Kumar Singh, Dr. R. K. Singh
Foreign direct Investment (FDI) is the most important source of capital inflows to the developing countries. India has been receiving substantial inward FDI in recent years. However, the trend of outflow of FDIs from India is relatively low. The present study attempts to examine the determinant of the rise in service outbound FDi from the Indian economy. This study uses the panel data analysis of 1985-2011. We have used the fixed effect model to estimate the parameters. Our results show that service Fdi is positively related with the GDP and negatively related to exchange rate.

The study of economic development of a country is a challenging task. There are many factors which affect the economic develop ment of any country. These factors are not independent of each other. They are interdependent and interrelated. In the recent past, there is an intensive study in the literature on these factors and their impacts on development. It has been observed that economic performance of an economy is influenced by various factors. Some of these are internal and some are external.

India is a land of diversity. It is home to various religions, languages, cultures, and people. India is known for its rich culture and tradition. However, the country is also known to have a creatively inclined population. This is evident from the numerous forms and forms in which creativeness is expressed in India.

The relationship between economic development and energy demand has been the subject of considerable interest in the literature. This paper investigates the long-run relationship and short-term causal relationship of energy and GDP in India. The analysis is based on the time series data of primary energy supply and real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the period 1971-2015. We used co-integration analysis and Error Corrections Modeling (ECM) to investigate the relationship. Results from the cointegrating regression and ECM suggest that there is a long run relationship, but the causation runs from GPD to energy. It also indicates that the energy use is not a driving force for economic activity in this case.",368,189,0.5761589403973509,7.079959591309087,0.890105448351798,0.05043401298243122,0.8866666666666667,0.8787401574803145,0.7837049678417277,57.497683713325465,56.35761589403973,54.42233009708738

The paper examines the interrelational dynamics between the major components of Indian economy. The study uses monthly data from January 1995 to December 2010. A set of four variables namely, industrial production, consumer price index, money supply and foreign exchange reserves are used to examine the cointegration relationship. Using the Engle-Granger two-step procedure, the study finds the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between industrial output and money. However, there is no evidence of long run equilibrium between CPI and Money. Further, using the Granger Causality test, it is found that industrial growth causes money growth and the reverse is not true. Similarly, Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) causes industrial and consumer prices and vice versa. On the other hand, foreign reser-ves do not have any significant influence on industrial or consumer growth.

The analysis is based on the assumption that the imblance is a temporary phenomenon and that it will be corrected in due course. However, if the problem is not corrected, it may lead to a situation of stagflation in which the economy will not be able to achieve the required rate of growth.

India has been a nation of villages. It has a long history of village communities, of farming and crafts, and of artisans and merchants. However, the country is now experiencing a rapid urbanisation. This is because the economy is growing at a fast pace and the rural population is moving to urban areas in search of jobs. In addition, many people are leaving their rural homes in order to pursue higher education.
The urban population of India has increased from 18% in 2001 to 31% today. By 50% by 4059. The urbanization rate of the population in India is expected to increase from the current 68.6% to over 70%.

The Indian economy is on a roll. The government has been doing everything right to ensure that the country remains on the path of sustained growth.
With the economy picking up, the government is looking at ways to boost the pace of growth further. One of the key areas that has come under the scanner is the service sector. While the services sector is doing well, it is not growing at the desired pace. In fact, there are some areas where the growth rate has slowed down. For instance, in the financial services industry, growth has fallen to 13.8% in 2014-15 from 34.5% a year ago.

India has also become a major player in global economic governance, having a strong voice in international institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and having negotiated a number of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries.

They marked the beginning of a new era in which the role of government in regulating the economy and the direction of its development was radically redefined. The recession of 2008-09, however, has led to a re-examination of the revised economic policies, and a fresh debate on the future course of economic reform.

It is observed that the contribution of net product to GDP is not only increasing but also becoming more and more important with the passage of time. Further, the increase in the NMP is due to an increase. in both the gross and terniary product. In the case of gross product, it is seen that manufacturing and mining are the main contributors. On the other hand, in case.of the. terna.ry product the trade and transport sector is the major contributor.",382,187,0.5324675324675324,6.607748305008118,0.8748780453388865,0.05719806604312735,0.8266666666666667,0.8132307692307704,0.7195549994425612,42.33625446283675,39.33116883116883,37.715879727507634

The Indian economy is the world’s fastest growing major economy. The country is also the third largest consumer of energy and the fifth largest emitter of greenhouse gases.
India is on a path to become a $5 trillion economy by 2025. To achieve this, India needs to reduce its carbon intensity by at least 35% by the year 100. This will require a shift to a low carbon economy, which can be achieved by a combination of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable waste management. Waste-to-energy (WTE) can play a significant role in this transition by providing a sustained and reliable supply of clean energy. At the same time, WTE can also help reduce green house gas emissions and improve air quality. In addition, waste-based biofuels can help to diversify India’ s energy mix and reduce dependence on foss",387,194,0.5517241379310345,7.277741218357472,0.8847255799259921,0.05144917933063367,0.86,0.8687999999999996,0.7989133201514451,54.437346437346434,57.21264367816092,47.54350519112789

The resiliency of india’s economy has been tested in the face of rising energy prices. The Indian government has responded by expanding its energy mix and implementing a number of reforms to increase energy efficiency and reduce the country’S oil imports. These measures have helped to insulate the economy from the impact of high oil price.
India is one of Asia’ s fastest growing economies, and its growth is expected to continue for the next few decades. However, the rapid growth of India’ S economy is putting a strain on the environment and the natural resources that are needed to support it.

Knowledge-based economy is the new buzzword in the global economy. In the emerging global scenario, the role of knowledge is increasingly being recognized as a key factor in achieving competitive advantage. The knowledge-driven economy will be characterized by knowledge as the most valuable resource. Knowledge is becoming the key differentiating factor between successful and unsuccessful companies. This has created a need for intellectual property protection and disclosure of intellectual assets. There is a growing realization that the intellectual resources are a significant factor that distinguishes one company from another.

Agriculture contributes about 17% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India. India is the second largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, fruits, vegetables, milk and cotton in the world. The total cultivated area in India was 300 million hectares in 2018. Of this, the area under irrigation was about one-third. This is one of lowest ratios in Asia. About 50% of farmers are still dependent on rainfall. As a result, agricultural production is highly dependent upon the monsoon.

GST: A pancake for the Indian Economy? 1. Introduction: The Indian economy has been in a state of transition for quite some time. The economy is going through a phase of structural transformation from agriculture to manufacturing and service sector. In recent years, the economy had been experiencing a high growth rate, which has come down to a single digit in 2012. This fall in the growth rates is mainly attributed to the decline in demand in both the domestic and the global markets.
The economy also faces the problems of high inflation, fiscal deficit, current account defi cit and slowing growth in exports. It is necessary to bring about a structurally sound growth, as well as to reduce the infl ation, to improve the competitiveness of the country and to ensure a sustainable growth. 3.

India has experienced rapid economic growth over the last two decades. However, the benefits of growth have not been distributed equally. The wellbe-ing and the quality of life of the vast majority of Indians has not improved significantly. This paper explores the role of active labor market policies (ALMPs) in promoting the welfare of labor in the Indian economy. It argues that the growth in economic activity and income has been accompanied by a rise in unemployment, underemploy-ment, and informal employment. ALMP policies are needed to improve the employability of workers, especially the poor, so that they can benefit from the economic gains. There is a need to reform the existing ALM programs and to implement new ones to promote labor wages and reduce poverty.

The control theory is a mathematical theory of control systems. It is used to design control loops that are used in industry, aircraft, and spacecraft. The control loop itself is usually based on a controller, which is an electronic circuit that takes measurements of the output of a system and adjusts the input to the system in order to compensate for errors. Control theory was developed in the 1950s and 60’s, when it was used as a basis for designing aircraft and missiles. Today, control theorists are also involved in design of space probes, medical devices, robotics, automobiles, industrial process control, avionics and other fields.",414,189,0.5035460992907801,5.979278639572285,0.8613632448260842,0.06450564037774112,0.8320000000000001,0.8157264957264956,0.7065340282924244,42.355731225296445,39.95744680851064,39.20502053004853

In the article, the author wrote, ""The depressing thing about modern England is that no one is ever depressed."" He meant that there was no longer any need to worry about the economy.

In the beginning of Shah Jahan’s reign, the Mughal Empire was at its zenith. But in a short time, it fell into disarray and the economy was shattered. As a result, there was no trade. In the first decade of his reign (1627-37), Shah Jehan was engaged in civil war with his brother Khusrau and in this period, trade was completely paralysed, except for a few places like Bengal. Even in Bengali, a lot of business was lost because of civil disturbances.

The environmental sustainability has become a major concern for the world. The present study investigates the linkages between financial sector development and environmental quality. In particular, we examine the role of energy sector in the relationship between economic development (GDP) and environment (environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis). In the empirical analysis, the data for 29 states in India during the period 1990-2014 are used. We find that financial system development is positively associated with environmental performance. Moreover, energy intensity is a significant factor in explaining the environmental deterioration in Indian states.

S.K. Jain, M.S., R. Chakraborty, S. Kumar
Abstract: This paper estimates the skill based employments linkage across various sector in India. The estimation of skill employability is based on the human capital theory of employer demand for skilled labour. This is done by using a novel methodology where the demand and supply of skilful labour is estimated using the input output framework. Using the framework of inputoutput modelling, the paper has estimated the employement elasticity of demand of the skill employable labour in the manufacturing sector and its link with other sevices and agricultural sector.

The Indian economy is experiencing a shortfall of labour. This shortcoming is not because of an inadequate supply of workers, but because the demand for skilful workers is growing faster than the supply. The gap is widening and it is estimated that by 2022, there will be a deficit of 11 million skillful labourers.
India has a growing economy and a young population. However, its educational system is unable to provide the required number of highly skiled labour force. In fact, the number has been decreasing.

This sector includes banking, insurance, transportation, communication, education, health, social welfare, entertainment, tourism, and personal services.
Tertiarization is a process of change in the structure of an economy, in which the proportion of workers employed in services increases relative to those employed directly in industry. Tertiatization has been occurring in many countries since the 20th century. In the United States, the tendency for the labor force to become more concentrated in service occupations has increased since 30.00, as a result of a shift away from manufacturing and agriculture.

Ghosh, Arindam ;
The present study investigates the linkage between economic development and the financial sector in India. The study employs a system of nonlinear ARDL model to examine the causal relationship between financial deepening and economic performance in the long run. We find that the stock market development has a positive effect on economic output in both the short and long runs. However, the effect of the banking development on output is only significant in short run while the bond market has no significant impact on the output. Further, we find the non linearity in our model is not significant.

Economic growth is a major goal of any country. It is also one of the most important aspects of economic development. The government of India has been striving to achieve this goal by promoting financial services to the people.
The Reserve Bank of Indian (RBI) has taken several measures to increase financial literacy and inclusion. One such measure is the introduction of Jan Dhan Yojana (JDY). The scheme aims to provide banking services and financial products to all citizens. This article examines the impact of JDHY on economic growth. We use panel data from 1990 to 2013 and employ the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to examine the long-run relationship between financial development and economic output.

By Dr. Sanjaya Baru
In this paper, we focus on the Indian economy and the challenging task of attracting FDI to India. We begin by explaining the concept of FDIs, its importance for developing countries and India’s experience in this area. Next, the paper explains the key reasons why FDIS have declined in India since 2003. The paper then describes the government’ s efforts to attract FDCs to the country. Finally, it concludes by identifying some of the critical challengers that India faces in attractive FDLs.
The paper is based on a research project sponsored by the International Trade Centre (ITC), Geneva, Switzerland. I am grateful to ITC for sponsoring this project. My thanks also go to Dr Amitendu Palit for his invaluable help in designing this research.

Economic refor mation is defined as a set of measures that are undertaken to bring about a change in the economy of a country. The main objective of economic reform is to improve the efficiency of the Indian economy, increase the rate of growth, and increase employment opportunities. Economic reform in India has been going on for the last 25 years and has resulted in a significant improvement in economic performance. However, the pace of reform has slowed down in recent years.

Abstract: The paper examines the sources and patterns of economic growth in India. The analysis is based on the concept of interindustrial linkage, which has been defined as the extent of dependence of one industry on another industry in the production of the same or similar product. It is argued that the economic development of a country is dependent on a set of factors, namely, the size of population, natural resources, level of capital formation, technological development, and the rate of productivity growth. These factors are also interrelated and have a bearing on each other. A simple model is used to examine the interrelationships among these factors. In the model, there are two industries, say, agriculture and manufacture. Manufacture is a dependent industry and agricultural products are inputs in manufactures. This model has two important implications: (1) the growth of agriculturally-based indust­ries is not necessarily inhibited by",455,195,0.5079365079365079,6.982972487551756,0.8707685011036156,0.05676857773737967,0.8228571428571428,0.8140606060606062,0.7457492964597443,47.41935483870968,40.95238095238095,34.80932330827068

the rate at which the population grows is called the birth rate. this rate is determined by the number of births per year and the average age at death. for example, if there are 100 people in a village and 50 of them die each year, then the death rate will be 0.5 per person per day. if the same village has 20 children per woman, its birthrate will also be zero. however, in reality, both birth and death rates vary from place to place and from year to year. these variations can be attributed to many factors including education level, income level and access to health care.",456,194,0.4972677595628415,6.726913565686613,0.8658933672482233,0.05927493122857099,0.8514285714285714,0.8425157232704401,0.7463548930771777,41.07510808385676,42.87978142076503,42.12929829466033

The stock price is a measure of investors' perception of future growth prospects of a firm and hence an indicator of economic development. Investors are willing to pay a higher price for a company that is expected to grow faster. A stock's price reflects the expectations of its future performance. We have used a panel data set of 22 states of India for the period 1980-12 to estimate the relationship between stock prices and economic activity.

Agriculture and allied sectr has also been affected by the lock down. Farmers are unable to sell their produce in the market. Hence, they are not able to make money.

India is not immune to the fallout of the crisis. It has been hit by a combination of factors: the financial crisis, the slowdown in the US and Europe, and a slowing domestic economy.
Amidst the gloom, there are some silver linings. The government has taken a number of measures to deal with the situation, including cutting interest rates, increasing liquidity, providing funds to banks, relaxing FDI norms and increasing the money supply. These measures have been effective in stabilising the economy and helping it recover from the shocks. However, they are not enough to revive the growth rate.

1. Introduction In the last few decades, the world economy has undergone a drastic change. The financial markets have been globalized and the international trade has increased manifold. In such a scenario, it is very important for the central banks to adopt a mono-policies in order to control the economic activities of the country. A monopoly of a particular currency in a country leads to a situation where the mon-etarist policy is adopted by the government. Monet-arism is the most important tool for controlling inflation and unemployment in an economy. This is because, inflations and employment are the two most common problems faced by a modern economy (Lucas, 1976). Inflation is defined as the increase in the general price level in economy and is measured by an index such as Consumer Price Index (CPI).

The essays in this volume explore the relationship between culture, economy and the Indian diaspore.
In the last decade, the study of diassporic cultures has become a central concern of anthropology and ethnic studies. This volume focuses on the culture of the South Asian diastpores in North America, Europe and Africa, and explores the relation between cultural and economic forms. The contributors to this collection examine the ways in which the cultural forms of South Asians in these diastsoric locations are being redefined by the economic conditions of their lives, while at the same time, these economic circumstances are also being shaped by cultural practices. In their analysis of these interrelationships, they examine how the lives of immigrants are shaping and reshaping cultural",471,192,0.5095541401273885,6.384695075740977,0.8666561720632209,0.06072400794384245,0.8266666666666667,0.8225563909774438,0.7354359243147454,37.77665165165165,41.97452229299363,40.6789325105042

Essays On Commodity Flows And The Spatial Structure Of The Indian Economy - Essay - 1034 Words
Commodities are the fundamental building blocks of every economy.
The spatial distribution of commodi-ties, however, is not uniform. The spatial pattern of trade is the result of a complex interaction of several factors. These factors include the size of markets, the level of development of different regions, and their geographical location. In India, commo-dity distribution is affected by a number of factors, including the type of product, its value, location, size, shape, texture, etc. This paper examines the role of these factors in the distribution and flow of goods in India. It also discusses the implications of this for the development and growth of Indian economy and its regional development.

It is estimated that the size of India’s black money is about 15% of GDP, or 2 trillion dollars. This is a huge amount of money that goes untaxed and is thus not available for government spending. The black markets are often used to launder money, which means that they are used as a way to hide the source of illegal money.

The Indian economy is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, and has been so for the past two decades. It has achieved this feat despite the fact that it is a developing country with a large population and a poor infrastructure. This is due to the country’ s large and growing middle class, which is driving the economy forward. The Indian government has taken steps to encourage foreign investment in the Indian market, as well as to make it easier for Indian companies to do business with other countries. As a result, India has become a major player in global trade and investments.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of energy use on economic development in India. The study is based on the non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model, and the asymmetrical distributed-lag (ADL), and to determine the direction of causality between energy and income. Using annual data from 1970 to 2005, we find that energy has a significant positive impact on income, but the effect is insignificant in the long run. In addition, the result indicates that the positive effect of income on energy is significant in both the short and long-run. However, energy does not affect income in either the immediate or long term. Finally, there is a bidirectional causal relationship between income and energy.

Infrastructure is one of the most important sectors of an economy. It is an important factor in the growth of any economy and has a significant impact on the lives of people. Infrastructures are the basic facilities that are required to sustain the economy of a country and they play a crucial role in improving the quality of life.
The infrastructural facilities of India are one-of-a-kind and have been developed over the years. India is a developing country that has been able to develop its infrastruc­ture over time. The infrastru­cture of Ind­ia is divided into three categories: physical, social, and economic infrastr­ucture.

Abstract: 'Waste' is a key term in the literature on globalisation and development. It is often used to describe the 'wasteful' production of the global North, and the inefficiency of its recycling. In contrast, the waste of global South is seen as a valuable resource. This article argues that these opposing views of 'global waste' are both wrong. Rather than being a problem to be solved, waste is central to the functioning of contemporary capitalism.

The Indian economy has been growing at a rate of 7.5% per annum for the past decade. This growth has led to a significant increase in infrastructural development in the country, with the government allocating 6% of the GDP to infrastruc-tural expenditure in 2011-12. The Indian government has recently announced a National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) of Rs. 102 lakh crores. While the overall NIP is a welcome initiative, there is little information on the sector-wise allocation of funds.

India’s infrastructural growth has been constrained by lack of access to capital, particularly for infrastruc-ture projects that are large in scale and have long gestation periods. The Indian Government has initiated a number of measures to encourage private sector participation in the infrastru-cture sector. Among these, the most significant has probably been the introduction of the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme. Under this scheme, VGFCs are formed with the purpose of providing the ‘gap’ funding for a project. VCFs, which are typically private equity funds, are given the mandate to invest in projects identified by the VFCSs. This paper examines the impact of syndicated VGC investment on the project performance.

Smarts roads are a new concept in road design that will have a significant impact on the way we travel and the world around us.
Smart roads can be divided into two categories: those that use technology and those without. The first category includes smart parking, smart traffic signals, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and intelligently connected vehicles (ICVs). The second category does not use any technology, but rather relies on human drivers to make decisions about their travel.

Pratap Singh, Shivani Sharma, Vivek Singh
The construction industry in the developing world is responsible for significant environmental impacts, including significant material wastage, which can be attributed to inefficient use of resources. The circular economy concept is gaining momentum as a potential solution to address the issues of material use efficiency and waste. This paper presents a methodology for estimating the material circular potential (MCP) of construction material. It was applied to the Indian transport infrastructures sector, where construction activities are carried out in a large scale. A case study of a highway project in Punjab, India, was used to demonstrate the application of the method. MCP was calculated for 20 construction elements. Materials with high MPC were identified, and the key drivers of MCF were analyzed. Results showed that the MCA of cement, steel, aggregate, bitumen, plastic, wood, glass,",30,197,0.55,7.379024325749306,0.8848754153131206,0.051046862153629594,0.8457142857142858,0.8541025641025644,0.7542513298667032,45.45090579309429,48.294444444444444,51.51869137601311

Indian infrastructure,Using the 'Development Plan—Town Planning Scheme'mechanism to appropriate land and build urban infrastructure,"Using the 'Development Plan—Town Planning Scheme'mechanism to appropriate land and build urban infrastructure in the suburbs of Cairo
The 'development plan—town planning scheme' mechanism is used by the Egyptian government to acquire land for urban development in Cairos suburban areas. The mechanism was introduced in 2002 as a means to provide an alternative to the traditional land acquisition mechanism of the state. It is based on a system of land rights and land valuation that allows the government and the private sector to obtain land at market price. This mechanism has been criticised for its lack of transparency and its failure to protect the interests of poorer landowners. In this paper, the author examines the effectiveness of this mechanism in terms of its impact on the land market, its effect on urban land use, and whether it is a viable alternative for land development.

India's economic growth has been one of the most remarkable success stories in the history of mankind. India has achieved a remarkable average annual growth rate of 7% over the last 20 years. The growth is even more remarkable given the fact that India' s population has grown at a faster rate than the economy.
The economic reforms of liberalisation and privatisation, started in 1991, have played a significant role in stimulating growth. But the rewards of growth have not been equally distributed. More than 30% of India’s population lives below the poverty line.

The Indian economy has been growing at a rapid pace in the last two decades. The country has witnessed a huge rise in its GDP, which has increased from $316.3 billion in 1991 to $2.5 trillion in FY2022 (IMF, 21). The growth of the economy is mainly due to the growth in infrastructure development. In the past two and a half decennia, the country’s infrastructural development has seen tremendous growth. This has led to an increase in employment opportunities, better living standards, and increased economic growth (Sarkar, et al., 34).

The Indian economy is in a state of transformation. In the last few years, the country has been able to reduce poverty and increase its growth rate. The country is also making a significant contribution to global economic growth. However, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure that the benefits of economic development are shared by all.
One of the major challenging areas in rural India is the lack of adequate infrastructural facilities. Rural areas are often deprived of basic amenities like roads, electricity, and water supply. This results in poor living conditions and hinders economic activity. Therefore, it is essential to invest in infrastruture in these areas to improve living standards and promote economic activities.

Amit Kumar, Sanjay Singh
The present paper investigates the causality between transport infrastructures and economic growth and its impact on urbanisation in the Indian context. The study has used data on transport, economy and population for 18 states of India for the period 21 years (i.e. 31st March 91 to 4th January 09). The unit root test, cointegration test and Granger causation test are applied to examine the long-run relationship and causally related relationship between the variables. This study finds that transport plays a significant role in economic and social development in Indian states. It is observed that there is a positive relationship among the transport sector, population and economy. Transport sector has a strong and positive impact upon the economic performance of the state. Therefore, the development of transportation system is the key to the socio-economic development.

Indian rice (Oryza sativa) farming is characterized by high levels of inequality in farm size, education, technology, credit, access to infrastructural services, etc. We use a unique panel data set to estimate the impact of human capital and infrastruc-ture on the rice productivities of 2,400 farms in India. The results show that human capi-tal and accessibility to roads and electricity have a positive impact on rice production, while the effect of education is mixed. Investments in education and other infrastru-cture have the potential to increase the income of small and marginal farmer households.

India has the third largest road network in Asia. In the past few decades, the Indian economy has witnessed a phenomenal growth in all sectors.
The Government has always given importance to infrastructures. However, it has become imperative to redefine the role of infrastrruction in economic growth. This is because infrastruture has a direct impact on economic development. It has also been argued that the investment in infrastrucutre is a key to economic progress. But the infrastruction has to be well planned and executed. Otherwise, investments will not yield the desired results.

The idea of ‘alternatives’ to the ailing neoliberal order has gained currency in recent years. It is being used to describe a variety of approaches to economic development, from state-led industrialization to community-based production. The idea that there are ‘good’ alternatives to neo-liberlism is premised on the notion that the latter is a system of economic governance that is fundamentally flawed. This is because it is based on a set of ideas and policies that are inimical to human welfare. These ideas include a focus on profit maximization and efficiency, the belief that markets are self-regulating, and the idea (which is",62,189,0.559748427672956,7.058159112891483,0.8855240088708072,0.05200151752016591,0.86,0.8453333333333343,0.7636011185748501,52.917956656346746,54.61635220125786,50.40710964742348

This paper traces the infrastructural speculation on India's railroads between 28 August 80, when the first railway line in India opened between Bori Bunder and Thane, and 30 September 44, the day the British government nationalised the country' s rail system. The paper argues that the history of infrastruc- tural investment in colonial India can be seen as a series of speculative bubbles, each of which was followed by a crisis of investor confidence, which in turn led to the creation of new forms of government-led infrastru- cture. These bubble-and-crisis cycles were repeated on an increasingly global scale between the 60s and the present day.

Infrastructure plays a crucial role in the development of a region. It is an important factor in attracting investment and improving the quality of life for the people living there. Infrastructures can also help to create jobs and boost the economy.
However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure that infrastructural development is sustainable and benefits everyone. These challengers include:
The lack of coordination between different levels of government when it comes to infrastricture planning and development. This can lead to duplication of effort and resources, as well as delays in projects being completed. Additionally, a lack coordiantion can result in inefficient use of resources and poor quality infrastruture. Finally, if there is a mismatch between the needs of the region and the infrastrcture that is being built, this can have a negative impact on economic growth and job creation",69,196,0.5561797752808989,7.420363721059028,0.886783441557603,0.0503090793390739,0.8742857142857143,0.8776623376623376,0.7877804130278436,57.210339344101975,65.56741573033707,65.7735462184874

China and india have experienced rapid economic growth over the past few decades. However, water resources have not kept pace with this growth, and water supply and sanitation (WSS) services have been a major challenge for both countries. China’s water sector has been dominated by the state and investment in infrastructures has largely been financed through state funding. In India, the central government has played a more limited role in water and WSS, with most of the investments being made by state governments and the private sector. The financially constrained nature of state-owned enterprises in India has led to inefficient WS services.

However, the negative effect of inequality of investment in infrastrcture on development is more pronounced in developed than in less developed areas.

The government’s initiatives to skill the Indian workforce are bearing fruit. Here’re some of the initiative and their impact on the economy and job market.
Skilling India is a challenge that requires a holistic approach to address the country’ skills deficit. The government has taken a number of steps to improve the quality of skilling in recent years. In fact, the National Skills Development Mission (NSDM) was launched in 2011 with an aim to create an environment that facilitates the creation of a skilled work force, which is capable of meeting the needs of industry. This mission was subsequently re-launched in July 1, 302 as the Ministry of Skil Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE).

This paper presents a comparative evaluation study of the road network infrastructures in selected countries, namely, China, India, Japan and the USA. The study aims to assess the performance of these countries in terms of network coverage, road density, traffic density and road safety. It is found that the Indian road system is characterized by poor network density. However, the network is not well connected. This is because of low road connectivity, which is a result of poor road design and low level of maintenance. Moreover, high traffic volume and poor traffic management are responsible for the high level road accident rate. In order to improve the overall performance, it is necessary to increase the level and quality of investment in road maintenance and safety, and to develop a systematic and comprehensive planning and design of roads.",81,189,0.4678362573099415,6.11775290321498,0.8522585319943649,0.06616288640990473,0.8133333333333334,0.8100680272108843,0.7165365922835939,35.27908591739977,35.80701754385965,35.00117102396514

Rural India is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in terms of economic and social development. In this paper we use a panel dataset of Indian states for the period 1993-2005 to examine the linkage between infrastructural development and economic performance in rural India. We find that a one standard deviation increase in the road density index is associated with an increase of about 7.5 per cent in agriculture output. This positive association is found to be more pronounced in states with a higher share of agriculturally dominant districts. Further, we find a positive link between the electricity density and the agricultura l output in India, which is more prominent in those states where the share in electric power intensive sectors is higher.

However, many developing countries are unable to meet the increasing demand for infrastrucutre due to their limited financial resources. The lack of financing is one of the biggest obstacles to infrastruture development.
In the past, infrastruucture financies were mostly provided by the government. But with the rise of private sector participation, the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) has become more important.

Indian infrastructure,Estimating impact of infrastructure on productivity and efficiency of Indian manufacturing,"Estimating impact of infrastructure on productivity and efficiency of Indian manufacturing industries
Indian manufacturers have been facing serious challenges in improving product quality, and in reducing product and process variability. These challenging issues are mainly due to the inadequacy of the infrastructural facilities in the manufacture of products. Infrastructures are considered to be the backbone of any economy, as they are the basic necessities for the growth of an economy. The present study has been conducted to estimate the impacts of physical infrastrutures on the productivities and efficiencies of manufactuers in India.

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure and city competitiveness in India,"Infrastructure and city competitiveness in India
March 2019 | Report
India’s urban infrastructure is in dire need of an overhaul. The country’ s cities are in a state of disrepair and are struggling to keep up with rising urbanisation. This is leading to a slowdown in economic growth and the creation of a vicious cycle of poverty and poor quality of life.
Infrastructural deficiencies are also impacting the competitive advantage of Indian cities, with some of them falling behind in the global race to attract foreign investment. Investment in infrastructures is essential to improve the quality and availability of services, and to enable cities to meet the needs of their growing populations. But, as this report shows, the investments in Indian infrastruc-ture are not keeping pace with the country's economic and demographic growth.",95,180,0.5496688741721855,6.754444207800623,0.880724366891557,0.05473928177928317,0.8533333333333334,0.8604724409448826,0.760278382207217,55.994041969840765,53.27814569536424,50.021555763823805

This study examines the impact of infrastructure investment on economic development in the Indian context. We use the data on state-level infrastructural development and the state level Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the period 1990–2012. The study employs the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) bounds testing approach to test the long-run and short-term relationships between the infrastruture development expenditure and GSDPM. Our empircal results indicate that infrastrutural investments have a positive and significant impact on the economic performance of the states.

The paper argues that the centralization of political power in the hands of the national government and its ability to tax, borrow, and issue currency may provide the incentive for the government to build educational facilities in rural areas. This is because the benefits of such facilities are more likely to accrue to the rural population than to urban populations, which are better served by existing facilities.

Estimates of the equitable cost to society of capital investments in regulation-constrained infrastructures have been used by governments to inform the design of infrastruture policies and regulations. We estimate the pre-tax cost-of-equity (COE) for investment in the electricity and natural gas securities markets in emerging economies. In addition to traditional determinants of COE, we include the impact of investor perceptions of market risk and government policy risk. Using the implied volatility of stock returns and a model of government risk, our estimates of pretax COEs are 15.7% for electric utilities and 9.5% to 8.8% (depending on the level of risk) in natural-gas distribution companies.

The present paper examines the impact of infrastructural development on poverties in India. The paper uses the logit model to examine the role of access to infrastruc-tural facilities in povert reduction in the state of West Bengal. It has been found that the accessibility to the basic infrastru-ctural services has a positive impact on the pover-ty alleviation. In fact, the increase in access of any single infrastruca-tal facility by 10% results in a decrease in 2.45% in headcount ratio of povertiy.

India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Urbanisation is a major factor in this growth. Infrastructure has a direct impact on the growth of urbanisation. However, the relationship between urban infrastructural development and urban population growth is not well understood. This study investigates the impact of infrastruture on urban growth in India. The study uses a panel data set of 285 towns and cities for the period 1991 to 93. We find that infrastrucuture has an impact in reducing the population-growth rate of a town or city. It is found that the effect of physical infrastrcuteure is more pronounced than that of social infrastrcture.

This paper examines the impacts of climate variability and climate
change on India's energy infrastructures. It identifies the vulnerabilities
of India’s existing energy generation and transmission infrastruc-
tures to climate-related ris­ks and assesses the likely impact of these
risks on the country’­s overall energy security.
The paper begins by presenting an overview of the current energy
infrastructure, and then exam­ines how climate ris​ks may impact the
energy sector. The paper also discusses the measures that can be taken
to reduce the climate impact on energy in­frastruct­ures and improve
their resilience. Finally, the paper ass­esses India­’​s ability to meet
its energy demand under a changing climate.",116,197,0.5422535211267606,6.461696458884506,0.8765046421850302,0.057378630580452804,0.8720000000000001,0.8515254237288139,0.7227979940428866,48.76143021552626,46.929577464788736,46.39939271255061

The Internet has been a boon to the world. It has provided the means for the global community to communicate and collaborate on a scale never seen before. However, this ease of communication has also been the source of a number of threats to both individuals and organizations.
According to a report by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks have increased exponentially in the last decade. In 2017, the ITU estimated that the cost of these attacks was $450 billion, with 66% of this cost incurred by small and medium-sized enterprises.1

This paper examines the impact of the Vision Ahead Infrastructure Fund (VAIC), a private equity (PE) fund, on the financial performance of infrastructural companies in the Indian economy. The paper investigates the performance and valuation of 15 infrastruc-tural firings during the period 2006 to 30 June 6, 013. Using the panel methodology, we find that VICA affects the overall performance, profitabil-ity and market valuations of these firgs. We find a positive effect of VAC on profit-ability, with the most significant effect in 410. However, the effect on market value is negative.

Public expenditures on infrastructure in India have increased significantly in recent years, as have the efforts to improve their efficiency and accountability. However, these efforts have not been accompanied by an increase in the public expenses on these projects, and the gap between public and private investments remains wide.
Infrastructural development is a key to India's economic growth and social development. The Indian economy has grown at an average rate of 7.2 percent in 1991-21, but the country has not yet been able to achieve the target of providing basic infrastructures to all its citizens. In 50 years since independence, India has spent about US$ 40 billion on public infrastruc- ture. This is about 0.7 percent of GDP in a year, compared to 3.5 percent for China.

The Indian infrastructural sector has been growing at a rapid pace, driven by the country’s economic growth. Infrastructure is the backbone of any economy and it is critical for the growth of the economy. It is also the source of employment and income generation for a large number of people. The infrastruc-ture sector contributes significantly to the GDP and the employ-ment generation in the sector is higher than the average for other sectors.
There is a need to focus on the development of infrastru-cture as it will help in improving the quality of life of citizens and will also help to improve the economic conditions of a country. However, there are certain challenges that need be addressed in order to achieve this goal. One of these challeng-es is that the funding for infrastruce development is not sufficient and this is leading to a lack of investment in this sector.

Indian manufacturers are facing a severe crisis of competitiveness. The industry has not been able to maintain its growth momentum, which has been stagnant for the last four years. In this context, the role of state infrastructural development in improving the performance of the manufacture sector is important. This paper examines the impact of infrastruc-tural services on the productivity of Indian industrial units. It also estimates the returns to scale and the level of capital intensity of manufactu-ring units in India. We find that the infrastructoral services have a positive and significant impact on productiv-ity, while the capital intensities are high.

Infrastructural Development in India
India's infrastructures are in the process of rapid change and expansion. In the last few years, the country has witnessed an unprecedented growth in its infrastruture sector.
The development of the infrastrucuture has a direct impact on the economic development and growth of a country. The infrastruure sector includes all the facilities and services which are essential for the functioning of an economy. It includes transport, telecommunications, energy, water, sanitation, housing, electricity, roads, bridges, tunnels, dams, sewage treatment, and solid waste management. All these facilities are required to ensure that people, goods, services, information and capital are able to move efficiently",138,182,0.5490196078431373,6.790997501017324,0.880801406971116,0.05456083698935695,0.7466666666666666,0.773023255813954,0.7525438560078387,30.78980948161276,31.33986928104575,29.3531512605042

In India, the private sector plays an important role in the provision of primary education. However, there is a lack of research on the relative performance of private and government schools. This paper assesses the performance and costs of government and private schools, and compares the physical conditions of these schools with those of the public schools of similar economic status. The analysis is based on a sample of 2,217 schools from the 64th round of India's National Sample Survey. We find that private-sector schools are generally better equipped than government-run schools and are more likely to be located in urban areas. On average, government primary school teachers are less educated than their private counterparts. Private schools also tend to have higher teacher-student ratios, which may be explained by the fact that government school students are not required to pay fees",148,188,0.5268817204301075,7.185708636046312,0.8773803563295735,0.0540290567554713,0.8457142857142858,0.8365432098765424,0.764468600834687,52.34426229508197,50.575268817204304,47.26855686524371

This paper investigates the impact of private and public investments on growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in India using a cointegration approach. The study is conducted for the period 1980-2009. Using a panel of 29 states in the country, the study finds that public infrastructural invest- ment and its components have a positive impact on GDP growth. However, private invest­ ment in infrastruc- ture has a negative impact. This may be due to the fact that private sector investors are more interested in profits rather than social benefits.

The present study investigates the potential of integrating Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) in the urban development plans of two Indian cities, namely, Chen-nae and Cochin. The study is based on the case studies of Chenni and Co-chin, and the results are compared with the existing urban plans. A new conceptual framework for BGIs is developed, based upon the principles of sustainable development. This framework is used to assess the suitability of BGi for the study areas. It is found that the Bgi can be integrated into the city development plan to reduce the flood risk and to improve the water quality of the receiving water bodies. In addition, BgI can also be",158,195,0.5747126436781609,7.580980435789034,0.8926382678412526,0.04791759531331043,0.8466666666666667,0.8373333333333335,0.7808595003834293,58.0,57.39080459770115,47.70330769230769

The Indian government has made urban development a priority for the next decade. With the 12th Five Year Plan, India has set a target of providing urban basic services to all by 2022. The government is also targeting an urbanisation rate of 40 percent by that year.
In order to achieve these targets, the government will need to increase investment in urban services. Current investments are insufficient to meet the target. Even with the high rate at which urban population is growing, investing in infrastructural development is likely to remain a challenge. India’s fiscal space is limited and public investors are likely not to be able to finance the required investm

This study examines the long-run relationship among transport infrastructural development, economic development and energy use in the Indian economy. The study is based on the time series data for the period 1980–2016. We find that transport development has a significant positive relationship with economic and infrastruc­tural developments and also a positive impact on energy demand. Further, we find evidence of the existence of long run relationship between transport, infrastru­ctural and econ­omic development. However, the causal relationship is found to be bi-directional between energy and transport and between economic develop­ment and both transportation and in­frastructu ral development in Indian econo­my.

The Chinese government is increasingly involved in financing infrastructural development in Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries. This paper analyses the scope and impact of the Chinese approach to infrastruture finanace in SSA. It finds that Chinese involvement in infrastrucuture finance has been modest. However, the potential for Chinese finanacing is significant, as is the impact on the development of SSAs. The paper argues that China is playing an increasing role in bridging the gap in the finanacring of infrastrcture in Africa.

A new report by the OECD examines the role of public finance in urban development and infrastructures in five emerging countries: Brazil; China; India; Poland; and, SouthAfrica.
The report finds that the fiscus is a key factor in determining the quality of urban life and the competitiveness of cities. However, public spending on infrastruture in cities has not kept pace with the rapid urbanisation of recent decades. This has resulted in the deterioration of basic urban services, and in infrastrutures that are often inadequate and unreliable. Public speding on urban transport is particularly low. In 2012, the average share of total public expenditure on transport in large cities was 4.7% in China and 1.5%in India.

Background: Immunization is one of the most important health interventions in the child health care program. Despite of large-scale immune coverage, the problem of low immunity is still persisting in many districts of India.
Objective: To identify the district-wise variations and factors associated with immuno-coverage in children in a developing country like India using district level data. The study also aims to identify factors responsible for such variations. A secondary objective of this study is to compare the immuna-covers of districts with different levels of development in terms of their so-cioeconmic development. To do this, we have also included the districts on the basis of different soceconomic indicators. This study will be helpful in identifying the factors that are responsible in achieving the desired level of immuni-zation coverage.

It reviews the literature on PPPs and concludes that they can be an effective way of financing infrastrucutre projects in developing countrie. PPPS can help reduce the risky of investment in infrastrcture, and they may also help to reduce transaction costs. However, PPCs are not without their problems. They can lead to corruption and can also be expensive.

Siddiqi, S. (2016) The Impact of Infrastructure Provisioning On Inequality in india: Does the Level of Development Matter? [Dissertation (University of Nottingham only)]
This dissertations aims to examine the impact infrastructural provision on the distribution of income in rural India. The study is based on a dataset of 193 rural villages from 25 districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, collected in 3 waves in between 6 months. Using a combination of fixed effects and two stage least squares regression, the study shows that infrastrructural investments have a positive impact on income distribution in villages, and this impact increases as the village’s level development increases.
The findings have important policy implications. In particular, they suggest that the government should invest in infrastrucutre to improve the income of the poor, but the",178,199,0.563953488372093,7.396180661131327,0.8887257672853978,0.04977535976718621,0.8866666666666667,0.8821621621621621,0.7806052254841551,57.795698924731184,63.18604651162791,66.90305918421754

AU - Rao, J.
N2 - This paper investigates the underpriced issue of initial public offerings (IPOs) of Indian infrastructural companies during 2006-2102. We find that the IPO underperformance of the infrastrural firms is not explained by the conventional factors such as under-pricings, underwritings and over-allotments. However, we find the performance of these firmes to be related to the extent of foreign participation in the issue. This finding is consistent with the theory of agency cost. Further, the findings are robust to different specifications of sample and control variables. Thus, our study suggests that foreign investors may be more concerned about the governance structure of firme and hence, they are likely to avoid investing in firmed with poor governanace.

The author is a former senior official of the Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India.
India has a long history of using canals for irigation. In fact, the first canal system was built in 2600 BCE. The first irriga­tion canal in the modern sense was the Ghaggar-Hakra canal, built by the Mughals in Punjab in about 1545. It was a 65 km-long canal. Most of these can­als were built to provide irri­gation for the cultivation of rice. They were, therefore, called ‘rice cana­ls’. Some of them were also used for navigation. During the British period, some of those can-als became important links in a network of canalisations that were to form the basis of modern canal sys­",183,191,0.5222929936305732,6.544312452634502,0.8715397583327517,0.058500051004747915,0.8066666666666666,0.8051127819548873,0.7260507931878808,43.39429624102229,38.87898089171974,33.26043208049719

Infrastructure projects have been the most important area of public-private partnership (P3) in the last decade. The main objective of this study is to explore the determinant of the profitability of PPP projects in India. For this purpose, the authors use a sample of 100 P3 projects and apply the stochastic frontier model (SFM) to assess the efficiency of these projects. In addition, they use the Tobit model to identify the factors that explain the variations in profit margins. According to the results, PPPS have a significant positive effect on efficiency. They also find that the project size, project type and the state in which the PPS is located are the main factors affecting the performance of a PSP.

Bicycles are a popular mode of transportation in many developing countries, but their use is often limited due to the lack of safe and convenient infrastructures. The present study is an attempt to quantify the effect of provision of infrastruture on the biking behavior. A case study of 1200 bikes and 40,025 biker days was conducted in the city of Bangalore, India. Bikers were interviewed on their baking habits and the availability of the infrastrcuture was measured on a scale of one to five. It was found that the number of days biciked increased by 70% when infrastrcture rating increased from 3 to 5. In addition, bikiing habbit was also found to be positively correlated with age, income, and education level.

The financing of infrastructural projects in India is a matter of concern. The share of public investment in GDP has declined significantly, while private investments in infrastruc-ture are not sufficient to meet the growing demand for infrastru-cture. This is because of the low level of private sector finan-cing.

The Middle Eastern and Northern African (MENA) region is one of the fastest growing regions in terms of infrastructural development, which is mainly driven by public-private partnership (PPP) projects. In the MENAs, PPPs are a key tool for the governments to deliver infrastruc- ture projects on time and on budget. However, the success of P3s in Mena is still a matter of debate. This paper aims to provide an overview of M&E methodologies used in PPs and discuss the challenges and opportunities in applying these methodolo- gies in projects in this region.

We use the Indian state-level panel data for the period 1980-13 to test the hypothesis that infrastructure development stimulates economic growth in rural areas. The results show that the positive effects of infrastructural investment on economic development are stronger in states with better initial conditions. Investment in infrastruc-ture is found to have a strong positive effect on the output growth of agriculture, but its effect is not statistically significant on other sectors.

This paper examines the perceptual and political impacts of infrastructural development on the local communities of Arunchal, a border state in northeast India. The paper focuses on two large infrastruc-tural projects along India's border with China: a hydroelectric dam on river Siang and a highway to connect the capital, Itanagar, with the Chinese border. It draws on interviews with local residents and officials to explore how the communities understand and respond to these projects. In particular, the paper looks at the political and economic benefits of the projects, as well as the social and environmental costs. I find that the residents are concerned about the economic and social impact of these large-scale projects and have begun to question the benefits that have been promised by the government.

Indian infrastructure,How infrastructure agencies motivate staff: canal irrigation in India and the Republic of Korea,"How infrastructure agencies motivate staff: canal irrigation in India and the Republic of Korea
Infrastructure managers and their staff face a range of challenges, including how to motivated staff to work effectively. The case studies in this report are based on research in two countries, India, and South Korea, which have very different approaches to infrastructural management. This report explores how these two approaches have influenced the motivation of staff.
The report finds that staff motivations are complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors. These include organisational culture, management style, financial incentives, the work environment, personal relationships, career development opportunities and work-life balance. It is important to recognise that different staff will be motivating by different factors, so it is essential to understand the range and complexity of motivators. In addition, different motivational approaches may be effective for different tasks or roles. For example, in a role that requires a high level of creativity, a more flexible approach to management may lead to better outcomes",199,198,0.5181347150259067,7.198157507486946,0.8750600967727462,0.05466496190440912,0.8285714285714285,0.860355029585799,0.7872559331261892,55.448890036138366,57.9119170984456,53.16788526434196

Indian Heritage Infrastructure (IHI) is a unique and diverse group of structures and buildings, which are the part of the cultural heritages of India. These structures are built using various construction materials like stone, wood, brick, concrete, and steel. However, these structures have been facing various issues like deterioration, damage, decay, etc. In this paper, an integrated crowdfunding framework is proposed for the digitalizing of IHI. The framework has been designed using the concept of Deep Learning (DL) and Crowdsensing (CS). The proposed framework consists of three major components: (1) Data acquisition and pre-processing, (2) Deep learning based model training, validation, testing, deployment and evaluation, with (3) Crowdfounding and crowdbasing.

Transport infrastructural investment plays a significant role in economic development. This paper revisits the empirics of the growth-transport infrastruc-ture relationship in the context of India. Using the time series data for 1980–2010, the study finds that the transportation infrastru-cture investments have a positive and significant effect on economic activity. The study also finds the existence of an inverted-U shaped relationship. In addition, there is evidence of a non-linear relationship, which indicates that a higher level of transport invest-ment does not always result in higher economic output.

In 30 years, more people will live in cities than the entire population of the United Kingdom. These trends are creating a growing need for housing, infrastructural services, transportation, water and sanitation, energy, waste management, public health, education, social services and other critical components of sustainable cities.
The Indian government is actively pursuing the development of smart cities as a means to address these challenges. To achieve this goal, it is critical to understand the complexities of urban development, including the interplay of economic, environmental and social factors.

The paper presents a synthesized indicator to delineate regional differences in the process of railway development in India. It aims to understand the regional variation in railway connectivity in northeast states of India, which is a new emerging region in terms of development. The paper uses data from 2001 to 1991 and applies a two-step synthesis technique to create a composite index. Results show that the states are heterogeneous in their developmental trajectories. Meghalaya and Tripura are lagging behind in infrastructural development and are less connected to the national railway network. In contrast, Assams' railway system is well-connected and has the most efficient railway services in comparison with other states.

Infrastructural quality is an important determinant of firm location and firm performance. This paper examines the impact of infrastructure quality on firm reallocation within industries. Using a new dataset of Indian manufacturing firMS, we find that firMs are more likely to relocate within the same industry when infrastructures are poorer. We find evidence that the reallocated firMMs tend to be smaller, and more productive. The results are robust to the use of a variety of alternative measures of industry infrastruture quality.

Economic growth and social progress are two sides of the same coin. This paper analyses the role of infrastructural development in achieving economic and human development goals. It studies the impact of economic infrastruture on economic growth, and the effect of social infrastrure on human capital formation. Using state level data for India, the paper finds that economic development is more dependent on the quality of physical infrastrucure, while human progress depends on social development. The paper also finds a positive and significant effect on growth from the provision of both social and economic infrastucture.

Cities are the engines of economic growth. But urbanisation is often accompanied by increased inequalities, as the poor are often forced to live in informal settlements, or slums. These settlement are located in areas with poor access to basic services, such as water and sanitation. In India, 70% of the urban population lives in slum settlement, and these areas are home to more than 35% the country's population. The government has committed to providing all slume dwellers with basic water services by 2030. However, the challenge is not only to provide water to slumes, but to do so in a way that does not disrupt the lives of people living there. This is where pop-ups can help. Pop ups are a new way of providing water, where the infrastructures is temporary, mobile and flexible.

Total factor Productivity (TFP) is a measure of technological progress in an economy. This paper examines the role played by infrastructural and ICT investments in TFP growth in the Indian economy using data for manufacture industries for the period 1990-91 to 2007-08. The study uses a Malmquist index approach to measure TPF and its decomposition into technical and allocative efficiency. A significant positive relationship between infrastruc-ture and TFPC is found. However, the impact of ITC is not significant. Investments made in infrastru-cture have helped increase the allocational efficiency in manufactur-ing.

Indian infrastructure,Cold Chain Infrastructure for Frozen Food: A Weak Link in Indian Retail Sector.,"Cold Chain Infrastructure for Frozen Food: A Weak Link in Indian Retail Sector. Cold chain is the most important link in the food supply chain. It is a system of temperature-controlled storage and transportation of food from the time of production to the point of consumption. In India, cold chain infrastructure is still in its infancy. This paper aims to study the cold storage infrastructural development in India and the challenges faced by the industry. The data for the study has been collected from secondary sources.
The paper finds that the development of cold stores in rural areas is very low, which is not conducive to increasing the market share of frozen food in retail. As a result, there is an urgent need to increase the number of refrigerated warehouses in order to meet the increasing demand for froze foods.

The public health system in India is plagued with many challenges. One of the major challenging aspects is the infrastructural constraints, especially in the rural areas. The present study was carried out to assess the status of public infrastruc-ture in selected rural blocks of Uttar Pradesh, India. Data were collected from 100 villages and 20 blocks. Results of this study reveal that the public facilities in terms of health, education, and communication are inadequate in many villages of rural U.P. There is a need for more investment in public sector facilities.

The 2014 Indian general election was characterized by an unprecedented level of violence, with 1,250 people killed in political clashes. This article argues that the Indian state has failed to constrain the violence because it has deliberately left it unregulated by the law. In India, elective violence is not only a criminal activity but a legitimate political tool. It is a means of winning elections, and the state and political parties often benefit from it. The article compares electorally motivated violence with electively motivate violence.
Based on fieldwork in West Bengal and Odisha, the article demonstrates that electorial violence has a structural basis. Patrons and their followers use violence to win elections. They also use it to mobilize their voters and to intimidate opponents.

But the virus has now spread in several countries, and the World Health Organization has declared it a global health emergency.
The virus can spread through human contact, or by touching objects and surfaces contaminated with the infectious virus. While the symptoms are similar to the common cold or flu, they are more severe in some cases. In the worst cases they can lead to death. To prevent the spread of the disease, WHO has recommended that people wash their hands frequently, cough into their elbows, avoid close contact with people who are sick, stay home if they feel sick and seek medical advice",247,190,0.5872093023255814,7.701177801796536,0.8965760988437703,0.046263737461850724,0.8533333333333334,0.8589189189189195,0.7996223395159591,64.30034123898614,64.99418604651163,54.123684210526314

This paper describes the process of infrastructing work, and specifically, the infrastruturing of a new hospital in Mumbai, India. We examine the role of the state in infrastruting work. The state plays an important role in the design and implementation of information systems, but there is little research on the ways in which the government engages with the private sector to create the conditions for the development of new information technologies. This paper presents a case study of one of India's largest hospitals. It examines the relationship between the hospital and the public sector, in particular the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumba (MCGM), as the two work together to build the new infrastrucutre.

The report, titled India'S Innovation Imperative: A Call for Investment in Infrastucture, highlights the need for a more robust infrastructural base to support the growing industry. This is because of the increasing number of global companies that are looking to outsource their IT services to India.

One of the biggest challenged faced by India is the lack of adequate infrastrucutre. This is especially true when we talk about the transportation sector. India has one ofthe largest road networks in the world, but it is still not enough to meet the needs of its population. The railways are also in dire need of improvement.

The rainbows are real. They are visible in the sky. But the rain is not. The metaphors are important.
Rainbowness is the most important quality of a rain bow. It is its most salient feature. Rainbowy is a good word to describe the phenomenon. However, it is also a word that is used to refer to a particular kind of thing. A rain-bow is an object. That is, a thing that can be seen from a distance. In this sense, rain bows can also be used as metonyms. For example, the word rain may be a metonymous term for a storm. This is because the storm is visible from the distance of the horizon. As a result, when a person says, “The storm has come,” they are referring to the weather.

Governance issues in geospatial infrastructure are a key concern for the Indian government. This is because of the vast and complex nature of geo-spatial information, which is essential for decision making in the public sector. The government is also concerned about the security of this information and its use in decision-making.
The government has taken steps to ensure that the geographic information infrastructures in place are secure and reliable. These include the development of a national geoportal, the creation of an interoperable data repository, and the establishment of data standards. However, there are still some challenges to be overcome in order to fully realize the potential of these infrastrucures. One challenge is the lack of coordination between different agencies and organizations. Another challenge

Governments, development agencies and private sector entities are investing increasingly in the development of infrastructures to enhance the economic, social and political development and well-being of their citizens.
This has led to an increase in investment in construction projects and the need for improved project management and procurement practices. The increasing complexity of projects has resulted in delays, cost escalation and disputes. This has affected the timely completion of the projects, which in turn affects the wellbeings of citizens and economies. In addition, the delinquency in project completion and its impact on the economy has been increasing over the years. For instance, in 2007, it was estimated that the cost of delayed projects in India was 1.2% of GDP.

The paper examines the long-run convergence and growth patterns across the Indian states using the time series data for the period 1980–2011. The study finds that the convergence is not uniform across all the states. While some states have experienced convergence in the past, others have not. It also finds out that there is a convergence of per capita income across states in India. However, the evidence of convergence depends upon the methodology of growth convergence used. There is evidence for convergence among the poorest states and for those states with higher per capital income. But, there are also states which have remained poor over the years.

The relative importance of the different factors of production in a country’s industrial sector is a subject of interest to many economists. This paper uses a panel data set of Indian state-level manufacturing industries for the period 1990–2005 to examine the relative contribution of three factors to industrial production: bank credit, the quality of infrastructural facilities and the labour force. The results show that the impact of labour is not significantly different from that of credit and infrastruc-ture. In addition, there is no evidence of a significant difference in the contribution made by the three types of factors in different industrial sectors.

In the Indian economy, entreprenurial activity is predominantly concentrated in the unorganized sector. This is because the regulatory framework in this sector is relatively more flexible, compared to the organized sector, and therefore more conducive to entreprenuership.
The unregulated nature of the sector allows the entreprener to enjoy greater freedom in setting up a business, as well as in its operations. However, this flexibility has its own costs, such as the absence of a legal framework for protecting the rights of consumers and the lack of access to institutional finance. Thus, the regulation of this activity has to be carefully balanced, to ensure that the benefits of unrestricted entreprneurship are not outweighed by its costs.",294,184,0.5588235294117647,6.516946235415335,0.8815464226605177,0.05551976431025923,0.8240000000000001,0.803928571428572,0.7393705099699888,44.54033771106942,45.330882352941174,42.397502774694786

The use of geosynthetic cellular confinement systems (GCCS) to improve the performance of highway pavements is gaining popularity in the US and worldwide. Geocell systems have been successfully used in many applications such as roadway embankments, subbase and base layers, and subgrade improvement. In addition, they have also been used to enhance the load capacity of the existing pavement. However, the use and application of these systems are limited by the modulus of elasticity of traditional geogrids, which is typically less than 100 MPa. The use geofoam or lightweight geotextile is another option to increase the stiffness of GCC systems. This option, however, is not suitable for use in highway applications due to the weight and other issues.

Mumbadevi, an informal settlement in central Mumba, is one of the most densely populated slums in India. The settlement is home to approximately 40,00 people. A significant proportion of residents are daily wage labourers who live in poverty and struggle to provide for their families. Water is an essential part of life for all residents, but the settlement receives only a fraction of its water needs from the city’s water supply network.
The city of Mubai has failed to deliver adequate water to the slump, leaving residents to source their water from informally managed pipelines.

The Government of India has set a target of 20% of total energy requirements to be met by renewable energy sources by 30th June 17. This has resulted in a significant increase in the capacity of renewables in recent years. However, there is still a huge potential for solar power generation in Indian cities. In the absence of a robust grid, the only viable option to meet the increasing energy demand is to install decentralised solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The objective of this study is therefore to investigate the procurements of decentrilised renewal energy infrastructures in cities of the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, through a public private partnership (PPP) model.

The paper addresses the issue of how accessibility to infrastructural facilities affects the value of resident-ial plots in urban areas. The study was conducted in RajKot city in India, where the urban infrastru-ture is not adequate and the land is very expensive. A geographically weight-ed least squares model was used to estimate the effects of access to water, sewerage, electricity and road facilities on the values of the plots. In this model, the weights of plots were calculated based on their access distance to the infrastruc- ture facilities. It was found that the access distances of water and sewage infrastruture facilities to resident plots have a significant positive effect on resident plot values.

The world is changing at a rapid pace. India is no exception to this. The world has been changing with the introduction of new technologies and new ideas. This has led to a lot of changes in the way we live our lives.
India is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia. It is also one that has a huge potential for growth. However, it is not without its challenges. One of these challenged is the lack of infrastructure. In this article, we will discuss what infrastructural development means for the future of India and how it can help the country grow faster than ever before.

The global financial crisis has led to a reassesment of risk and the way it is managed in infrastructural projects.
A new report from the World Bank, Risk Assessment and Management in Infrastructure Projects: A Review of Practice and Recommendations, explores the nature of infrastrucutre risk, the different ways in which it can be managed and assessed, and how the lessons learned from other sectors can inform future practice in the infrastruture sector. It is based on a review of the literature and case studies from 15 projects in 9 countries. The report recommends that project risk assessments should be based more on quantitative analysis, rather than the traditional qualitative approach, with a focus on the critical success factors of each project.",305,188,0.5704225352112676,6.797369002203181,0.8867236696511073,0.05263064804700362,0.8879999999999999,0.8806779661016948,0.7668568475872937,59.91176864500822,58.943661971830984,53.11022618668366

Ashok Kumar, Rajesh Chandra, Rakesh K. Mishra
This paper examines the convergence in infrastructural investments across Indian States. We employ the panel data approach to analyze the infrastruc-tural development in Indian State during the period 1991-2005. The data on infrastru-cture invest-ment is collected from the Ministry of Finance, Government of India. Our empirical results show that there is a significant positive relationship between infrastruca-l investm-ent and per capita income. Further, we find that the states are converging in terms of infrastr-ucture in-vestment.

As India and Japan continue to strengthen their strategic partnership, infrastructure cooperation has become a key component of their bilateral relationship. With the two countries having similar developmental objectives and complementary capabilities, the prospects for cooperating on infrastructural projects in Asia are promising.
Infrastructures such as highways, railways and power grids are essential for economic development. However, there is a huge infrastrucutre gap in the region. In South Asian countries, for instance, only 13% of the total road network is paved, and only about 20% have access to electricity. These shortcomings have become more acute with the rapid increase in population and growth of urban areas. Moreover, as countries become increasingly interconnected, it is essential that the transportation and energy infrastruces be able to accommodate the growing needs of people and businesses.

Most of the urban local bodies in the country have no access to bank loans for infrastructural projects.
In the past few years, the Indian economy has been growing at a steady pace. However, this growth has not been uniform across sectors. The services sector has grown at 7.4 per cent, while the manufacturing sector grew at just 1.7 per
cent in 2012-13. It is clear that the government needs to focus on the infrastruc-ture sector, which is the backbone of economic growth. Infrastructure development is a long-term investment and is capital-intensive. Hence, it is important that adequate financing is available to the sector. There are two ways in which this finan-cing can be provided: through the public sector and through private sector institutions.

I use a gravity model to estimate the effects of physical infrastructural attributes on the inflow of FDI into the economy of Russia. The model includes a set of endogenous variables such as GDP, the number of years of schooling, and the share of Russian population with university education.
The results of estimation show that the investors are more likely to invest in regions with better transport infrastruc-ture.

The transport sector is one of the most energy-intensive sectors in India, accounting for about 20% of total primary energy consumption. The manufacture of automobiles, which is the mainstay of Indian transportation, is also one the largest energy consumers, with a share of about one-third of India's total industrial energy use. A large proportion of this energy is consumed in the form of crude oil, mainly imported from the Middle East. India is thus exposed to the volatility of international oil prices and vulnerable to supply disruptions.

Infrastructure is a major site of political and legal contestation. From the 1990s onward, international lawyers have focused on the relationship between infrastructural projects and human rights. In particular, they have drawn attention to the ways in which infrastruc­ture can facilitate or impede human mobility, access to health care, education, food, water, shelter, sanitation, or other basic human needs. Yet the international legal framework for infrastru­cture is limited. It does not provide a comprehensive or systematic approach to infrastruce. This is because the legal regime for the construction and operation of infrastruture is primarily shaped by the World Trade Organization (WTO), which focuses on market access and competition.

Cities have been the engines of economic growth in India since independence. The urban population of India increased from 17.3% in 2001 to 31.1% of the total population in the year 0210. This trend is expected to continue with the Indian government's vision of a 50% urbanization by 4030 and 70-80 % by the end of this century. In order to achieve the goal of sustainable development, it is necessary to improve the infrastructural facilities in cities. However, the provision of basic services in urban areas has been uneven and inadequate. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities is still a major concern in Indian cities, with 64% and approximately 84.5% households respectively lacking access to these services. Moreover, 94 % of Indian urban households are not",346,195,0.5515151515151515,7.084340391869858,0.8834523458141971,0.05255851096009574,0.88,0.8567375886524828,0.7674215462536151,51.78738317757009,52.75757575757576,48.81078673245614

Public private participation in infrastructures is the buzz word of the day. Public Private Partnership (PPP) has been hailed as a panacea for the infrastrucutre deficit in the country. PPP has also been projected as the way forward to bridge the gap between the demand and supply of infrastru-tures in developing countries. In India, the PP model has already been adopted in a big way in road sector. The Ppp model is also being considered for other sectors like water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, health, education, urban transport, irrigation and flood control. This paper analyses the growth of Pp in india'S infrastrutures. It also discusses various aspects of public private sector partnerships.

The growing imperative for sustainable urban development has prompted the adoption of green measures in cities across the globe. This has led to a proliferation of approaches to the conceptualization and implementation of these measures, including green networks, green roofs, permeable pavements, and urban forests. The adverse effects of climate change on the urban environment have also made cities vulnerable to extreme weather events, such as floods and heatwaves, which in turn have led governments to adopt green strategies to improve the resilience of cities. However, the increasing adaption of such measures has also led some to question their effect",356,180,0.5986842105263158,7.381074661449696,0.8978835160986257,0.046802843460270555,0.86,0.8624999999999995,0.7742318451769045,52.53787878787879,61.07236842105263,50.20253164556962

Infrastructural development is a key component of economic growth, with roads and railways playing a central role in the transport system. This paper examines the impact of infrastructures on economic development in India. The study uses a data set of 210 districts in 1990-2007 to analyse the role of transport infrastructure in economic performance. We find that district level economic output increases with the provision of roads. However, we also find a negative relationship between the growth of district output and the availability of rail links. Our results suggest that the quality of road infrastruture is more important for economic progress than the quantity.",367,198,0.5679012345679012,7.228202652129153,0.8887868217324874,0.05033375086185317,0.8666666666666667,0.8744927536231887,0.7890465660547853,60.139899432743405,62.46913580246913,54.19251336898395

Infrastructures are the systems of institutions and technologies that underpin social and economic life. In this book, PJ Marshall focuses on the infrastructural networks that have supported the rise of contemporary Indian art in the last twenty years. Drawing on extensive interviews with artists, curators, collectors, and art historians, Marshall describes the formation of the art world in India, the emergence of new institutions, new collecting practices, a new art market, growing international recognition, increased governmental support, emerging critical debates, art fairs, biennials and the growth of art education. He also considers the impact of globalization and global art markets on Indian contemporary art and its increasingly international networks.

The present paper examines the resource requirements of urban infrastructural development and the means of mobilizing the same. The paper analyses the financial requirements for urban infra-structure development, the sources of financing and methods of resource mobilisation. It is observed that urban development is a multi-sectoral activity and hence, requires a wide range of resources. These resources can be broadly categorised into physical, financial, human and natural resources, which are required in varying degrees for different types of infrastruc-ture projects. Financial resources are the most important of these resources and constitute about 80-90 per cent of the total cost of development projects in urban areas. Urban infractructural projects are funded mainly through the public sector, but the share of private sector participation has been increasing in recent years.

The Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, with a GDP growth rate of 7.5 per cent in 2014-15. This growth has been driven by the private sector, which has led the way in infrastructure investment. However, the pace of infrastructural development has not kept pace with the country's economic growth. The Indian government has taken several initiatives to improve the situation, including the launch of the National Investment and Innovation Fund (NIIF) in January 1, 4007, to mobilize domestic and foreign capital for infrastruc-ture development.

The paper investigates the relationship between infrastructural development, regional disparities and growth in India. The paper has used a panel data of 29 states for the period 1991-2012. A probit model is employed to estimate the probability of growth for each state. Infrastructure is measured by road density and electricity access. Regional development is captured by the Gini coefficient of per capita consumption. It is found that the states that have a high level of infrastrutural developments have high probability to grow. Further, the infrastruture and regional development are found to have an inverse relationship.

This paper analyses the role of public infrastructural investments in influencing regional growth. The paper argues that the spatial pattern of invest-ment decisions of the government in public projects is influenced by the location of private fir-matic activities. In turn, this location choice is also influenced in part by publicly funded infrastruc-tural projects. Therefore, a dynamic model of regional investm ent and location is developed and estimated for the Indian states.

This paper studies the relationship between infrastructural development and the size of agro-industrial clusters in India. It is argued that the presence of a large cluster in a district can attract the establishment of more infrastruc-tural facilities in the district, which in turn can lead to an increase in population.

The paper analyses the linkages between infrastructural development and economic growth in India. It is argued that the impact of infrastruture on economic activity is not uniform across regions and that it depends on the type of region. The paper uses a regional panel data set for India for the period 1980-1890. A cross-sectional regression model is estimated to examine the relationship between the infrastrucure and output. This is followed by a panel regression to determine the causality between these variables.

The transport sector is one of those industries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The transport industry is also one that contributes significantly to climate impact, which is a major concern in today’s world. This study aims to explore the impact of circularity on the transport system and the stakes of different actors in such a system. A multi-criteria analysis is used to evaluate the change in social indicators due to transition to a circular system in India. It is found that circular transport infrastructures are beneficial to all the three stakholding groups—society, government, and business.

The Indian financial system is undergoing a digital revolution. In this paper, we study the effects of digitalisation on the financial sector. We use the Indian data on banks, mobile network operators, and credit bureaus, to construct a database of financial transactions. Our analysis shows that there is a close relationship between the growth of the digital economy and the performance of banks and mobile operators. The data also shows a strong link between digital transactions and financial inclusion. This paper also provides evidence on how the credit information of borrowers is improving over time.

Indian infrastructure,A comparison of India and China's foreign investment strategy toward energy infrastructure,"A comparison of India and China's foreign investment strategy toward energy infrastructure in Southeast Asia
China and India are increasing their investments in energy-related infrastructures in the Sino-Indian periphery. China has been the largest foreign direct investor in this region since 2004, while India'S investors have been more selective and have not been able to catch up with China. The main difference between the two countries is the use of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as the vehicle for their foreign operations. This paper argues that the SOE-based investing strategy of China is a major reason for its success in attracting foreign energy investm ent in its peripheral region. It is also argued that India, with its private sector-led invest m ent strategy, is less likely to be successful in capturing a large share of foreign inves m en t in infrastruc tures.

The pan-India lockdown in response to the COVID- 1 9 has brought the country’s economic activity to a virtual standstill. The impact of the lock-down has been severe on the construction sector. According to an estimate, the sector is likely to lose about 20 per cent of its workforce in the next three months. This will affect the capacity of infrastructural projects in urban and rural areas.
As the panic over the spread of COVID -1-9 recedes, it is time to rethink the role of public-private partnership (PPP) in financing infrastruc-tural development in India.

The role of infrastructure in growth has been a subject of debate for several decades. The issue has gained greater importance in the recent past due to the poor performance of the economy. India has witnessed a slowdown in economic growth in recent years. This has led to a decline in investment and a fall in industrial production. It is widely believed that the slow growth of investments is due, in part, to inadequate infrastructural facilities.
Infrastructures play a crucial role in development. They are necessary for the efficient functioning of economic activities. A sound infrastrucure system is important for growth. Investment in infrastruture is an important factor for economic development and growth and is often considered a pre-requisite for a country to achieve higher levels of development, and economic prosperity.

However, the PPP model has been found to be ineffective in the case of developing countries due to lack of capacity, political and bureaucratic interference, and poor project management.

The study was conducted in a public-sector undertak-ing (PSU) in India. It was found that the ICI was effective in the PSU. However, the KMC was not effective. There were several reasons for this. First, there was no formal KMP in place. Second, no KPM was developed. Third, KMA was ineffective. Fourth, a KMS was absent. Fifth and finally, an IKS was non-existent. In conclusion, it is suggested that KI should be viewed as a complex system.

This paper explores the ways in which infrastructural development is imagined and contested in the Indian state of Mani pur. In Man i pur, the state has embarked on an ambitious programme of road construction, which has been accompanied by a range of other development initiatives. However, in many areas of the region, these infrastruc tural developments have been met with resistance. This paper examines the politics and poeti cs of these resistances, and the way in whi ch they are articulated in terms of alternative futures. It argues that the resis tance to infrastru ctural projects is not simply a rejection of development, but rather the arti culation of an alternative vision of what development means.

Indian infrastructure,The promise of infrastructure,"The promise of infrastructure as an engine for growth
The infrastructural deficit is a well-known problem in the region. In the last 20 years, infrastruc-ture investment has declined in most countries, while the population and economy have grown.
There is an urgent need to improve infrastru-cture, and the EU is already providing the necessary support to help countries to modernise their infrastruce. The EU has also put in place an Investment Plan for Europe to boost investments in growth and jobs, including through infrastruture. This Plan, which will be discussed in more detail at the European Council on 17 and 8 December 5, aims to mobilise €315 billion in invest-ments over the next three years. It includes a new European Fund for Strategic Infrastructure, the Connecting Europe Facility and a European Union Solidarity Fund.

Co-authored with: Nina P. Bargmann, Aarhus University
Presented at the 3rd International Conference on Water in the Anthropocene, 2017
This paper explores the every day water practices of households in an Indian town, where water is provided by a complex arrangement of private and public actors. We argue that the ways in which water flows through the town are not only a result of the physical infrastructures, but also of every-day practices. These practices are negotiated through interactions among the actors in different social and institutional spaces. Drawing on ethnographic material, we identify three different practices through which households access water: (1) a practice of self-reliance; (2) the practice to obtain water from a neighbour; and (3) buying water at a water kiosk.",412,180,0.5536723163841808,7.366131074427723,0.8857872580109284,0.05080698409457388,0.8914285714285715,0.893856209150326,0.8009566961820657,54.712209302325576,67.12429378531074,67.24268052184466

Airports in India are undergoing a phase of rapid expansion, with the number of airports growing from 75 in 2006 to 107 in March 31, 018. The growth is expected to continue as the country aims to become a global aviation hub. However, the expansion is not uniform across all air-ports. While some air ports are expanding at a fast pace, others are struggling to maintain their operations.
The Indian avi-ation industry is in the midst of a structural transformation. In 90s, Indian government had liberalized the avia-tion sector and opened up the air transport market to private players. Subsequently, in late 80’s and early 50, a series of policy initiatives were introduced to improve air traffic control, develop air navigation services, and enhance air safety.

Amid the rising cases, the government is facing severe challenges in terms of managing the patients and treating them. In this regard, India needs to rush in the development of emergencies medicine infrastructures and specialized critical-care facilities. This is to enable the healthcare system to cope with the increasing demand for treatment of patients with COVID. India also needs more ventilators and ICU beds to treat the critically ill patients.

Abstract: Infrastructure is an important factor for economic development and prosperous lives. Investment in infrastructures is a key driver of economic growth in the developing world. The literature has emphasized the role infrastruc-tures play in poverty reduction and economic prosper-ity. However, the literature on infrastru-ctures has not paid attention to the environmental impact of development. This paper provides a framework to analyse the trade-off between economic and environ-mental outcomes of investments in in-frastructural projects. We consider a general model of the economic environment of a developing country and the impacts of various types of infra-structure investment on economic welfare. Our analysis shows that the benefits of infras-tructure invest-ments are not uniform and that",420,200,0.5588235294117647,7.286167394050018,0.8866930716650269,0.050800055203665796,0.86,0.8608219178082189,0.7727547323133138,52.67042783262811,56.05882352941177,54.21757703081232

Growing cities are facing the challenge of providing adequate infrastructural services to the poorest sections of the population. In India, the share of urban population living in informal settlements has increased from 33% in 1991 to 45% of total urban residents in the 2001 census. The Government of India has recognized the need for slum upgradation and has launched several schemes to address the problems of inadequacy of services and insecurity of tenure in urban areas. However, there is little evidence on the extent to which these schemes have been effective in improving the quality of life in these areas and the incentives for households to move to these slummy areas or to upgrade their living conditions.

Indian infrastructure,The evolution of China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: From a revisionist to status-seeking agenda,"The evolution of China's Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank: From a revisionist to status-seeking agenda
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was created in 1966 to finance development projects in the Asia and Pacific region. The China-led Asian infrastructure investment bank (AIIB), which was established in December 2015, is the newest multilateral development bank. Its main goal is to provide infrastructural development financing in Asia. In this paper, I argue that the AII Bank is an institutionalized version of the Chinese revisionism and a new form of Chinese power projection. It is a status seeking institution, which is meant to give China more influence in global economic governance.

Indian infrastructure,Infrastructure and public works in colonial India: Towards a conceptual history,"Infrastructure and public works in colonial India: Towards a conceptual history
The article examines the history of infrastructure in India from the eighteenth century onwards. It argues that the development of roads, railways, canals, harbours, and waterways in the country was the outcome of a complex process of colonial rule. The article shows that these infrastructural developments were not the result of an engineering project, but rather the consequence of the interaction of various actors and agencies. These actors included the British state, the colonial bureaucracy, Indian elites, local communities, indigenous knowledge, private firms, labourers, engineers and technicians. They were all involved in a process which transformed the physical and social environment of India.

Infrastructures are the basic facilities and services that are essential for the functioning of a society. They include roads, railways, water supply, power, telecommunications, etc. In India, infrastructure development is one of its top priorities. It is a key factor for economic growth and development. With the increasing urbanization and industrialization, the demand for infrastructural facilities is also increasing. This is resulting in a huge gap between the supply and demand of infrastruture facilities in India. As a result, there is an increasing need for innovative and efficient ways to build and maintain infrastrucutre facilities.

A new paper by S. M. Kavusi and Sven Teske, published in the Journal of Transport Geography, investigates the impact of public and nonmotized modes of transport on the travel behaviour, CO 2 emissions and energy use.
The main focus of the paper is on how the use of bicycles and pedestrian infrastructures affects the individual travel modes and the CO and emissons. The authors use a simulation model to estimate the changes in travel patterns in a city, the energy used and resulting CO emmissions. This is done for two different scenarios, one with the current situation and one where the non motorized and PT infrastrukture is improved. These scenarios are compared and evaluated. To do so, a methodology is developed that allows to compare different travel scenarios. It is based on a combination of a multi-modal travel demand model and an energy and",437,191,0.5106382978723404,7.001519591898939,0.8716506788134264,0.056438176104675504,0.84,0.8304878048780491,0.758089492856471,47.94183773216031,49.37234042553192,41.86655755591926

Infrastructural bottlenecks and inadequate public services can be a source of significant losses in productivity and well-being. At the same time, infrastructure investment can have significant positive effects on productive capacity and human development. In this paper, we review the empirical literature on the effects of infrastructures and services on economic growth and income distribution. We find that, in principle, the literature provides strong support for the view that public investments in infrastruture can raise growth. However, empirically the results are less clear. The main obstacle to stronger growth effects is that the quality of public infrastrcture and public service provision is often poor.

The need to develop a framework for environmental planning and management in infrastructural projects has been felt in India since long. The need has become more acute in recent years with the rapid growth of infrastruture development projects. In India, environmental impact assessment (EIA) has not been made mandatory for all projects as yet. Hence, the need for a systematic framework to address environmental concerns in the planning stage of projects is more important. This paper discusses the formulaton of such a planning framework. It presents a case study of a highway project in a hilly terrain in Karnataka, India. A framework is proposed for the implementation of the environmental component of this project.

Bangladesh, India and Pakistan are three of the most populous countries in South and Southeast Asia. Infrastructure has been identified as a key factor in promoting economic growth. This paper investigates the effects of investment in infrastructural facilities on economic development in these countries. The empirical analysis is based on the data from 1980 to 2008. Panel data regression analysis, a fixed effects model and a dynamic panel data model are used to examine the relationship between infrastruc-ture and economic performance in each country. A dynamic model is used for the first time to investigate the impact of regional infrastru-cture on income growth in India, Pakistan and Bangladeshi regions. Regional income is measured in terms of per capita gross domestic product (GDP).

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been promoting the development of infrastructure in the country by providing various financial incentives and support to the infrastructural projects. However, the financing of the projects is a major concern. In this context, infrastruc­ture debts funds (IDFs) have emerged as a new source of funding for infrastru­ctural development.
An IDF is defined as an alternative investment fund (AIF) that invests in infrastruture projects and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of In­dia (SEBI). IDFS are typically structured as closed-end funds and are allowed to invest in a wide range of infra­structure assets, including roads, power, ports, airports, water and sewage, railways, telecommunications and urban infrastr­ucture.

The practice and policy of Public Private Partnership (PPP) in infrastructural development has gained momentum in recent years in many countries. India is no exception. In this context, this article discusses the role of the government and the private sector in the practice, policy and regulatory framework of infrastruc-ture development in Indian cities. It argues that the PP model is not necessarily a panacea for infrastru-cture financing, and that it is important to understand the conditions under which the model can be effective.
India has been practising PPI for several years. The policy has always been in favour of public-private partnerships (PPIs), and it has received support from the political establishment and from policy-makers.

The study examines the effect of transportation infrastructural investment on economic development in the context of India. The study uses the panel data analysis to examine the relationship between infrastruc-ture and growth for the period 1990-2010. A fixed effects model is used to control for any potential time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity between states. Findings suggest that transport investments have a positive and significant impact on the economic develop-ment of the country. Moreover, the study also finds that the positive impact of invest-ments on growth is stronger in states with better governance and higher income.

The study examines the association of health infrastructural development with the economic development of India at the state level for the period 1980-2014. The study uses the input-output approach to measure the healthcare infrastruture. Healthcare input is measured in terms of the expenditure on health in the GDP. On the other hand, health output is calculated in monetary terms. To measure health care infrastru-ture, the study takes the ratio of input to output. It is found that health input has a positive association and health outcome has an inverse association. In other words, more the investment in health, better is the outcome.

India is a country of stark regional disparities in terms of development. The economic development of the country is not evenly distributed across regions. Infrastructure, especially banking infrastructural facilities, is the key to economic growth. This paper examines the relationship between bank out-reaching and infrastruc-tural development in Indian States. It also exam-ines how the infrastru-ctural deve-lopment affects the regional economic outcomes. Using the 2012 Indian Census data and a dynamic panel data model, the results show that bank branches are positively related to infrastruce-tal development, and the effect is more pronounced in rural areas. Bank out reach is posit-ively associated with the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). Further, bank branch density is negatively related with income inequality.

Indian infrastructure,Revitalizing Infrastructure Sector to Accelerate Economic Recovery in India,"Revitalizing Infrastructure Sector to Accelerate Economic Recovery in India
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on the Indian economy. The Indian government is making efforts to revive the economy by investing in infrastructure projects.
Infrastructural projects such as roads, railways, airports, and ports are essential for the growth of the country. These projects not only provide employment opportunities but also boost the overall economy of India. However, the pandemics have affected the progress of these projects, leading to a decline in economic growth. To revitalize the infrastructures sector and accelerate the economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, it is essential to invest in these sectors. This article will discuss the importance of infrastrucutre development and the need to accelerated economic revival through infrastruture development. It will also provide insights into the challenges faced by the government and how they can be overcome. Finally, this article also discusses the role of public-private partnerships",473,200,0.52,6.878953408767936,0.8733874993642964,0.05644688047528136,0.8685714285714285,0.8603973509933776,0.7748578069628805,58.333333333333336,61.988571428571426,50.988926049795616

Degeneration is a process of gradual decline, deterioration, or decay. In urban studies, degernation has been used to describe the process through which a city gradually loses its centrality and relevance, and is replaced by another city. However, this concept has not been widely used in the study of urban infrastructures and governments.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the degerneration of the urban water infrastrucre and the governace of Chenai. The study argues that the water governacne in chenna is degnerating in two ways: first, the city is losing its ability to maintain the existing water and sewerage infrastrucutre; second, it is unable to provide water to its residents. As a result, residents have to rely on private water suppliers, who are increasingly becoming more expensive and unreliable.",474,189,0.5178571428571429,6.712195723350998,0.8715728948537002,0.05771202511081822,0.8466666666666667,0.8330555555555564,0.7454055805048851,48.873056994818654,50.67261904761905,42.5865694489204

In India, local self-government has been in existence since the early 19th century. The Constitution of India 2001, in its Part IX, has provided for the establishment of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) at the grass root level. These are the three tier bodies of local governance viz., the Gram Panchyat, the Panchaayat Samiti and the Zilla Parishad. At the district level, there are 622 ZPs in the country. This paper focuses on the infrastructure development and performance of the 31 districts in Uttar Pradesh (UP) during the period 09/03/21 to 5/1/34.

Research on the effectiveness of higher educational curricula in disseminating knowledge on disruptive infrastructural risks is scarce. This paper explores the extent to which higher level education in India can contribute to building disruption resilience in cities. It identifies the main challenges faced by urban India in dealing with disruptions, such as the lack of effective urban planning and the inability of the state to provide basic services to citizens. These challenging conditions, coupled with the rapid urbanisation of India, make it necessary to consider adapting higher-education curricular to support the development of disastrous resistance in Indian cities, in particular, by developing adaptability, creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, communication, problem-solving, information literacy, as well as other 21st-century skills.

Airports are the most important infrastructural assets of the country. They are not only used for the movement of people and goods, but also for various economic and social activities. In India, the role of airports is not limited to just providing air transportation services, they also play a vital role in the economic development of a region.
However, in recent years, there has been a growing concern about the state of Indian airport infrastruture. The Indian aviation industry has experienced a boom in air traffic and passenger numbers in past few years. This has led to a significant increase in demand for air travel, which has put pressure on the existing air infrastrucure. As a result, airlines are facing difficulties in meeting the increasing demand, and this has resulted in delays, cancellations and other problems. Moreover, many air passengers are also facing problems in getting their bagg",477,184,0.5444444444444444,7.304488726499312,0.8829203881955204,0.051913731728448716,0.8742857142857143,0.8725641025641028,0.7748088296926957,56.25,56.72222222222222,53.97785547785548

A study of the impact of electrical and mechanical infrastructural improvements on the agriculture of New South Wales, Australia, is presented. The study was conducted in the context of a larger study examining the effects of infrastruture improvements and the provision of credit on farm management and production in NSW. A survey of 300 farmers in 20 rural localities was used to examine the effect of electricity and tractor use on management practices, farm size, and farm income. Results showed that electric lighting was associated with a reduction in farm labour, an increase in land area, a decrease in crop production, but an improvement in management efficiency. Tractor use was found to be associated only with increased farm area and a slight reduction of labour.

The paper is based on the premise that ITC can play a significant role in providing basic infrastructural services to the rural population. This is because the ICCs are already present in rural areas and are therefore well positioned to provide these services. In addition, the paper also examines the different types of infrastruc-ture that can be provided by ICDs, and the challenges that they face in doing so. Finally, it looks at some of the ways in which IACs can help to improve the quality of life for rural people.",493,198,0.6119402985074627,7.0837210897671525,0.8997271097573301,0.04714055006587067,0.8640000000000001,0.8825454545454546,0.7828625341645464,62.66062176165803,63.149253731343286,54.38728946337642

The construction industry is one of the most vital sectors of a country’s economy. The industry plays a crucial role in the development of infrastructure and the growth of an economy by providing employment opportunities and contributing to the GDP of countries. However, the construction sector in many countries faces numerous challenges, including delays in project completion, disputes between contractors and clients, and unethical practices. To address these challengers, many nations have enacted construction laws to regulate the industry and protect the interests of all stakeholders. In this article, we will explore the need for a construction law in countries like India, where the sector is growing rapidly but faces significant challenging.
Construction Laws in Other Countries
Many countries have already implemented construction regulations to protect their citizens and ensure the smooth operation of their construction industries.

C.K. Srinivasan
This paper examines the role of policy and infrastructure in promoting agglomerations in the Indian organised manufacturing sector. The paper uses a unique data set of 14,419 establishments in 23 manufacture-intensive sectors, to examine the determinants of agglomeration in India. Results of the analysis show that policy has a limited role in shaping aglomera-tion. However, the infrastructural characteristics of a region have a strong impact on the probability of an establishment to be located in a cluster.

Indian infrastructure,The Scenario of FDI in Infrastructure of India,"The Scenario of FDI in Infrastructure of India
Infrastructural development is the most crucial component of a country’s growth. The infrastructure sector has witnessed a huge growth in India, especially in the last decade. India is a large and fast growing country with a population of 1.2 billion and a rapidly growing economy. In the past, the infrastructures sector was mainly dominated by the public sector. However, in recent years, there has been a shift in this trend with the government now allowing the private sector to participate in infrastrucutral projects.
The government has also taken several steps to improve the ease of doing business in order to attract more foreign investments in these projects, which has led to an increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into India.
