What is Unemployment
Unemployment is a state of being where a person who wants to work or actively seeking work is unable to find a job. However, some countries consider a certain threshold for employment as unemployment.

This article discusses the various reasons why Indian economy is growing at the rate it is. Also, it discusses how it affects the Indian consumer.
Why the growth rate is so high?
- Low interest rates have played a big part. As the central bank of the country has maintained a very low interest rate for over a decade now, banks are able to give loans to the public at low rates. So, many people are now investing in assets and are buying homes, cars etc. The low rate has also encouraged foreign investors to bring in foreign investments to India and help the economy of country grow.

Indian economy,"Indian economy is growing but there is no growth in the rural economy
Indian growth story is a story of two halves—the manufacturing sector is doing well and the services sector has been a disappointment. The manufacturing growth has come at a cost of the slowdown in services.
India is one of those economies which has a unique growth trajectory—it is the only growing large economy which is still dominated by the agriculture sector. But this growth is not inclusive, with agriculture contributing less to growth. This is why agriculture has remained a key concern for the economy. In the 1990s India had been an ‘agrarian economy’. Since then the share of agriculture in GDP has dropped from around 35% in 1960 to less than 18% now. Agriculture contributes around half of India’s workforce. There is also a need for more food production, especially for a rapidly growing population. As a result, India is looking for ways to boost production.

Indian economy,"Indian economy is on the road to recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic-related lockdown. The GDP is expected to grow in FY2022 with a growth of over 5%, as indicated by the government and RBI. While economic activities have started to pick up, there is no clarity on how much it will take for the economy to reach to its pre-pandemic level. With a recovery in GDP growth, the financial stress faced by borrowers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs) would increase. This would impact their ability to repay the debt as their revenues start improving.
The RBI has already taken steps to mitigate the impact of the pandemic by lowering key policy rates and by providing refinance facilities. However, as the crisis continues, a longer term solution for addressing the problem has to be found. To this end, it is proposed to set up a ‘Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme’.

It has to give that away for free. But if that component is imported, that Chinese company does not have that same obligation. The company is free to charge whatever market rate they choose to sell it at.
2. Because Indian firms are not subsidized they have a much higher cost structure than their Chinese counterparts. As a result they are less competitive in global markets and less attractive to foreign investors. Foreign investors will invest in countries where the cost of production is as low as possible.

Indian economy,"Indian economy is growing at 7.5 percent in the third quarter. What do you think the impact of this growth rate on the Indian consumer? Will it lead to the increase in consumer spending?
The Indian economy has been growing for quite some time. But what has not been happening is that the growth is translating directly to increased consumer spend. We have seen a lot of companies, particularly the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector, making a conscious effort to bring down their prices, because that is exactly what the consumers want to see.
For instance, a brand like Hindustan Lever, whose flagship brand is ‘Dettol’, has brought down its prices by 30 percent.

The paper analyses India's economic growth and performance during the period 1997-2006.

This is attributed to the economic reform and liberalisation policies pursued by the Indian government after 91. In the last 10-15 years, the reform process has resulted in a more market driven economy. There is a strong relationship between economic liberalization and economic stability. However, there is no such relationship in recent years. Economic reforms have resulted into an economy where growth is more volatile. It has also resulted to a growth process that is not inclusive.

Indian economy,"Indian economy, which grew by 5.7 per cent in FY17 and is expected to accelerate to 6.5 per cen this fiscal, needs to move to a higher gear for achieving a $5 trillion economy in the next decade, said CII president D.S. Rawat. The Indian economy is at a juncture where it can either choose to follow the “old normal” path or take on the challenge of a high and sustained growth, he said, referring to the government’s vision of achieving the target of 7-8 percen growth by FY20.
According to Rawar, India’ s economy has to grow from 1.6 billion to at least 3 billion people, and from a middle-income economy to one of the richest in world.

Indian economy,"Indian economy has been in a slow down mode since the 2nd half of FY 2019 due to various factors.
The main cause for the slowdown is the high interest rates and the impact of the liquidity situation. This is further aggravated by various external factors like US – China trade war and Brexit. The RBI also hiked the short term borrowing rates by 25 bps in October. With the recent 40 bpps hike it is now up at a 20-year high and has increased the total borrowing costs by more than 200 bpts over the last 15 months. RBI may increase rates further to 6% by the end of fiscal year 2020. It should be noted that the current inflation rate is at over 4%.
