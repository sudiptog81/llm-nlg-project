From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The climate of the Indian region varies greatly across its large area, with temperatures and precipitation changing with elevation. Most of it lies in the tropical climatic zone.
[edit] Regions
India has a tropical climate and is divided into five climate zones, as follows:
- Tropical monsoon zone (Tropical wet monsoons)
This is the region between the Tropic of Cancer (~23.5° North latitude) and the Equator ~5.0°. There is a marked seasonal variation in both precipitation and temperature in this zone, and this is one of only two climates — the other being the subtropical humid climate – in which there is precipitation throughout the year. The average annual precipitation ranges from 1000 mm (""monsoonal"" rainfall) in south-western India to 2500mm in north-eastern India.

The Government of India released the first national strategy for climate resilience and adaptation in December 2009, with the aim of building the capacity required to address the challenges posed by climate variability and climate induced disaster risk.
With the assistance of the World Bank, the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) of Government India developed the strategy based on the principles of climate risk management and vulnerability assessment. The document identifies the climate risks that the country is likely to face in the coming decades and provides a policy and programmatic framework for the effective management of these risks. It is based upon three key principles:
- Adaptation to climate extremes: The strategy recognises climate adaptation as a key strategy to ensure sustainable development. In particular, it emphasises the need to enhance climate awareness among citizens and local communities, and to build the capacities necessary for effective adaptation to extreme climate events and for disaster preparedness at the community and",4,185,,0.5166666666666667,6.931810730249348,0.8728359628823505,0.056385220335856696,0.8457142857142858,0.8512820512820516,0.7484832619412929,50.73228433098591,50.82222222222222,54.56385281385282

Indian climate,"Indian climate change policy and the challenge of climate justice
Abstract
This contribution argues that India’s climate policy should address both climate and development justice. India will face a climate catastrophe without a strong and ambitious climate mitigation policy. It is thus important that the government of India takes responsibility for climate protection and compensates for the costs of the transition to a low-carbon economy by supporting adaptation projects in other countries, and by providing funds to developing countries as an adaptation contribution. Climate justice requires that developed countries assume responsibility in the first place, but the current climate crisis also requires a global response, including from India. To ensure a successful global climate agreement, it is essential that rich countries provide the financial and technological resources they have promised for developing country adaptation. The paper discusses some of these issues from a German, European and global perspective, using Germany’ s Climate Protection Programme as a basis for comparison.

The Action plan sets out India’s long-term vision for a low-emissions, resilient development pathway that will enable it to contribute its fair share to global efforts to tackle climate
change and help meet the international climate targets.
This policy has the potential to help India to achieve its climate goals in the long term and reduce its carbon footprint. A key feature of this is the need to build up the country’ s carbon sinks, including the agricultural land. To achieve this, the National Agriculture and Climate change action Plan (NACP) will be developed in

The “2014 Arctic Report Card,” published last month, was based on an analysis of a year of satellite temperature data. But the report did not include a crucial graph, which showed that Arctic temperatures were falling. That was because the graph was not produced by the researchers. It was produced in response to a Freedom of Information request, and the original graph did include that crucial trend. R. Mathew’ report pointed to the ‘missing graph.’
Mathews said that it is a “‘smoking gun’ that the U.N. is trying to keep the general public in the dark, about the true state of the Arctic.” Matheny’ graph shows that temperatures in Arctic are dropping, not rising as the UN claimed.

The Indian government’s approach to climate policy is not based on a comprehensive framework. In fact, a 2014 assessment of climate policies in 18 developing countries, including India, shows a clear divergence between the country’ s commitments to addressing climate risk and the actions it is taking to do so.
India’ss approach is fragmented and reactive, with policy-making largely driven by a focus on energy and environment ministries and, more recently, climate ministries at the national and state levels. The ‘bottom up’ approach has resulted in an inconsistent, piecemeal policy approach that lacks a coherent framework and fails to adequately incorporate climate risks into development planning. This has contributed to policy ineffectiveness, in turn leading to a weak climate finance pipeline, despite the fact that the Paris Agreement requires a substantial increase in funding from developed to developing nations.

In this Policy Paper, Climate Change in India’s Energy Transition: Challenges and Opportunities, we present the case for rethinking the Indian energy transition in the context of climate policy. This involves a radical change in energy planning, with a shift from the traditional model based on large-scale centralised generation to a distributed model with local generation, and from fossil fuels to renewables. We argue that this will bring a range of advantages including greater resilience, security and sustainability.
India has been at the forefront of the global climate movement and has pledged to reduce emissions by 33% of 2005 levels by the year 2030.

So in this post we would like to introduce you 3 tips on how to reduce your body heat in India. Let’s have a look at it…
- Avoid spicy and fried food-
Eating too much spicy foods can also cause body heating. If you don’t want to feel hot, try to avoid eating spicy food and instead of it try eating fresh and green veggies. Also try avoiding too many fried dishes and rather have steamed and roasted food. This way your food would have less spice and would not have to go through so much heat. In addition to this you can always eat some yogurt with salt and pepper to get some coolness. And don't forget to drink plenty of water!

Indian climate,"Indian climate scientists are worried about the effects of climate change on Indian agriculture. The effects include an earlier flowering season. This is because of an increase in temperature.
Flower blooming is a critical stage in agriculture production. It is during this stage that farmers decide whether to cultivate or not. They decide when to apply fertilizers. In addition, they choose the type of seed to plant. And they decide if they will irrigate the fields or rely on rains. These decisions determine how much a field will produce. A longer growing season will affect the crop yields in a negative manner. Therefore, it is important for India to take immediate action to mitigate climate effects. Here are some suggestions.

Climate change is a reality. It threatens the future of humanity. The world is witnessing the devastating impacts of climate disruption. In a global warming world, we will witness unprecedented impacts such as sea level rise, more powerful storms that will affect coastal regions, heat waves, floods and droughts in all regions of the world. These impacts will be particularly acute in poor and vulnerable countries of Africa and Latin America.
We know that the main cause of this climate emergency is the burning of fossil fuels by rich industrial nations over the past few centuries. Now that we have reached an alarming tipping point, it is essential that governments around the globe take the necessary steps to curb emissions and mitigate climate impacts. However, the most urgent and important thing to be done, in order to limit climate disaster, is for governments to act quickly and decisively to reduce emissions.

They often suffer from the menstrual disorder. Many women face pain during menstruation. In this situation, they do not feel comfortable and their routine work is disturbed.
Women face different menstrual problems like painful periods, PMS, heavy bleeding, menstrual cramps, etc. Menstrual cramps are caused due to the hormone progesterone, which controls the uterus lining of the womb.

In 1992 the government introduced a national programme to promote sustainable housing.
Energy demand has increased with an increase of 3.9% per annum. 80% of total energy production is derived from non-renewable sources. This has led to the increase in energy prices and energy demand. It can be seen from the graphs below that demand of energy for electricity, oil, gas and coal has gone up by 10%.
This has caused a lot of issues.

In the Indian context, climate is a function of the location of a meteorological station, the type of weather observed and the season in which it occurs (i.e., the meteorogical year), which varies from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere. It is therefore imperative to understand the differences of climate across various latitudes to be able to study and predict the impacts of climatic changes on the ecosystem.
India has a wide range of climates from equatorial to polar and from Mediterranean to semi-arid and arid. The average temperature varies with elevation as does rainfall; however, these two factors are highly inter-related. In India, rainfall varies greatly across the country as well as with the seasons and altitude due to orographic effects.

The study revealed that in New Delhi alone, 2.7 lakh premature and avoidable deaths occur each year due primarily to poor air quality. According to the study, in India, the air in a room can be 50 times more polluted than the outdoors. This is due largely to indoor sources of pollution such as cooking fires, and burning of incense. The study also pointed out the dangers of using coal and wood fire as a source of heating, which leads to a high concentration of harmful pollutants.

Global warming is a real issue in India, and one that is being felt most acutely by poor and rural communities.
Climate change in the developing world is not only a result of the industrial revolution in Europe and America. As the world becomes increasingly developed, more and more of a warming effect is coming from India and China. In the next 100 years, China is projected to be responsible for 20 per cent of all greenhouse gases. India has an important role in helping develop solutions to climate crisis and has the most people at risk from it. This is because of its huge population, low per capita emissions, high reliance on fossil fuels, large agricultural base and poor infrastructure. It is estimated that 1 million people per year die prematurely of air pollution alone, which is exacerbated by climate-related issues such as extreme weather events. The health impacts from extreme events in developing countries have been described as “a slow motion climate catastrophe for the poor,”",314,193,,0.5625,7.794228634059948,0.8905630715407273,0.047929255712532766,0.9142857142857144,0.9133333333333318,0.8124813273306545,69.94455410541201,72.72395833333333,69.26301024556838

AbstractThis article discusses India’s climate policy since 1882. After a brief introduction into the history of climate-related policies in India, it outlines the country’ s current climate targets, namely to reduce CO2 emissions by 10 percent by the year 2020. It is argued that climate protection in the Indian context is not a new development but a result of a long-term policy. The article argues that the new policy has its roots in earlier policies and thus it is more of an evolution than of revolution. India does not yet possess a strong climate movement or an efficient climate politics. A climate activist movement is needed, especially if one takes into account the long history and the potential to learn from other climate movements.

In summer, India becomes a furnace for living beings. As a result, it has become imperative to install air conditioning systems to keep the temperatures in check and make life comfortable.
The Indian heat is not only a seasonal problem. Summer is just one season. Winter too, is no less severe and has its own set of problems. If it is cold, the people have to suffer the chill. They have no recourse to protect themselves. There is little respite from the extreme cold. This is why air conditioners find a great demand and are popular in India.

Indian climate,"Indian climate change policy: a critique of policy analysis
This paper presents a critical review of some aspects of the policy process that have been the focus of research in international environmental negotiations. The paper examines the role of science and technology in this process in the context of India's position and its experience in climate diplomacy. It argues that the science–technology policy interface is a key part of this policy making process but is not well understood within the academic literature and policy practice. As a result, the process of negotiating climate technology cooperation is fraught with difficulties and often leads to policy incoherence.
The authors conclude that, despite some progress, more work is needed to address the underlying causes of scientific and technological uncertainties, as well as the political and economic factors that shape policy responses. They also highlight the need to strengthen and build upon the existing science-policy interface by creating a new type of institution, such as climate policy centres, that can bridge the gap between science policy and climate",355,199,,0.5440414507772021,7.558065382861293,0.8843310518200896,0.050608640493957066,0.8799999999999999,0.8797633136094665,0.7687433600931745,57.72012061403508,56.74611398963731,58.07017017017017

Abstract
India is a developing country, one of the most affected by climate variability and change. The country is experiencing a number of problems related to climate and climate extremes, which are becoming increasingly more intense with global warming. These problems are affecting all aspects of life in India, especially human life, agriculture, energy production and use, ecosystems, and coastal zones. India has a rich and diverse history in climate related research. However, climate issues and their management were never considered as a priority issue in the Indian society.

Climate change is an important term and has gained a great deal of popularity in recent times. It denotes a change or a shift in climatic characteristics over a certain period, which is believed to have been caused by the increase in greenhouse gas concentration in the earth's atmosphere.
As per the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes, the term 'Climate Change' was coined for the first time in 1979, and was then used as a synonym for ""global warming.""

Indian climate,"Indian climate is changing and is expected to continue to worsen in the coming 50-100 years. This will result in severe impacts across all ecosystems. However, the magnitude of these impacts will depend on the level of climate change and the adaptive capacity and vulnerability of ecosystems and societies.
As of 2011, India had 4.5 million sq km of forest area. Out of it, 3.4 million were degraded, which is about 74 per cent degradation rate.

Abstract
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an inter-governmental body created by World Meteorological Organization & United Nations Environment Program in 1988 as a scientific assessment of climate by various scientific bodies. The IPcc was established for the assessment, review and update of science relating to all aspects of climatic change including human influence. IPpc has been publishing its assessments of scientific literature on climate changes every six years. Since 1990 it has published five assessment reports in the form of a Summary for Policy Makers and three Assessment Reports. These reports provide a comprehensive analysis on a variety of issues related to climate.

The 1990 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change established a common goal for nations, but the lack of binding commitments means it has not been effective. The Kyoto Protocol was adopted as a result of the negotiations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and is considered a legally binding agreement. As of 2007, 183 countries have ratified the treaty. A total of about 35 industrial countries are responsible for nearly 90% of all carbon dioxide emissions from 1851 to 1910, while China and US account for 30%. The ""Kyoto Protocol"" is based on a three-part framework that sets emissions reductions targets by the industrial nations for the period 2012 to the year 2020; and establishes mechanisms for financing the transfer of technology and financial resources to developing nations to reduce emissions.
