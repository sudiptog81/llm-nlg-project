The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned that India is likely to experience extreme heat waves in future, especially in summer months. This is because of the increase of greenhouse gases in atmosphere. It is also because the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface is increasing. As a result, there is more heat energy available to warm up the Earth. According to the IMD, this is causing a rise in average temperate by about 2°F every decade.

Indian climate,"Indian climate change adaptation: A case of institutional inertia?
India has been identified as one of the countries most vulnerable to climate variability and change. Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on water availability, agriculture, health, and the environment in India. Yet, despite its vulnerability to the impact of climate variation and climate-related natural hazards, India has yet to develop an institutionally robust climate adaptation strategy.
This paper presents an analysis of India's climate policy and adaptation strategies. It argues that the absence of a robust institution to coordinate adaptation efforts and lack of clarity on the role of institutions in climate governance are two key reasons why adaptation has not been prioritized in the country. The paper also identifies the following as reasons for the inability of Indian institutions to respond to adaptation needs:
Lack of recognition of adaptation as a distinct policy domain;

Indian climate,"Indian climate change report
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published a special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C. The report was approved by 66 governments after a marathon two-week meeting in Incheon, South Korea. It warns that warmer temperatures will have severe and irreversible impact on nature and people.
Scientists warn that the world is heading for a climate catastrophe if global temperatues rise by more than 2° Celsius. But the report says that even a 0.4° increase will cause a rise in sea levels, more heatwaves and droughts, and an increase in extreme rainfall. This is a huge increase on current predictions. Previous reports have suggested a temperature increase of less than two degrees. For example, the 5th Assessment Report (AR5",184,196,0.6066666666666667,7.430118886442307,0.9002570017082938,0.04583585264479666,0.8999999999999999,0.9012698412698413,0.8240360481388084,83.81922442420344,81.54,78.45990078544853
Indian climate,"Indian climate change and water policy: a case for integrated approaches
In a recent paper, published in the journal Climate Policy, researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, India, explore the implications of climate variability and change on India’s water resources.
The paper presents a review of the literature on climate impacts on water availability in India. It also discusses how climate policy can be designed to address water-related climate risks. The authors highlight that, while climate-change impact studies are increasingly being conducted, there is a need for a more integrated approach to climate and development planning. This would help to better understand the complex interactions between climate, water and other sectors. Such an integrated framework can help identify the most vulnerable regions, and thus inform policy decisions. For example, in areas where water is already scarce, climate policies may need to focus on adaptation measures,",185,198,0.5573770491803278,7.540056963736643,0.887798273686103,0.04959299532405179,0.8457142857142858,0.8563522012578613,0.7923037901566894,58.24729241877256,62.14207650273224,55.66714612618503

The climate is changing in India. The average temperature in the country has risen by 0.7 degrees Celsius in 100 years, and the average annual rainfall has decreased by three percent. In addition, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, cyclones and heat waves are increasing. These changes are already having a significant impact on India’ s economy, society and environment.

The 2014 IPCC report on climate impacts on India
Climate change is the change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time. In other words, climate is a state of the atmosphere, defined by patterns of temperature, rainfall, wind speed, and other meteorological variables in a given region. Climate can be considered as the average weather, or more rigorously, as an average condition over a 30-year period.

In the past few decades, the Indian monsoon has become increasingly variable. The rains have become more unpredictable, and the seasonal cycle has lengthened.
The Indian Ocean Dipole is a climate pattern that affects the mon­soons. It is the dominant mode of variability in the climate of the Indo-Pacific region. Its influence on the South Asian mono­sons is well documented. In recent dec­ades the IOD has shifted to a positive phase more frequently, resulting in a more frequent and more intense drought in India. This has caused a substantial loss of crop yield and livestock, especially in southern India, which is dependent on rainfall.
